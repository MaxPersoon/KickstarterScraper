We thought this was impossible. The generosity we received inspired us to work harder, and make more. In the past year, we've toured an evening-length work (for the first time ever!), produced an oversold solo show at The Bushwick Starr, found a home in New Brooklyn Theatre, received the inaugural Harkness Promise Award at the Dance Magazine awards, received the Breakout Award from the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation, named the Resident Commissioned Artist at Live Arts, and premiered a commission in the legacy of Agnes de Mille. In just one year! And it wouldn't have happened without you. So now, we�re putting on our fundraising hats again in gearing up for another 24-hour Tele-Gala-Dance-A-Thon and some folks are wondering why...? With the successes of the last 12 months, surely we have enough funding? It�s true, our forward momentum is incredible, but it isn't enough to sustain the company financially. Two months ago we began paying the dancers for rehearsals because we are finally able to afford it, but we are only able to afford it for the next year or two. New Brooklyn Theatre is providing the feath3r theory with a legitimate company model, but the organization does not have significant funding of its own. It's up to us to continue to push forward and build the sustainability that we need to keep making the work for years to come. We hope we can continue to make genre-bending, surreal, and human work you have continued to support. Our goal this year is to raise $15,000 to help support the company�s new works: We May Never Dance Again, a world premiere for The Invisible Dog that will be performed live during the 24-hour event WEDNESDAY, a work slated to premiere at Live Arts in Fall 2020 The McCarthy Era, a work slated to premiere at HERE Arts in Spring 2021 Fantasia, a dream project currently in its infancy The money we raise goes towards artist fees, administrative support and our yearly operating costs! ABOUT THE FEATH3R THEORY the feath3r theory began making work in 2009 and we had our first world premiere in 2013. The mission of the feath3r theory is to challenge its audience (and its creators) to collectively interrogate -and celebrate - its shared relationship to human empathy and personal ethics as expressed in (and distorted by) popular media. By unabashedly appropriating the structures, themes, and aesthetics of reality television, celebrity culture, social media and the internet, the work of TF3T synthesizes dance, visual media and narrative theater into virtuosic, expansive pop-culture phenomena or an �Gesamtkunstwerk� in which artists and audience alike experience their shared humanity. the feath3r theory is a project of New Brooklyn Theatre, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Members of the feath3r theory include Raja Feather Kelly (Artistic Director), Zain Alam (Composer), Emily Auciello (Sound Design), You-Shin Chen (Scenic Design), Kate Enman (Photographer), Erika Foley (Stage Manager), Alexandria Giroux (Performer), Amy Gernux (Performer), Sara Gurevich (Performer), Rebecca Hite (Performer), Kalin Imar (Performer), Rachel Pritzlaff (Performer and Executive Director), Collin Ranf (Performer), Aaron Moses Robin (Performer), Coel Rodriguez (Performer), Laura Snow (Video Editor), Candace Taylor (Performer), Benjamin Wolk (Performer), and Tuce Yasak (Lighting Designer)."

Our show strives to be culturally relevant, current, fun, but also document today and the last 40 years in such a way that on occasion we have a show that should go in a time capsule for future anthropologists, or aliens, or cockroaches. We recorded 13 episodes remotely from the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in 2017, and have been invited back for this year�s upcoming festival, June 13- 16. We have never solicited sponsors for the podcast until making some effort to obtain sponsorship to support this Bonnaroo trip. While we have made some inroads with a few brands towards future partnerships, the timing just wasn�t right at the moment for those brands interested in aligning themselves with the show. As a last ditch effort, we have launched this Kickstarter campaign. We are only trying to raise enough funds to recoup our hard costs, which are approximately $3,500. These funds are our hard costs and go towards a Class B RV rental, gas for driving from New Orleans, food & supplies/ gear. Our friends at Bonnaroo are giving us press credentials, a production area trailer in which to record, and a complementary space for our RV. We will travel with all audio recording gear from our New Orleans studio. While we are a New Orleans culture podcast, as evidenced in our 2017 shows from Bonnaroo, we�re able to find plenty of New Orleans related subject matter at one of the biggest and festivals in the world. Guests from Bonnaroo 2017 included Greg Harris, the CEO of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame; Patrick Clifford who produced the Neville Brothers� Yellow Moon album; and Rick Farman, original founder of Superfly Presents (started in New Orleans) and promoter of Bonnaroo. Bonnaroo, named after the Dr. John album, and is a creole term meaning 'good stuff', is intrinsically tied to New Orleans and the spirit of our show."

We've dreamt up a multifaceted, month-long residency held at Base: Experimental Arts + Space, July 1-27, 2019, providing the Seattle dance community with: Daily movement practices, ranging from all-abilities classes to rigorous professional training. Collaborative creation residencies, culminating in public workshops and informal showings. Community-centric conversations surrounding different themes encompassing sustainable art-making today. Innovative, thoughtful, accessible performances, celebrating Seattle's vibrant creative scene. PILOT 2019, Design by Andrew JS and Emma Wheeler WHY WE'RE HERE PILOT is an opportunity to support, to move, to talk, to document, to include, to see, to share, and to make space for collaboration, exploration, problem solving and conversation. We're here to figure out how, as young movers and makers, we can not only fine tune our artistic voices, but garner skills to find agency, build community, and keep Seattle dance propelling forward. ""Due to concerns over money, time, rates, booking and sustainability generally, artists tend to silo themselves and therefore, can lack the capacity to consider and engage with the greater arts community. This program feels radical because it brings artists together to share space, workshops, discussions, and showings. It�s inspiring and I hope it can inspire future program development. This way of working, sharing, and collaborating feels like dance sustainability on a whole new level."" -Thomas House WHO WE ARE A group of 6 emerging dance professionals, eager to reunite in Seattle where we began collaboration as YC2, a collective of young dance artists mentored and supported by Studio Kate Wallich. PILOT Creative Team: Laura Carella (Seattle) Dominica Greene (New York/Salt Lake City) Carlin Kramer (Seattle) Emma Lawes (New York/Seattle) Alex Quetell (Los Angeles) Emma Wheeler (Seattle) YC2 in rehearsal, photo by Tom Weinberger In an effort to provide support to makers beyond our collective, we're excited to welcome 3 Resident Artists to the space who are at various stages of their careers, are deeply ingrained in the Seattle dance community and whose work reflects empowerment and inclusivity. Resident artists will have access to the space for new creations and opportunities to share their research through showings and workshops.

How can we, outside of financial sustainability, how can we sustain each other in community? How can we be open to the fact that [we're] doing different things, and still 100% be there to support each other?"" -Dani Tirrell Dani Tirrell, photo by Naomi Ishisaka WHERE YOU COME IN First and foremost, our goal with PILOT is to foster a healthy space for education, training, and research. This largely includes being able to properly compensate the artists involved. From performers to teachers to discussion facilitators to media designers to photographers to costume designers to lighting designers to house managers ... we want these artists to be fully compensated to reflect our ethos of sustainability. It will take a total of $10,000 to pay our well-deserving, highly skilled collaborators, and all funds raised from this campaign will go directly towards that goal. These artists will not only make PILOT what it is, but have proven themselves time and time again as vital, generous contributors to Seattle's creative community. Help us support them! *All donations are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE via our fiscal sponsor: Studio Kate Wallich.* We are over the moon excited to launch this thing.

But, then, what else should I have expected from the author of Sweet Adversity, a masterfully-executed 600-page seriocomic novel about alcoholic Siamese twin wannabe jazz musicians? Subtitled A Jungian Fable of Family and Finance Across the Twentieth Century, Newlove's darkly comic novel, originally written in 1998, is the sweeping saga of one family's greed, extortion, and double-crossing as they strive to acquire a controlling interest in the world's wealth. It is also the story of Billy Baxter, heir to this massive fortune who, with the help of a married couple of Chinese-Swiss Jungian psychoanalysts (one of whom he has fallen in love with), seeks atonement for his family's sins. As an added twist that only a first-rate storyteller like Newlove could credibly pull off, Baxter also happens to be descendent from an ancient clan of humanoid wolves on the brink of extinction.

As a reporter, book reviewer, and short story writer, his work appeared in Esquire, New York Magazine, Evergreen Review, and The Saturday Review. His first novel, The Painter Gabriel (1970), was hailed by Time Magazine as ""one of the best fictional studies of madness, descent, and purification that any American has written since Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Newlove is the author of several other novels, a series of books on the art of writing, and the critically acclaimed memoir, Those Drinking Days: Myself and Other Writers (1981).

After our Shark Tank episode aired, so many awesome Teachers, OTs and Special Needs Educators emailed us and asked us to create a Teacher Kit for their classrooms, so we're here to Kickstart it right to our product line! While we didn't get a deal, teachers and parents were shocked! Our family was bummed that a Shark didn't ""pick us up"" but we had a ton of fun, learned a lot about our product--- like how teachers love it--- AND best of all the Sharks were really supportive of our product, even though some of them though we were ""too new"" for an investment. We're here at Kickstarter to help raise the funds to bring Kudo Banz to classrooms! Sticker charts are always, well, stuck! Kudo Banz �unsticks� the sticker chart and puts it right on a child�s wrist where they can always keep their goals in sight and in mind, making positive reinforcement easier and more effective! Because it�s on their wrist kids can remember the things they are working on. Just like adults need ""bands"" to remember their ""Steps� and sticky notes to get things done, kids need visual reminders too! Kudo Banz has been tested and loved by some of the very best in the industry. From Parents to Psychologists, Expert Moms to Industry Experts, we've won ten industry awards! While sticker charts and clip charts are always ""stuck"" on the wall, Kudo Banz is busy making it easier for kids to reach their goals, while making classroom management easier too! Since Kudo Banz is always right there on their wrists, kids can remember what they are working on whether they are at stations, in the hall or even in music class. This connects the entire school climate and creates a positive reinforcement tool that helps develop social and emotional learning throughout the school. Kudo Banz aligns with today's school initiatives and competencies like PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports), Growth Mindset, and SEL (Social & Emotional Learning). �I watched your episode on Shark Tank and instantly thought of my classroom� -Special Education Teacher, AL �Half the battle is keeping kids goals on top of their mind- this does that and more!� -Pediatric Occupational Therapist, CA ""We received our package yesterday and hit the ground running. He enjoyed the story. We made very easy goals. Eat all our meals, clean our toys, and take our bath without fighting us. I immediately shared with his ABA therapist. I personally think this is great as reward charts aren�t tangible. Put a sticker and leave it. The bracelet is a constant reminder of the goals and end result spinning the wheel."" -Parent of a 5 year old, NJ ""Amazing, this will work wonders in our 2nd grade class!� -Second Grade Teacher, MA ""Kudo Banz has been a wonderful tool for reinforcing positive behavior in my children.They are encouraging each other and seeking family time rewards."" -Kindergarten Teacher & Mom of 3, CT 1. Read the Drago & George storybook with your class. This introduces the concept of Kudo Banz in a really easy and fun way! At the end of the book there is a spot to set goals. 2. Hand out the Banz to your class. Each child starts with an empty band to fill with kudos for the day. 3. Kids earn Kudos for their goals, like good listening. This keeps kids motivated to continue building good behaviors and turning them into habits. 4. As kids fill their banz and reach their goals, they take off the kudos and add them to the Classroom Jar! They start again the next day. Once the Jar is filled the classroom unlocks the magical reward wheel and earns a classroom reward! + + + Kudo Banz is SUPER flexible. We made it so that it adapts to different classrooms and behaviors. Kudo Banz can be used as a group goal or for individual goals. Teacher can set it up they way it works best for them! Some teachers have kids earn an individual prize once they've filled their band, some teachers fill the classroom jar and then the classroom gets a group prize. Some teachers give out three Kudos, some teachers have kids slide their Kudo from 1 to 2 to 3. Some earn 3 per day, some earn 1 per day and build on it. The best part about Kudo Banz is that it's flexible! Teachers can set it up any way they'd like. (Social & Emotional Learning) Kudo Banz aligns with SEL because Kudo Banz: Builds students up by building their confidence, and focusing on the positive. Through inclusion and goal setting, Kudo Banz can work on specific SEL behaviors like understanding others. Kudo Banz is structured so that kids can feel included and appreciated, all kids wear a band and work toward their goals individually as well in a group. Since kids have a plan, they are more likely to make constructive choices about personal behavior and social interactions. Because Kudo Banz is always on their wrist, students can remember and self-regulate their behavior and emotions, stay mindful of their goals, stay on-task and listen attentively. Models positivity towards others so that students can learn to build others up instead of knocking them down. Builds kids confidence so they feel confident in participating in classroom discussions. Kudo Banz creates opportunities for students to be responsible in the classroom. By being mindful of their goals, kids can stay on-task and make connections between their choices and potential consequences. Because they are working on a group goal, students feel like they are a part of the group and are more open to using the support and feedback from peers to improve to reach the group goal. (Work hard and accept challenges as opportunities to grow) Kudo Banz aligns with Growth Mindset becuase Kudo Banz: Teaches students the feeling of success by setting up small achievable goals. As students feel the success they get hooked- and their confidence grows. Models persistence to reach their goals Creates a sense of community where other's achievements can be celebrated Builds a sense of confidence, which may lead to taking on more challenging tasks Encourages kids to take on challenges and learn from them, therefore increasing their abilities and achievement Through Kudo Banz, positive affirmation is given to students on a consistent basis which makes students feel good and know that their efforts can lead to positive results. (Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports) Kudo Banz aligns with PBIS becuase Kudo Banz: Sets a clear plan in place; students and teaches set goals together, creating a plan that kids are a part of. Since they had the opportunity to self assess and set up a plan together, students better understand their goals and feel more vested in reaching them. Focuses on the positive behavior, minimizing attention to the negative behavior Creates learning opportunities that emphasize the desired behaviors Is easy and quick to use which helps the teacher maintain instructional time to the remainder of the class. Is flexible, can be used for many different behaviors and on an individual or group goal. Uses inclusion; Kudo Banz can be used as a classroom goal and/or can be set up as an individual plan working on shaping specific behaviors. Can be used in conjunction with PBIS feedback guidelines: Functional, Accurate/Consistent, Specific, Timely. Connecting Home and School Because it�s right there on students wrists, it goes where children go. For tough behaviors, it can be use both at home and at school, creating a strong consistent message between home and school. When used together, Kudo Banz works as a united message because of the connection that is consistent at home and school. After Shark Tank so many awesome Teachers, OTs and Special Needs Educators emailed us and asked us to create a Teacher Kit for their classrooms, so we're here to Kickstart it right to our product line! While we didn't get a deal, teachers and parents were shocked! Our family was bummed that a Shark didn't ""pick us up"" but we had a ton of fun, learned a lot about our product--- like how teachers love it--- AND best of all the Sharks were really supportive of our product, even though some of them thought we were ""too new"" for an investment. That's why we're here to help raise the funds to bring Kudo Banz to classrooms! Hi there! I�m Amanda, founder, and mom of 3. When my first little one was three years old, I wanted my little guy to grow up believing in himself, but the old parenting methods like yelling and time-outs just left us both unhappy and sent him the wrong message. I knew something had to change so I read a looooot of books and did a bunch of research. That�s when I turned to the sticker chart method. Problem was, we were always on-the-go, and the sticker chart was always stuck at home. My little guy and I couldn�t remember it! So I invented Kudo Banz, a sticker chart for his wrist! I knew I wanted him to grow up confident and proud of who he was, so I started focusing on the positive instead of the negative. Simple things like leaving the park, trying new foods and cleaning up stopped being such a struggle. His No�s turned into Yes�s and he went from �I can�t� to �I�ll try�. He was excited and proud and the whole family was happier. I went on to use Kudo Banz with my other two little ones, Ayaan who is a year and a half younger than Mickey, and Sofia, my youngest. Kudo Banz taught them to grow up confident too. Sofia learned to try new foods and dress for the weather (she�s a girl who only loves sundresses, even in winter!). I always dreamed of spreading positivity and helping other kids and parents who has the same daily struggles. Then, my husband Hamza encouraged me to follow my dreams and make Kudo Banz a reality! Now our entire family works together to bring the power of positivity to parents and kids everywhere! NOW and WOW are two of our values. It's important to us that we deliver on time and that you're 100% happy when it arrives on your doorstep. As soon as we meet our funding goal we will begin production of the Kudo Banz Classroom Kit. We will need 30-60 days for that, plus some QC time & transit time. We are confident we will have the Kudo Banz Classroom Kit ready for you by July. We are so happy to have you along on this journey. Invest in the supplies needed to create and manufacture the Classroom Kit. This includes tooling, moulds, packaging and labor. We already have an awesome factory that works hard to bring Kudo Banz to families, so we'll utilize their same talents to create the Classroom Pack for classrooms. If we reach our stretch goal of $25,000 we will use the extra Kickstarter funds to write, illustrate & produce a special hardcover, classroom specific storybook! If we reach this goal, we'll include this book in your Classroom Kit for FREE, instead of our general Drago & George storybook. What can I do to help reach the stretch goal? Please share! The more awesome teachers, OTs and therapists know about our new Classroom Kit, the easier it will be to reach our stretch goal! Share This Project! You can share this campaign on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter: @kudobanz or by Email: (link to our campaign) Kickstarter allows new ideas to come to life through community support. Project creators (like Kudo Banz) set a funding goals. If people like the product, they can pledge money to make it happen. Pledging money to a Kickstarter campaign is easy. It's essentially the same as pre-ordering a product. For example, if we reach our funding goal of $3,000, Kudo Banz will be able to initiate our first big production run of the Classroom Kit. The product will be manufactured and sent out to all of our wonderful supporters this summer! If for some reason the campaign does not reach the funding goal, all backers money will be refunded in full.

Short and Sweet: No stretch goals and this campaign ends at the same time as school for my kids. New to Shirts by Shurts? Read on. I love board games. I enjoy sitting down with family and friends and playing a game together. Its a great opportunity to catch up with friends. Board games offer me the chance to help my kids learn important life lessons and skills. They give my wife and me a quiet night in after the kids are in bed. I wanted to show off my love of gaming to others. I have picked up a few t-shirts over the years, but nothing I could wear to the office. After not finding what I wanted, I created Shirts by Shurts. A polo shirt that offers a professional look while still showing off my favorite hobby. After 2 successful campaigns and numerous designs and colors, almost 1000 Shirts by Shurts polos are being worn all over the world. I wear one to work at least once a week. And now I'm back because my kids wanted in on the action. They wanted shirts just like Dad has. So now the junior gamers in your life can look just as good as you do. I am offering my shirts in select colors in youth sizes in addition to adult sizes. Each polo shirt features a simple, but easily recognizable, symbol from the world of table top games. A crest design is embroidered in a contrasting or coordinating color on the left chest. I evaluated many suppliers to find a polo shirt that matched my quality standards. I've worn and washed these shirts many times and am very happy with the final product. Tagless: There's no tag scratching your neck Poly/Cotton Blend: The soft touch of cotton, but no shrinking and easy care Pique Texture: For its great look and durability Range of Sizes: Available Youth Sizes Small, Medium and Large and in Men's from S to 6XL and Women's from S to 4XL. Tall sizes are also available for Men's in some colors - noted with a ""T"" on the graphic. Below are all of the color combinations available for this campaign. These colors are available in Youth, Women's and Men's sizes. Choose from a selection of classic Shirts by Shurts colors and designs or from some of the exciting new options: Youth Sizes are as follows: Small (size 6-8), Medium (10-12) and Large (14-16) I have had a lot of great feedback from my previous Kickstarters. Originally Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower had this to say about my shirts: They look like nice polo shirts and they have these ... logos in them that you at first glance you don't even know it's a board game so that's kind of cool. It kind of gives it a classy look. I received lots of positive feedback from previous backers: ""They look and feel great. I love being able to wear a gaming shirt to work. Nicely done."" ""Once again, I am the best-dressed guy on the block. Thanks for another unqualified success."" - Repeat Backer ""Wore the first one today - the OG Meeple. Got a few comments from co-workers. I'll try out the Hex tomorrow. Loved the shirt - very comfortable all day long."" ""I gave my BF his for xmas and he LOVES it. The fit is PERFECT for him! I'll definitely be getting more. Thanks!"" I'm keeping the reward levels very simple. Only one option, but feel free to add up to 9 more shirts (10 total) to either level. You'll be able to select the colors and sizes of each shirt after the campaign ends during the survey. Just add $22 for each additional Youth Sized shirt and $27 for each additional Adult sized shirt. For each Extended and Tall sized shirt add these amounts to your pledges now. Once the campaign is over you won't be able to edit your pledge. Any of the shirts marked with a ""T"" are available in Tall sizes. Only want 1 Adult shirt? Just add $5 to the single shirt pledge level (plus any extra for extended sizes). No stretch goals for this campaign. All of the colors and designs that are being offered are already unlocked. If you were hoping for a design or color from a previous campaign send me a message with the size you are looking for. I have a very limited stock of shirts from the previous campaigns I will offer at a reduced price on a first come, first serve basis. Shipping is already added when you make your pledge. Any additional cost of shipping extra shirts is built into the add-on price of each shirt. Note for International Backers: Shipping outside of the US is NOT customs friendly. All of these shirts will be shipped from the US. If there are additional costs for entering your country you will be responsible for those costs. I understand that shipping outside of the US is expensive, unfortunately at the volumes I ship there aren't any economical options. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

Famous authors such as William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and Emily Bronte all utilized the meaning of flowers in their writings, and now you can experience the language of flowers in this newest wallet game from Wingspan designer Elizabeth Hargrave, artist Beth Sobel, and Button Shy Games. (Also includes a solo expansion by Mike Mullins - see below for more info.) Featuring I-Split-You-Choose drafting, players draw 2 cards and offer one face-up and another face-down to their neighbor. The neighbor takes their choice and the active player receives the other. After everyone has 4 cards, face-down cards are revealed and everyone scores their collection. After 3 rounds the scores are totaled to determine a winner! If you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy: We're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists. We release a new wallet game every month. This is game #52! Our wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability. Each game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey. If you want to know more about anything... games, rules questions, join an already wonderful community at our discord channel: https://discord.gg/pf9DPqs The active player draws two cards and looks at them. They will need to offer both to their neighbor, except one will be face-up and the other will be face down. Their neighbor will choose one card and the active player receives the other, so the decision here is very important. Once they decide which card to reveal, they place them onto the table. It's fun to read the flavor text on the face-up card aloud when offering to your neighbor. ""We are happy friends"" should help influence their decision, right? The neighbor must choose one to take based upon the information they have available in front of them. This is also a key decision. Will they take the face-up card or go for the unknown in the face-down card? These decisions get harder and harder as the game goes on as players can see what other players are collecting. Once taken, the card's orientation is maintained, but if a face-down card was taken, the owner may now look at it to see what they received. The active player keeps the other card, maintaining its orientation as well. Cards are placed in order of receipt from left to right and must remain in that order for the round. After each player has 4 cards, the round ends and players move into the scoring phase of the game. The Orchid can count as pink, giving a bonus point for the Pink Rose. Face-up cards are considered your Bouquet and remain in place. Face-down cards are considered your Keepsakes. Pull them closer to you, forming a second row but maintaining their order from left to right (and retaining the gaps formed between the Bouquet cards), and reveal them. Cards with abilities trigger in any order that you choose. Using the Snapdragon's ability, I was able to move the Orchid from my bouquet row to my keepsake row. This gives me exactly two cards in the bouquet and an extra 2 points for the Peony. Then score your card abilities from left to right. Each Heart is worth 1 point as well. This example would have been an 8 point round. Not bad! Players then compare total scores. Play to 3 rounds. The winner is the player with the highest combined score from all 3 rounds. You can check out a low color print and play here: https://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/tussie-mussie Tussie Mussie impressed us from the start when it won the 2018 Gen Can't design contest. Since then, it's managed to capture hearts of the review community. Here's a taste of it: ""Tussie-Mussie creates more thoughtful decisions with its ""I cut, you choose"" style and 18 cards than some full-blown tabletop games with five-square-foot player boards and 108 miniatures. It does one thing (card drafting) but does it in a way that creates a light, enjoyable stress for both the cutter and chooser. It is a very good game mechanically."" - http://www.everythingboardgames.com/2019/05/tussie-mussie-kickstarter-preview.html ""In terms of both play and form, Tussie Mussie is New York Slice/Piece o� Cake meets Love Letter. People who enjoy these games will find joy in the language of flowers. Elizabeth Hargrave has another hit on her hands."" - https://boardgamesquad.com/tussie-mussie/ ""Don�t let the name fool you, there is some serious gaming to be found inside this little wallet of a game."" - https://cardboardclash.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/review-for-one-tussie-mussie/ ""This game will never make it to my shelf.

We generally only sell playmats during the Kickstarter campaigns. We'll order a little more than what sells, but the Kickstarter is always the best time to grab one. $72 - US Retailer Level - 12 copies of Tussie Mussie in retail clamshells - delivered in September 2019. This is another level that's good to grab while on Kickstarter, as we dedicate a small portion of the print run to retail store sales. Grabbing them here will guarantee the availability. In previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting this expansion if you pledge here. You are the proud owner of a quaint little neighborhood flower shop. Business has been going so well that it�s time to hire some help. While you�re training your new employee you�ll help to arrange their flowers, but make sure it�s clear who�s in charge! Tussie Mussie: Flower Shoppe is a 6-card expansion that brings solo play to Tussie Mussie! Designed by Mike Mullins (Bottom of the 9th, Pentaquark) this expansion is full of the heart of the multiplayer game, but puts some nice new twists on it for the solo player. Turn Cards direct how cards must be dealt and how they must be taken, but it's up to you to decide which card will go to which player. Do you want to gain some information about that face-down card, or leave it and potentially give your opponent the lead? Want to see how it works? Matt Upton made a lovely walkthrough video: We're also offering a reward level that includes a Solo Playmat. This is not required to play, but makes it look really nice. It's 24"" wide by 14"" tall and helps separate the areas of play as well as keep score. You will need 2 cubes or small tokens to track the scores of yourself and the AI opponent. We have a lot of games in our collection. You can add-on any that are in stock using the below methods. This is our Customer Support Wizard Matthew's collection of our first 42 games.

It was several months later that her game Wingspan (just nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres) burst onto the scene. Beth Sobel is a board game illustrator living in Bellingham, Washington with her husband and two cats. Beth has illustrated our very own Circle The Wagons, along with many other great games such as Viticulture, Wingspan, Arboretum, Between Two Cities and many more. We have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club. It's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects). Our 2019 $5 packages include an episode of Chain Mail, a card and dice driven, asymmetric dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Each episode comes with a postcard map, dual monster card, and a new quest. After multiple months you can randomize these and/or attempt multiple quests in a campaign mode. It also includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Tempus Quest pen and paper game where you use time instead of dice. The crew of the Tempus ship get into a new adventure each month. You can try out the first Episode today right here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/tempus-quest-0-24629368 Our $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. Next month is an Anthelion expansion and a 3 card solo game, MechAge. And our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns.

I'm a 2019 graduate from NYU who's moving to SF and starting a pop-up restaurant for four guests every two weeks in my apartment! This past year has been a crazy ride in terms of cooking for me - I started off taking a food science class in the fall that taught me the fundamentals of cooking. This past semester, I've been hosting 6-8 course tasting menus for four people every two weeks out of my tiny NYC apartment. I've enjoyed the experience a ton and am packing it up to restart it back in San Francisco :) I've prepared dishes ranging from duck/rabbit to caviar/tuna and everything in between and I'm really excited to recreate the menu over this summer for a fall re-launch of the pop-up! A few photos of the dishes that I've been making can be seen below: And a sample menu can be found below as well: This has been a passion project of mine for a while now and I can't wait to start it back up in SF. I'm looking to raise $500 to get this off the ground with new utensils, tools, and plates/bowls as well as experiment with new ingredients over the summer. Anything (even just a dollar) helps and thanks so much for supporting me on this project!"

Pew! Conceptualized and designed by Xin for Book 2, this scepter model was sculpted and textured by Connor and Brendon, who also included the throne of Jetstone and surrounding scene of colored columns, carpeted steps, and grand doorway of the royal palace, as designed by David Hahn for Book 3. They even made it a little tassled pillow, aw... This is just one of many pieces of high quality sculpting they are producing every day. It was not created just to be a Kickstarter reward, but a whole set of environment and object assets that we'll be able to use over and over again to create new comics in Book 5 and beyond.

I am a HUGE dragon fan, so I want to make a HUGE dragon pin! The only problem is, I couldn't decide what color to make it... Based on my previous experience I am pretty confident that Red and Blue are the two most popular colors of dragons (sorry to all you fans of other colors of dragons. It's nothing personal, this is just based on my past projects). Unfortunately the Red/Blue situation is too close to call, so I want to make this design in red AND blue! The Pins Each pin: is Hard Enamel is 2.25 inches tall and 2.25 inches wide has gold colored plating has two post/clutches to hold it securely in place Why are there A-Grade and B-Grade and what is the difference? This refers to the quality grade of the pin. Enamel pins are individually crafted and because of this there is some variation in the quality. A-grade pins have extremely few or no visible flaws. These are the very best of what I have to offer. B-grades have minor flaws that may include over or under filled enamel, small scratches,, wobbly (but secure) back posts, or other similar defects, but they are still beautiful pins! I actually prefer B-grade pins for wearing or putting on my bag, as I don't have to be as concerned about them picking up scratches or getting lost as I go about my day. Some of my KS campaigns, especially smaller ones like this, are really personal projects that I invite others to join me in. This is one of those projects. I want these dragons on my bag, so I am taking a risk on the campaigns success and am having the pins made ahead of a campaign so I can ship quickly. Because of this I have chosen to limit the number of A-grade pins available to make sure that I have enough to quickly fulfill the rewards. About Frost Dragon Designs, LLC My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. I am an artist and seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturing partners. This is my 22nd Kickstarter campaign! I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives. Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!"

We're here with another indie badge for DEF CON this year. You may remember @CromulonB from our Cromulon heads or various SAO holders from years past. We are not associated with DEF CON and this badge won't actually get you into the con but will get you more geek cred once you are on site. We've been a little more industrious over the winter this year and we would humbly like to present the MULTI PASS badge for your consideration and approval. Images not to scale The theme of this years badge is based on one of my favorite movies, The Fifth Element. Of course there is a little DEF CON flare thrown in there but we tried to stay faithful to the original prop. At least as far as we could in PCB form. For instance we were able to read the part number for the LED indicator on the original prop. That component is still in production and you can see we included that on the final badge. The image above is one of the early hand built prototypes so there are a few changes in the final version. Mainly going with a gold process and an added SAO location. The name displayed on the MULTI PASS screen is an option you can change on the badge. Render of final colors When we set out to make this badge one of our main goals was to make a badge that would be useful even after the con. The way we are attempting to make this happen is by making our badge easy to develop for and by being compatible with an existing platform. The badge.team platform supports apps written in python. Python generally has a lower learning curve then most embedded languages. The platform also has a repository with apps written and submitted by others. There is a ton of documentation and example code so getting started is easy. There is even an emulator so you can write apps before you even get the badge. Apps can be installed over USB or downloaded with an included installer while on WiFi. Below is a quick navigation demo. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

This SAO is of course compatible with any other badge with an SAO header. One point has been removed from your license. Secret SAO If we told you any details it wouldn't be a secret. Just know it's on theme and it'll be cool. Half the fun is the other #BadgeLife nerds trying to spot one in the wild. Stretch Goals $12,000 - Generic lanyard becomes a customized lanyard and DC souvenir. Sell Out - For our sanity and safety of our production timelines we aren't going to make a huge amount of badges. If we sell all the badges listed here (Fifth Element Tier not included) a special gift will be included with all the badges. This is in the works and we will give more details if the goal is reached. FAQs Will this badge get me into DEF CON? Nope. We are not associated with DEF CON in any official way. Can I buy a badge and pick it up at DEF CON? Not this time around. Kickstarter has limitations on selecting shipping and with the limited number of badges keeping everything separate would be a pain. Not to mention airport security is already hard enough for me without 100 LiPo batteries. Will these be available in Vegas? We hope to have a limited number on site to be bought, earned, found, etc. Of course the campaign has be successful for that to happen."

I really don't like the fact that the T-shirts are $20, because I'm not trying to make much profit, but after crunching all the numbers, selling at least 50 of these for $20 is the only way I can make some money for the time I've put into it. My goal with this is just to spread the design of the shirt! If people are into the design that's all I really want. The company I'm going through to make these is 4imprint, and they have great reviews in terms of quality of product so I'm confident the shirts will turn out well. If you'd like to support me in this endeavor, pledging $20 can be thought of as a pre-order for the shirt until they're made and ready to be shipped out. I have to stress this though; you will NOT be eligible for a shirt if you pledge under $20. Any pledges under or over $20 will be assumed as general donations to get this project off the ground.

Two years of sharing our innermost feelings, getting real about our personal struggles, and opening mental health conversations through original, insightful, and creative perspectives. To celebrate our anniversary, we�re producing a limited edition collection box. Our four issues�Masculinity, Anger, Workaholism, and Boundaries�in a beautiful letterpress package designed just for you. If you have been reading us for some time and are missing an issue or two, you can now complete the collection and safe keep it for years to come. For new readers, you can begin your Anxy journey with the whole series right from the start. In this campaign, we are also releasing 140 copies of the issue that kicked it all off. Straight from our archives, we are making �The Anger Issue� temporarily available. It�s been sold out for almost a year, but we know it�s the only one some of you are missing! We are proud of what we have accomplished over the past two years and appreciate all the love and immense support. It has exceeded our dreams and expectations. In a short time, over 30,000 people joined our global community of readers, stockists, and admirers. Anxy was also recognized as one of the top 100 organizations leading cultural change by the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. We also graciously accepted two Stack Awards in 2017�Launch of the Year and Subscribers� Choice�and two more in 2018 for Art Director of the Year and Best Use of Illustration. Last month, we spent some time with San Francisco Suicide Prevention for their gala event Laughs for Life where we received the Vanguard Award alongside the Born This Way Foundation and Solomon Thomas from the San Francisco 49ers. To top it all off, The Society of Publication Designers recently selected Anxy for two Silver Awards, recognizing Anxy as one of the world's best editorial design, together with The New York Times Magazine, The California Sunday Magazine, WIRED, and more. Anxy has quickly become a favorite among indie magazine lovers around the world, shortlisted with some of the most established publications, and we couldn�t be more honored to be on this journey together with you. Select the full set, or a combination of issues and the box, to complete your collection. No. 1 � The Anger Issue: We all know anger, but it presents itself in unique ways. Maybe it begins as a nagging irritation and develops into a Hulk-like rage; or perhaps it just eats away at you slowly. We wanted to bring the ever-present, shape-shifting nature of anger to the pages of Anxy. Featured Interview: Margaret Atwood. Explore more > No. 2� The Workaholism Issue: Work isn�t just what we do�it�s who we are. But when does hard work stray into something addictive, controlling, and dangerous? We decided to investigate the realities of work in an issue filled with personal experiences, brave interviews, striking photography, and creative work. Featured Interview: Comedian Neal Brennan. Explore more > No. 3 � The Boundaries Issue: How do our inner worlds define the lines we draw and the space we create? Boundaries shape the way we live, love and work�but what do our boundaries say about who we are underneath? Our third issue looks at personal space from the inside out. Featured Interview: Open Mike Eagle & Fabiola Jean-Louis. Explore more > No. 4 �The Masculinity Issue: What does it mean to be masculine? How does masculinity influence our sense of self and the culture around us? Masculinity isn�t just about men. Masculinity is about everyone�our power, our vulnerability, our self-expression, and our state of mind. Featured Interview: Terry Crews & Karamo Brown.

The Four Elements of Thinking is a book about training your mind to work through problems, decision making, reasoning, spurring creativity, finding insights through synthesis, and learning how to evaluate ideas. You can use the cards as flash cards to learn about the Four Elements of Thinking or to apply the elements of thinking in your everyday life. You will find the cards useful at work and at home. The book associates the Ancient Greek elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire with the key aspects of thinking: Reasoning, Creativity, Synthesis and Evaluation. This mnemonic gets you to apply the key aspects of thinking frequently. You can find out more by previews of the book (available at Amazon) or by visiting my website: http://cheung.interzone.com. Each of the Four Elements is comprised of four Components (see following picture). Each component has Principles which are mental tools and skills. You can read more about me and my bio on my website or at Amazon. The Four Elements of Thinking book (paperback edition): The Four Elements of Thinking (Paperback ed.) This ""elevator pitch"" graphic I created summarizes the Four Elements of Thinking: Each of the four elements of thinking has 4 components The Four Elements of Thinking PLAYING CARDS are a ""standard"" 52-deck of cards (+2 Jokers), that you can use them to play any normal card game, such as Poker, Spades, and Go-Fish. It also serves as a TRAINING/LEARNING DECK to efficiently apply or learn the Four Elements of Thinking. The Cards each describe the Four Elements (Earth thinking, Air thinking, Water thinking, Fire Thinking) and each of their four components. The cards also have some of the component's principles. Because the Four Elements of Thinking book introduced a set of mental tools; you will need practice with these tools. As with any skill, the more you use them the better you get at it. The PLAYING CARDS are meant to be flash cards that allow you to reinforce the skills described in the principles. The cards can be also used to help you learn more about the four elements, they can be used as a refresher, and also can enhance your training as you practice. They can also be used to help you efficiently apply the Four elements of Thinking because the use of the components and principles can be applied at different points throughout the thinking process. One of the two ""jokers"" in the Deck is a complete summary of the Four Elements of Thinking; and the other joker is the PROBLEM SOLVING Flow using the Four Elements of Thinking (from Chapter 32). The Four Elements of Thinking playing cards IN HAND: I have made a ""batch"" of The Four Elements of Thinking playing cards. So they are IN-HAND, and READY TO SHIP! These are Custom-printed, premium 300gsm cards with a smooth, air-cushion finish. The Four Elements of Thinking Playing Cards ready to ship PLEDGE LEVELS: The various Pledge Levels let you get the PLAYING CARDS (exclusive to kickstarter) and discounted copies of my book (compared to the retail Amazon price). My book will be autographed by me (unique to kickstarter). By default, books you get from this kickstarter will be autographed by me, and you can also specify what you'd like me to write or you can choose to have no autograph too. Note: that I do ship world-wide, but due to the weight of the book, shipping costs internationally can be pretty high. It is probably less expensive for you to buy the book directly from the international Amazon websites. Contact me and I can assist you."

The song is called ""This Love"" and it tells my story going from age 12 to now, from wondering if I was gay to sharing life with my partner, and the rainbow love that was there in my heart the whole time, through all the crying and all the joy. Me around 12, omg what a journey ahead of me... the fear of hell, of not being accepted into Heaven because I had this terrible sin that was a deep part of who I was. On top of a mountain in Austria My boyfriend and I in our early years :) Going against all the authority figures in my life, and taking a step into my heart, into this love. Aww so young and serious After so many years of dreaming about it, moving to the west coast together and feeling a bit like Heaven on Earth. SO glad I listened to my heart and not my fears. On our move to LA last year, living our dreams! I sang the song for the first time at church on Sunday and received such a great response and several tears, it was really encouraging and makes me want to share it more widely. This is kinda new territory for me, most of my songs are super esoteric and this one is a bit more relatable I think (especially for gays). First Unitarian of LA on Instagram: ""Thanks to @masonofma for sharing an original song at today's special LGBTQ+ Pride Service. #happypride #unitarianuniversalist"" A great producer in Nashville reached out, who can work with me remotely and turn it into a nice power pop ballad, and I can record the vocals here with a friend. So I'm all set, just need YOU! Thank you for helping get this song out there!!!"

The results are stunning. Close to our hearts are the intimate interviews with astronauts, scientists, and the people sending missions to space; as well as artists, musicians and philosophers who are inspired by these events.

The traveling crew: Pup Tuck, Ryan Chylinski, and MaryLiz Bender Ryan and MaryLiz at NASA Kennedy Space Center MaryLiz Bender is a space artist and live show producer who brings together communities of artists, scientists, and philosophers to tell powerful stories and create transformative experiences. She spent several years as a touring musician, learning how impactful it is to meet communities where they are. This inspired her to take the Cosmic Perspective on tour, building a network of people along the way that work to elevate empathy in their own communities. In 2017, she sold her house, her possessions and hit the road full-time in her mobile observatory. Persevering through poverty, addiction, and depression, she knows the importance in pursuing meaningful work, linking positive people together, and the life transformations that can result from focused inner-work. Cosmic Perspective is her mission to help others pursue a meaningful life. MaryLiz interviewing Michelle Thaller at the NASA ICESAT-2 launch Ryan Chylinski is a cinematographer who has spent the past several years working with altered perception photography to tell stories like they�ve never been told before. His mission documenting rocket launches, and the science and people behind them, has been featured on the cover of magazines, news sites, and premiered on networks including the Discovery Channel and A24 studios. SpaceX Falcon Heavy photograph featured on the cover of Ad Astra magazine We filmed exclusively for A24 and Supercluster during the Falcon Heavy Arabsat-6A launch.

We hadn't met yet, but in 2017, we both sold everything�our homes and possessions�and we took to the road full-time to research a phenomenon. The research tugged us both to NASA Kennedy Space Center where we met just after a rocket launch. We fell madly in love and began our journey together. While traveling together full-time for the last year, we've shared moments of awe that have changed our lives and shaped who we are today. We can't help but share them with the world.

Building on the success of our first Kickstarter picture book Sleep, Acroterion Books presents our plan for Leonardo Dreams of his Flying Machine! To celebrate the 500th anniversary of the life and creative accomplishments of this great Renaissance master, artist Anne Horjus has created a series of wondrous oil paintings to tell the visual story of the libretto written by Charles Anthony Silvestri for the choral masterpiece of the same name by composer Eric Whitacre. Choirs and audiences all over the world have thrilled to the soaring and ethereal harmonies of Whitacre's setting, and now you can experience Leonardo's daring leap in a whole new way! Here is one of the many fine performances of Whitacre's Leonardo Dreams of his Flying Machine, by the VocalEssence Ensemble Singers and conducted by Eric Whitacre himself. Anne's paintings for the book are based on many original works by Leonardo, adapted to fit the story of the text. His illustrations all fit together in an ingenious series of interlocking compositional layers, worthy of Leonardo's cleverness, with each painting flowing seamlessly into the next, sharing a compositional structure all based on the face of Leonardo as he dreams of flight. We have added new text as well, introducing you to Leonardo himself, his life and work, his methods and techniques, and his musings on the future of flight. Your amazing stretch goal support for our Sleep project enabled Anne to create these remarkable paintings. Now with your help we can raise the funds necessary to print Leonardo Dreams Of His Flying Machine with the same quality and care, and share it with the world! With your support as a generous backer of this campaign you will enable us to print Leonardo at Worzalla Press in Wisconsin, just as we did Sleep, so the same deluxe quality, feel, and weight that folks have loved about Sleep will be duplicated with this book. Your support also enables us to create a full print run of 3000 books, so that Leonardo can take his place alongside his sister, Sleep, at bookstores and on Amazon for years to come. Like Sleep, Leonardo Dreams Of His Flying Machine combines a well-known choral work with a picture book, enabling interdisciplinary learning in Music, Language Arts, and History classrooms. But we suspect that our most enthusiastic backers will be choir geeks like ourselves! If you have sung Leonardo, let us know! We thank you for your consideration, and for your backing yet another exciting project! We look forward to rewarding you for your support, and we won't let you down!

Set in a land nearby but a time long ago, it tells the epic tale of our left and right-leaning ancestors who must overcome their differences in order to save their shared home. With Dr. Suess style rhymes, beautiful illustrations, and a comical but timely metaphor, Two Tribes is for kids and adults alike. What people are saying... Know someone else that would love Two Tribes? Want to be part of the movement that fixes our polarizing politics? Let your friends know about Two Tribes. About the author Hello! I'm Tyler. Two Tribes is my first book, and was written on a spark of inspiration (more on that later). I currently work in business operations, before that I volunteered full time in Nepal and Louisiana, and before that I worked for a healthcare software company. In case you were wondering, I don't identify with any political party. Where I'm coming from: I grew up in a conservative family, attended liberal schools, and have friends on both sides of the aisle. As someone with ties to people on both sides, I am really worried about the spread of tribalism and political extremism in America. I have watched good people become hateful and divisive, and seen families torn apart by differences in political opinions. I have met intelligent people who have lost faith in truth and reason, and heard normally kind individuals spew hateful insults. I'm guessing you've seen it too. Who is the illustrator? Two Tribes was illustrated by Rachel Beenken. To see more of her amazing work or to get in touch, check out her website: www.rachelbeenken.com Inspiration! The story of Two Tribes was inspired by a conversation I had with my dad. We were talking about a political issue, and after initially agreeing on most things, we started arguing because of a small difference in opinion. He saw things one way and I saw them another. We stopped listening to each other and instead tried to prove we were right. This only made it worse. We fixed nothing and strained our relationship, and we were further apart than when we had started. It seemed to me this was a microcosm of what was happening in politics in general, and I knew we weren't the only people having useless arguments. As a country we are stuck in a tug of war with each other, neither side willing to give an inch to gain a mile. This experience sparked the idea of Two Tribes. I imagined two groups of people, who because of a slight difference between them, struggle to address an issue that threatens them all. Although Two Tribes is a children's book, I hope it will be appreciated by kids and adults of all ages and political backgrounds. Find the reward that's right for you! Why I'm raising money Making and printing a book is surprisingly expensive. I'm raising money to cover the costs of the first print run. Thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours have already gone into the creation of Two Tribes. Without much of a budget left, this Kickstarter will ensure that I can print the first physical copies and make the book available for purchase. 1st print run: $7,500 You mentioned 'political polarization'...what is that? In short, political polarization is when people sort themselves into political groups that become increasing hostile towards one another and more extreme and certain in their opinions or ideology. The Pew Research Center says that ""Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines � and partisan acrimony is deeper and more extensive � than at any point in recent history."" Why should you care? In a recent study, over 40% of participants in each political party said they view the other party as ""downright evil."" This would indicate almost 50 million voters in America believe that people on the other side are inherently evil, not just misinformed or of a different opinion. Additionally, nearly 1 in 5 participants agreed with the question: ""Do you ever think we'd be better off as a country if large numbers of the opposing party in the public today just died?"" Americans no longer simply disagree with one another. They hate, fear, and are unwilling to work with people they disagree with. This is bad for the country and sets a terrible example for the next generation of voters. Worse, it sets the grounds for politically motivated violence and gives power to the extreme ends of the political spectrum. Polarization is a threat to everyone - left and right leaning alike.

Annabel features female, LGBTQ+, and POC characters and relationships. Here's a synopsis! Annabel Stevens, Walking Disaster�, is in trouble. Her sister wants her to find love, her mother wants her to find her dreams, her best friends want her to find her humanity - but she just wants to sit, eat a lot of cheese balls and make rent.

Have you ever become pleasantly zoned out while watching Bob Ross or listening to someone tap their nails? If so, then you've probably experienced ASMR. ASMR (or autonomous sensory meridian response) is a deeply relaxing experience in which certain sounds trigger a tingly feeling in your body. People describe it as chill, blissful, even euphoric�and it can be brought on by something as simple as listening to someone brush their hair, whisper, or crinkle paper. It may sound a little out there, but it's hugely popular. (Perhaps you've read about how Cardi B's a fan or seen the ASMR commercial featuring Zo� Kravitz?) Whether you're a longtime ASMR enthusiast or just curious, we have a first of its kind product that we think you'll love. Experience ASMR Like Never Before It's called SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition, and it's the first headphones to come preloaded with ASMR content. (Eight hours, in fact!) And these aren't just any headphones�they're SleepPhones�, the world's most comfortable headphones for sleeping and relaxing. SleepPhones� feature flat speakers in a soft, stretchy headband. They also contain a thin, flexible module with a button that lets you play, pause, skip tracks, and control the volume. With SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition, there's no external device or cords�just simple headphones that can play for 20 hours from a three-hour charge. You'll love the superior sound quality from the eco-friendly, lead-free speakers. Ditto for the comfortable headband made from our proprietary SheepCloud� fabric. Our headbands are machine washable and come in two fabrics: warm Fleece and moisture-wicking Breeze. You can also choose from three sizes and lots of great colors! Get Ready to Tingle We worked with 16 top ASMRtists from all over the world to create the preloaded recordings for SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition. You'll enjoy everything from rhythmic tapping to light scratching to peaceful Italian whisperings. And you'll enjoy lots of it because these artists have recorded 8 hours of deeply relaxing ASMR content for your listening pleasure! Imagine slipping a soft, pliable headband over your ears. A small button in the back of the headband cues hours of ASMR to start playing. This button also lets you adjust the volume and skip tracks. There are no ads, no blue light from a device, and no scrolling�just a whole lot of incredibly relaxing ASMR ready for you to enjoy. Unwind with These ASMRtists We spent many months gathering just the right mix of ASMRtists for this special project. We're proud to include the following 16 ASMRtists on SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition. Collectively, they have 2.4 million YouTube subscribers!

As a self-funded, inventory-based business, we must put forth a substantial level of investment to design, manufacture, ship, and store a new product. Any amount you pledge will help us get one step closer to making SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition a reality! Here's a timeline of what's been done so far�and what you can expect when you back this one-of-a-kind Kickstarter campaign: A Bit More About Us Our company is called AcousticSheep LLC, and we're the inventors of SleepPhones�, the world's first and most comfortable headphones for sleeping. They say necessity is the mother of invention, and that was certainly the case when it came to SleepPhones�. After taking patient phone calls late into the night, Dr. Wei-Shin Lai wanted to listen to relaxing music in bed. But only bulky headphones or uncomfortable earbuds were on the market. So she and her husband decided to design comfortable headband headphones you can wear in bed�even if you sleep on your side. SleepPhones� feature wafer-thin speakers in a super soft headband so anyone can easily and comfortably listen to music, audio books, meditation tracks, and more in bed. Since 2007, our company has sold more than one million SleepPhones� and won many awards for our patented invention. Beyond helping people sleep and relax, SleepPhones� became very popular within the ASMR community. Some of the top ASMR YouTube artists have promoted our products to their millions of followers for years. That got us thinking: Why not marry SleepPhones� award-winning design with great ASMR content? Soon, that will be a reality with SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition. Our 2015 Kickstarter campaign for our SleepPhones� Effortless� exceeded its goal by 656%, and we hope this project will, too. Thank you for supporting SleepPhones�: ASMR Edition!"

It is a story with no real plot...all you needed to know was that Randy was coming and Jimmy Crumpet had to stop him. Along the way Jimmy Crumpet (Humphrey) had met many characters. Manticore (Drew), Dances with Squirrels (Gerald), Randy (Alex), and Randy's Evil Henchman (Hunter and Thomas), and even a Cameo from Nana, Kim, Copeland. This project we made was almost forgotten but we have revisited the source material and decided to bring the film back. We are now capable of so much more and want to make a six year old film into a new age. Some Characters can't return, and some others may not. But for the ones who can't return we plan to make this film in a way that would make them happy and make them laugh. The budget for the film that we have set is to cover the costs of the costumes and other expenses, since we plan to take this a bit more serious. I can't afford to make this investment on my own and I am mostly asking family and those involved in the film to contribute. Thank you so much and we hope to be able to create something that would not only be our proudest work, but also something to represent the creative, crazy, and unique nature of our family."

Characters can migrate freely between the two games, although distance and movement rules are different between the two games. Do I need Battlestations? No, DIRTSIDE is ready to go out of the box. You can play fully cooperatively against the game, or one player can act as the game master for a classic Battlestations RPG experience. Battlestations and Dirtside are cross-compatible, so you can play your characters and minis from one game in the other game! You don�t need to know all the rules before starting a mission for either game, just the basics and the rules for your character and your equipment. You can look up anything else you need later. Dirtside takes place primarily on the surface of planets. Each planet is different. There's several vehicles to drive around in, and they all have different features. Parachute in, or ride in a boarding missile. Dirtside's world exists in 3 dimensions. You'll have to work together to take down a Vraktian Behemoth! The bigger they are, the harder they fall! Cannon Installation - a small pillbox-like building with a ship-cannon sized gun in multimode. Battlestations Second Edition is based on the same game system as Dirtside. Battlestations is a tabletop starship simulator � a multi-map board game that simultaneously features ship-action in space AND the events on board the ships involved in the conflicts. It is also a roleplaying game in which your characters grow throughout campaigns, picking up experience points, upgrades, and new abilities. You are simultaneously moving your minis around your starship boards (to activate battle stations or fight off boarding pirates)� AND flying your ship mini around on the separate space map, dodging asteroids and launching missiles. Ultra simple rules so anyone can join the game - simply move and take an action, or else take an action and then move. Ultra quick turn actions so players get to take twice as many actions per mission as similar games like Imperial Assault True sense of camaraderie as nearly all missions are fully cooperative Unique missions (puzzle solving, combat, navigation hazards, etc), including missions by guest designers We've been building this incredible game nearly 20 years. Now we're taking it to the next level - DIRTSIDE, a brand new standalone game that is fully cooperative, so you don't need a game master. Plus it can be played completely solo, or played 1 vs 1, as a miniatures skirmish game. Packages will ship to most countries from within those countries.

This board game involves more than dangerous paths and chance encounters; it also demands a careful use of food and water. No food -- your team can't move. No water -- your team dies. In other words -- logistics, in the form of food, water, and trade goods tokens your team needs to ration until you can find, trade, or steal for more along the way. A perfect 1 - 2 player board game with entertaining escapism. For those seeing this for the first time, here's the introduction to the game (if you've already saw this last time, scroll past it): Somewhere on a mountain top, an airplane crashes. Are there any survivors? No one knows, and very few care. Why? Because there was gold on board that plane. Your mission is to take your team (starting with six members) to the top of the mountain and bring back the gold, and if you come back empty-handed, your backers will make you wish you never did. Sounds easy? Don't even think it! For starters, you may have another team trying to beat you to the treasure. Then, near the top, there's the chance for avalanches that will bury you faster than you can take a breath. And what about that rickety old bridge you may have to cross? Will your steps be the ones that will take it -- and you -- to the bottom of the ravine? And then there are villagers. Friendly you think? Maybe yes; maybe no. Entering a village can result in anything to from celebrations or normal trade to mysterious diseases or even a personal invitation to dinner from a bunch of cannibals! Some paths are easier than others -- maybe. One leads to a vast thicket patch that may take an eternity as you aimlessly cut your way through. Another leads through a desolate mountain path completely devoid of water. Let's say you're lucky. Very lucky. Let's say there's no avalanches, broken bridges, or even bad village encounters. You're not out of danger yet. Not by a long shot. There's the little matter of food and water to consider. Because the journey is strenuous, you need food and lots of it! And water? Well, let's just say you simply can't live without it! You must manage your team's food and water as though your lives depended upon it, because it does. Without food, your team cannot move; without water, your team dies. Will you have enough food and water for the journey to the gold and back? That's up to you, and luck. Along the way, you will run low on both, but you will have opportunities to get both from villages -- if they're friendly and free of disease -- and you'll have ample free water in the snow capped regions of the mountains -- if you get that far. Your team can leave supplies behind along the way for later, but be sure the team picking it up again is your team. Feel free to trade with the competing team, but keep in mind that if your team is smaller than theirs, they can take all they can carry of yours and leave you stranded. So, are you up to the challenge? Can you handle the tedious, but life-sustaining, task of keeping your people supplied while you press on for the gold? Are you willing to accept the inevitable loss of team members and face the disappointment that, one by one, your team gets smaller and smaller? Can you keep your head and not panic when the food and water runs low? Are you willing to sacrifice all for the gold? If so, back this game for a board game that will give you the time of your life! PRODUCT SPECIFICS (comparing the new manufactured to the old PnP ): 1. The printed 5 pages of Rules are now in a convenient booklet: 2. The flimsy paper game board is now a sturdy quad-fold: 3. No more hunting down suitable dice; all properly colored & sized dice included: 4. Thicker pieces make for easier manipulation on the game board, as well as being less likely to get bent: 5. Lastly, uniform pressing of all pieces ensure a smart look and don't have imperfect cuts that might hint at what message is on the opposite side (for Village, Bridge, and Avalanche pieces):"

They will perform alongside other young artists in training in an off-Broadway youth showcase hosted by New Jersey's Professional Performance Prep. All four of the young performers making the trip have been a prominent part of our Main Stage company over the past 5 years. You've seen them The Secret Garden, Annie, Mary Poppins, Oliver, and this summer, Matilda! Our young performers are serious about their craft, and their training. In addition to performing for the community they take weekly voice and dance lessons, perform with Main Stage's children's company, and several also play instruments. The girls will be performing a tribute their home theater and community. A selection of ""Our Favorite Things"" - a medley of songs from Main Stage shows past, present, and future. We are passionate about supporting these young artists in taking on this exciting opportunity and further pursuing their artistic goals. Creating opportunities for young performers is a part of the foundation of our organization.

Help me cover the production costs and I'll send you a physical copy! You can choose between CD, vinyl, or cassette tape. I started writing songs in high school. I would sit with my guitar for hours and hours, painstakingly crafting miserable little pieces of poetry and putting them to music. Nothing has changed since then in that regard, but I did eventually graduate high school and went on to study music theory. When I was 20 I began teaching a songwriting class at Camp Winnarainbow. Kids ages 7 to 14 would come write weird songs in the woods and perform them for their parents after two weeks. The most popular topics kids choose to write songs about are 1) ex-boyfiends, 2) food, and 3) dinosaurs. Check out this classic. This album is all the songs I wrote in my twenties that I still enjoy playing. Some were written a decade ago; some I wrote this year. You'll notice they all have nice major chords and rhyming lyrics. Thanks for your support! -Jordan"

We're not talking about the big, brightly-lit stores like Blockbuster, either. We mean the hole-in-the-wall shops, where you could find some deep dive horror movies. Well, welcome to Video Hell. Lunchbox Press proudly presents Graveyard Slaughter. Lunchbox Press invites you back to those video stores of old. This collection of four horror epics is written by Cullen Bunn and Kevin Watkins. The stories are illustrated by a host of amazing talent, including Javier Saltares, Blacky Shepherd, Gary Bedell, and Adam McLaughlin. We are also pleased to have award-winning and best-selling author, Paul Tremblay, providing an introduction to our premiere issue. The stories in this comic harken back to the dark, bloody, subversive horror yarns that sat in clamshell boxes on video stores shelves across the country. They�re gruesome and gory and fun horror tales, and we're all psyched to be part of the book. Once funded...we plan on delivering you the book by Halloween 2019. Be kind. Rewind. Or die.

It�s truly an enjoyable read for anyone that loves the camp, gore, and horror that the 1980s did so well."" -Monkeys Fighting Robots ""It�s hard not to love this book. Graveyard Slaughter #1 embraces the off the wall mania of the VHS horror section."" -But Why Tho? ""Stories of the lunatic in the woods, the teens drinking and partying, or the game of hide and seek in the graveyard are all tropes that have been used often. It is the execution of these stories and, in some, the ending that keeps you engaged in Graveyard Slaughter."" -DIS/MEMBER ""Graveyard Slaughter is dripping with '80s nostalgia and covered in blood...all of the stories feel like they were pulled right from my childhood."" -Horror DNA Promotional ad by Gary Bedell The Graveyard Slaughter Super Group...from left to right...Javier Saltares, Gary Bedell, Cullen Bunn, Kevin Watkins, Blacky Shepherd, Adam McLaughlin At over 50 pages, the first issue is done.

In Pussycats: Eat Death, Or Get Naked #1 Cowgirl Cathy and Schoolgirl Suzie think that they're dead. Why wouldn't they? They're on a UFO. Which don't exist. Right? Wrong. Mother Superior chooses space and its silence because her disinformation campaign has done little to turn the odds in her favor. She is still wanted by the U.S. government, her Pussycats are still hunted, and there is nowhere to hide from the men that want them eliminated. This new mini-series will be available in comic shops starting this September � running through December � and you'll see it advertised with the ad slick below featured in the July 2019 PREVIEWS comic shop catalog. NOTE: There are no immediate plans to issue a TP of this series after it concludes. The earliest a TP will be issued will be in fall 2020. However...first stop....Kickstarter! That's right, we're back here first to kick things off like we always do, and this Kickstarter's going to be our biggest to date because we have superstars Tori Duke and Sarah Shellhorn as our cover models throughout the entire series!

Courtesy of Todd Mulrooney, here is a YouTube interview that Vince and Tori Duke did on May 30, talking with Chester C Busby III. Learn about the origin of the series, and how the models are an integral part of the Pussycats comic book! PREVIEWSworld has already jumped on this book prior to its release, and their article can be read here. We are also honored to have been featured in an interview by Chris Braly on Bleeding Fool's Indie Showcase! This site is top notch in that they don't bend at the knee for those who are ""woke."" Check out the interview by clicking on the image below, or by clicking on the link here. For those of you new to Pussycats, in Volumes 1-2 the gun-toting nun Mother Superior has been targeted for elimination in an election year because of her past ties to covert operations during the Cold War. The knowledge that she and her former colleagues possess makes them liabilities. To protect herself, the woman of God goes underground, publishes the names of her former superiors, and recruits the few women she trusts � her �Pussycats� � to help her save members of her former military unit. Her last attempt to cheat death is to leave Earth with the Pussycats in transportation that�s not forged by human hands, or terrestrial technology. Volume 3 reveals how the Pussycats legacy extends to paramilitary lovers Viper and Foxglove. These lesbian lovers try to expose Earth�s zombie plague as an intentional act of genocide by the same people who tried to eliminate the Pussycats. Through classified documents, they learn that decades earlier Mother Superior had tried to stop the plague and other acts of subterfuge from their nation�s leaders, but all of her efforts ended in failure. To see the past 3 storylines at a glance, check out the .pdf previews of the previous trade paperbacks here: Volume 1 TP Volume 2 TP This new series ties together the events shown in Sex, Drugs & The Impossible and The End Of Everything. Present and future events collide in a Eat Death, Or Get Naked, revealing the repercussions of Mother Superior�s unilateral actions. A woman of God is about to feel the wrath of Heaven. The big question is who else becomes collateral damage? Check out some of the new book's interior pages below, and then we'll sum things up, and get to the goodie bags! Check out this preview of issue #1, which is raw meth mixed with adrenaline. Pussycats: Eat Death, Or Get Naked is for Mature Readers, and contains sex, nudity, graphic violence, and foul language.

Check out Tori Duke and Sarah Shellhorn embracing the love and camaraderie of Cowgirl Cathy and Schoolgirl Suzie! Our goal is to offset the cost of printing this book. That's it. The book is done. It will ship on time. Guaranteed. Anyone who's supported this book in the past can tell you that we always deliver. We're able to do a series a year because Kickstarter keeps us in the black.

The Elemental Balance is a story about 4 individuals from around the world who gain the powers of the Elements. They are known as the Elementals. They don�t know how or why they got these powers, but they all diedfrom a natural disaster caused by the Element's energy they harness. The story follows their journey of finding one another in hopes of unraveling the truth behind their powers and its connection to their resurrection. Instead, they discover that they're being hunted by a mysterious force! The story has been written by Zain Shenwari with artwork done by Luke Horsman. This is our 2nd project on Kickstarter and we're really excited to present this to everyone. Project Status: All of the artwork, coloring and lettering have been completed . We'll be ready to mail out the printed comics as soon as the campaign is over. All we need now is your support to help fund the prints for Chapter 4! So...What's the Story Like? If you've enjoyed shows like NBC's ""Heroes"" and Netflix's show ""Sense8"" then you would definitely enjoy The Elemental Balance. ELEMENTAL BALANCE CH 4 | FIRED UP They say LOVE is like FIRE because when you're in love the heart ignites. But when the heart breaks, it burns! Chapter 4 of the Elemental Balance takes us to the other side of the world to Chile, South America. A country known for its dense population of volcanoes, surrounding its border by the ring of fire. A suitable birthplace for the Fire Elemental. Adriana and Lucia have been best friends since childhood but they're polar opposites of one another. Adriana prides herself in being good, while Lucia could care less about her image. Growing up, their parents nicked name them ""Angelita y Diablita"" or translated in English as ""little Angel & little Devil"". After one of them goes through a heartbreak , the other helps by suggesting going on a hiking trip up a volcano. What could possibly go wrong? Discover the secrets revealed at the pinnacle of a Volcano in Chapter 4, Fired Up.

It�s well-written, with just enough suspense to have a thrill for your experience."" Steven Leitman from ""Reading with a Flight Ring"". Click here for the full review. Part of the joy of reviewing books is when people send me their books and I have no idea who they are or what they do. It is that surprise moment when you feel like you�ve discovered something fantastic. This is the kind of book I tell you about and seek folks this out at conventions. Mike from ""Chico Comics Page"". Click here for the full review. ""In comics there are indie publishers, and then there are indie publishers. There was confidence in the writing, the art, and overall design of the book. The art in here is fantastic. Everything feels like a comic I should be reading off the stands."" Trever from ""Frags and Beer"". Click here for the full review. ""I enjoyed every panel of this book, and hope to see a lot more from Luke. The pages have a lot of movement and detail. The characters look great against wonderful backgrounds. The pencils are up there with the best that I�ve seen from any company, large or indie. This book is definitely worth checking out."" ABOUT ME: Hi, my name is Zain and I�m the writer for The Elemental Balance. I�ve always had a passion for writing stories. In fact, my first story �Game Plan� was written to impress my wife. Spoiler alert, it paid off! I find it rewarding to bring entertainment to people, that�s my niche! My style of storytelling is grounded in reality but, nonetheless, is fiction. Characters are set in unrealistic situations but have very relatable emotions. Imagine if someone could achieve greatness with a determined will, how would they react if they had powers? This is what my stories are rooted in�.emotions! Zain Shenwari - Writer/Creator ABOUT THE ARTIST: Luke Horsman is an extremely talented artist from the UK. He is well versed in many forms of art mediums. In fact, Luke did the pencils, ink, and coloring for the first three chapters. His artwork has truly brought the characters from the script to life. Luke Horsman - Penciler/Inker/Colorist It's been a blast working with him. We mesh really well. I'm particular with scenes and visual symbolism and he's keen on creating eye-catching, bold illustrations. Together we made an excellent team!

From ride share services, on demand food delivery, dry cleaning, errands, etc. It was only a matter of time before the convenience store became even more convenient. With a fast download from the app store, you can have practically any convenience store items delivered to you. From the concept of what you want from a delivery type service we kept all the good and removed all those annoying things such as ""hidden fees"" ""service fees"" ""surcharges"" and ""minimum order requirements"" to keep things simple. With a flat rate, affordable delivery fee, no minimum order requirements, and customer service that will make you feel like our best friend, We can promise you will love this service! The goal of this project is to raise the necessary funds to expand into multiple cities, add additional products and services within the Munchez Business, all that has been asked by current and future customers. With over 140 app downloads in the first 30 Days of launch, which included created accounts from 18 Cities in 10 States outside of our current market, We see not only a want but a need that other delivery and on demand services have yet to fill or simply won't."

Currently, solutions for affordable resin printing require either experience or research to get started. Our goal was to make using a resin 3D Printer easy and affordable. The Prism The Prism is the result of thousands of hours of use and development. The Prism removes a number of barriers through a combination of hardware and unique software features, making it approachable for non-super users. Hardware With an easy to remove magnetic bed and a print volume of 120mm x 70mm x 150mm, the Prism is a resin printer with a 2K LCD screen that allows for high resolution prints that look like finished products. Built with an all metal chassis for durability and a dual linear rail motion system for stability, prints can be as fine as 25 micron. The 57 watt parallel LED array drives uniform light distribution across the entire build plate, edge to edge. Hardware Features Auto Leveling Auto leveling in its purest form. The leveling system actions at the beginning of every print and when homing the machine. Instead of chasing your tail around leveling and running test prints to make sure the level is right, let the machine take care of that process. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Dual Linear Rails - Reliable and repeatable Z movement is essential for high quality printing. 2K LCD Screen - The 2K LCD screen allows for high quality printing. All Metal - The all metal frame provides a rigid structure for daily operation. Fully enclosed with convenient flip lid. Parallel LED Array - The 57 Watt Parallel LED Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area. The 57 Watt Parallel UV Light Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area Software Regardless of the material, the resin calibration gives a strong start on cure times without guessing. The auto leveling system allows for beginners and experts to just print. On the fly cure time adjustment prevents the need to alter your workflow. Finally, we provide support for all major slicers. Software Features Resin Calibration Print Not sure what cure time to set for new resin? No problem. Avoid guess and check by using the built-in resin calibration print. This print provides a reasonable ballpark on what cure time to set for the resin being used -- getting you from guessing to printing faster. Just choose the column that shows the best results! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 On-the-fly Cure Time Adjustment Avoid nuisance around cure time while you are printing. Being able to adjust the cure time on the fly can save a number of pains like needing to reslice the file just to adjust cure time, or fine tune your cure time for a resin. Don't reslice, just print and adjust. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 WiFi Support The Prism has a WebUI that functions as a convenient WiFi based delivery device for sliced files. In addition to delivering files, you are able to: start, stop, pause, edit profiles, and adjust printer settings. Current WebUI interface. Naturally, feel free to transfer files via Micro SD card if preferred! Full Control of Machine Settings Anti Aliasing levels (0,2,4,8x), Movement speed, UV Power Intensity Allowing full control over machine settings is useful to power users and casual users alike. Want to cure a layer faster? Increase the power. Want to use a thicker resin? Adjust the Z speed and distance. Want to smooth out that lower resolution model? Enable anti-aliasing. Take advantage of more settings that many printers lock out. Keep the advanced settings from ChiTuBox intact, including Anti-Aliasing and Power Management Software Compatibility The Prism supports all major slicers, and will continue to be updated as the software for SLA printing evolves. We hope that this lets you choose the software YOU like instead of forcing a buggy difficult-to-use slicer with limited features. Currently, it supports files from ChiTuBox, Slic3r, Print Studio, and Creation Workshop. Print Gallery Here is the Prism in action: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Stretch Goals: Timeline and milestones: May 22nd - Beam3d launches Kickstarter campaign June 22nd - Beam3d Kickstarter campaign ends June 28th - Production of units start July 20th - units are ready to ship and start shipping The Beam Team The Beam3D Team is composed of professionals who have been involved in consumer electronics for the majority of our careers. At our core, we are 3D printing guys, each with our own stable of 3D printers. In fact, a number of those printers are pieces that we have either developed or used in professional ventures throughout our careers from homebrew kits, entry level consumer models, and even up to industrial grade machines. We see the need for high quality, low cost resin printers in the community, and we would like to be the ones to deliver on and support that dream. The Iterations The Prism has gone through a number of iterations. Below are some of the different phases that the Prism has gone through. One of our earliest prototypes.

You can also follow us on Twitter and Instagram and keep an eye on our Updates Page. Thank you everyone!! As of 7/9/19 our Pixel Pride Kickstarter has reached 100% of it's funding goal! We want to thank each and every backer, all the supporters that have shared our campaign, and all our friends that have helped us immensely along the way! We couldn't have done this without you!!!! Introducing Pixel Pride, a collection of LGBTQ+ pride pants and skirts (with pockets!) to fit a variety of different identities and a wide range of body types! Pride month is all about expressing your identity to the world, and clothing is a great way to do that! While there's plenty of great pride gear for your torso, we want to provide something comfortable, functional, and fun for your leggies as well. Our goal with the Pixel Pride line is to create casual clothing that fits more easily into everyday wear than standard flag stripes, while still being a recognizable way to show that you're proud of who you are. June is Pride month, but your identity remains the same year round. We wanted to create a line of clothing to help you show your pride whether you're marching in a parade or shopping for groceries. Humans don't come in only one size, and clothing shouldn't either. So we have a range of sizes available to choose from. All of our clothing has stretchy elastic waistbands, so check out our sizing info to find out the right fit for you! All unlocked designs will be available in all of the sizes shown below. Click the image to go to our detailed size charts with measurements! You can check out our more detailed size charts with measurements, and also see the different sizes on a range of models at this link: Size Charts & Model Gallery Pockets! We know all too well the struggle of wanting to wear something cute and having nowhere to put your phone and wallet. That�s why we include pockets on all of our jogger pants AND skirts! And we don�t skimp on the size, either. Cell phones keep getting bigger, and we make our pockets deep enough to hold them. What is Fresh Hot Flavors? Fresh Hot Flavors is an artist studio run by three queer women (and two fry dragons) living in Dallas, Texas. We all met during college and got our start selling our artistic wares separately at anime, gaming, and otherwise geeky conventions all over the US. In 2017, we decided to join forces to sell our designs on apparel and accessories online and at conventions. You can check out our online store filled with other clothing and accessories we designed at freshhotflavors.com! Goals Our main campaign's goal is to get skirts and pants made for six different identities: gay rainbow, transgender, asexual, bisexual, nonbinary, and pansexual.

We know from experience how difficult it can be to find merchandise for specific identities, and how exciting it is when you find something that represents you. We wanted to put out a line of pants and skirts to accommodate a variety of identities. Producing clothing is a costly process, and we couldn't fund stock of this many different designs without your help! If funded, will these products be exclusive to Kickstarter? Nope! Our goal with this campaign is to fund a line of clothing accessible to as many people as we can. We don't want anyone to miss out, so all of the items that become available through this Kickstarter will be for sale on our online store and at conventions after the campaign is over as well. Getting in at the beginning with our Kickstarter will allow you to be the very first to grab these designs, as well as help us fund even more designs and get some freebies if we unlock stretch goals!"

These four songs form a loose concept EP as described in the video. The use of the words ""past life"" can be interpreted in whichever way you see fit, whether it relates to your belief in our having lived different lives prior to this one, or whether it makes you reminisce on who you were in the past of this life. Over a year ago I released three singles that I love dearly. This EP would be what I consider as my first multiple-song release. If you have any of the ""albums"" that I released in high school, I ask that you do us all a favor and destroy them to protect future generations. I live in fear that one day I will sit across from Jimmy Fallon and he will have dredged up some embarrassing artistic venture from my youth, but if you wish to see me embarrassed on national television, that may be extra incentive to help me fund this project! The first memory I have of songwriting occurred when I was around four or five years old. I distinctly remember lying in bed and composing a kitschy ""rock & roll"" song about a literal rock rolling down a hill. Twenty years later, some things have changed: I've transplanted myself from California to Nashville, I've swapped back and forth between genres, (most recently settling into indie pop), and I've played many more shows. Despite my life changes, I've never stopped having late night songwriting sessions. The title of my autobiography will likely be, ""I Should Have Been Sleeping."" Past Lives EP Track Listing: 1. Past Lives 2. Good & Well 3. Atlas 4. No Fear Nuts and Bolts: The money raised in this campaign will go to the costs of this EP's high quality production as well as some artistic elements to accompany the songs. Musicians and producers will be paid. Studios will be rented. Band pizza will be bought. Tracking, Mixing, and Mastering engineers will all be compensated. I also plan to film at least one music video with the funds collected in this campaign. Check out my music video for the song ""Long Shot"" if you would like to see an example of what I envision. ""Long Shot"" Music Video Independent musicians need help from people like you. The music industry is constantly evolving, but the one thing that has never wavered is supporter involvement. Maybe the way artists interact with supporters has changed, but no matter what technology does to the music industry, the supporters and the artists will always have each other's backs. Your support means the world to me. Please share with all of your friends and any especially wealthy enemies you may possess. I cannot wait for you to hear the finished versions of these songs. I hope they make you dance, sing, laugh, and cry. We're creating something together, here. I hope you realize that. Art is a uniting force. Photography by Matt Blum instagram twitter Facebook"

Whatever your inspiration, Sweet Enemy is firmly planted in reminding you to never forget your reason. Grammie Rose And Me Sweet Enemy Clothing was founded in 2013, in honor of my Grammie Rose Ventula. The name ""SWEET ENEMY"" visually and metaphorically symbolizes her name, Rose, and how her passing had a tremendous impact on my life, as well as many others. The ""ROSE"" is a symbol of balance. The beauty of this flower expresses LOVE, PROMISE, HOPE, and NEW BEGINNINGS. In contrast, the thorns represent the HURT, PAIN, and SUFFERING that one goes through when losing a loved one or when opportunities pass us by. The slogan, �NEVER FORGET THE REASON� exemplifies the true meaning of what inspires us to excel in life, and to never give up. Growing up I admired my Grammie Rose and her impeccable sense of fashion and passion for gardening. In honor of her, I have spent the last few years focusing on my craft and bringing my vision and concept to life: �THE WORLD'S SWEETEST GARDEN"" A floral/garden inspired streetwear boutique Front of Store ""The Florist"" Sweet Enemy Section ""The Garden"" Thrift/Vintage Section Store View I humbly ask for your support and generosity in helping SWEET ENEMY CLOTHING transform vision into reality and grow �THE WORLD SWEETEST GARDEN,"" specializing in streetwear and vintage/thrift apparel. Yeah that's right, vintage! I'm excited to share with you the perfect compliment to our concept that allows us to provide you with the nostalgia and high quality of yesterday. The goal is to open our doors to you in August, 2019, exactly 6 years from when Sweet Enemy Clothing was first launched from the back of my car trunk. By opening this store it will allow us the opportunity to host events and do what we do best: Give back to the community. Given this opportunity and this location, I will achieve my biggest dream and be able to serve, share, and inspire. Again, thank you for your support! If you have read this far, I hope that I have sparked some motivation or inspired you in some way. Over the years, I had the privilege to meet such amazing people and I am excited to meet many more.

Besides their practical simplicity, they also evoke a certain beauty. Several years ago, while learning about color vision as a student in optometry school, I thought it would be cool if you could make your own custom Ishihara-style images. My initial attempt at this failed, so I put the idea on hold. But now, after a recent breakthrough, you can order your very own custom IshiPrints! These unique works of art will look gorgeous as part of your home or office decor. They also make great gifts for birthdays, anniversaries, baby or wedding showers, etc. If you don't want to order a hard-copy print, you can order the image just as a digital file (in PNG format). These are great for websites, social media, and other digital design projects. I can make many custom images, but keep in mind that due to the nature of the Ishihara test style (a collage of colored circles) there are limits to the resolution that can be achieved. Fine details and thin lettering will likely be lost when converting to an IshiPrint. (On that note, it bears mentioning that these works of art are NOT approved to actually test if someone viewing them is colorblind.) I'm raising funds to help with the software development (which is mostly completed--still tweaking a few settings) as well as the printer testing, as it can be a challenge to match printed colors exactly with what you see on a high-definition screen. I'm passionate about this project because I love the culture of the eyecare world. People seeing these IshiPrints will instantly recognize the link to the color vision test patterns, and I want to create something that adds beauty to that world. (This image says ""WOW!"" in case you are red-green color blind and can't see the letters.) Available Backer Rewards To support this creative campaign and bring IshiPrints to life you have a couple options: 1) Order a pre-made IshiPrint from the gallery (see images below); 2) Order a custom IshiPrint made just for you! Here are the steps/guidelines: a. Choose the size you want (11""x17"", 18""x24"", or 24""x36""), or you can order a digital file download (in PNG format). b. If/when the campaign is successfully funded, backers of custom IshiPrint rewards will be contacted via e-mail to specify exactly what they would like: the colors, the text and/or images, etc. Files can be sent to Jonathan@ishiprints.com. c. Backers of custom orders will receive a digital proof to approve before the IshiPrint is produced and sent to their shipping address. d. RULES for CUSTOM ORDERS: 1. No trademarked logos, such as for pro or college sports teams. (I don't want to get sued!) 2. I reserve the right to reject any custom image creation requests, such as for requests that are overly complex. I'm pretty good, but I can't recreate Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" (though I have tried...). 3. Due to the resolution limitations of the IshiPrint style, the image you have in mind for transforming into a custom IshiPrint might not turn out how you envision it. In these cases you will have the option of submitting another image/design. Gallery of Pre-Made IshiPrints Available to Order ""EYES"" Inspired by Robert Indiana's LOVE sculpture; available in multiple color combinations (Backers will be able to select colors *after* ordering).

We soon learned how creativity and chemistry could culminate in something amazing. From simple ingredients, something utilitarian and beautiful was created as soap. I slowly started making my own as I learned about colorants, fragrances, butters, oils, and recipes until I was able to produce soaps to gift to friends and family. Once I started receiving requests for certain types of bars, I launched my own business to share my handcrafted clean experience. My company name urban solace comes from the words: �urban- adj: characteristic of city life� and �solace-noun: something that provides comfort or peace�. What's In It? All of my carefully formulated products are created in small batches of 8-10 items each. I try to source everything locally (coffee grounds, teas, botanicals, honey and beeswax) and ensure ingredients are pure and sustainable as I believe you create amazing things from only the best supplies. I enjoy infusing herbs into olive oil as I believe it adds unique richness to each bar. I use skin safe fragrances free from parabens, phthalates or synthetics and essential oils are therapeutic grade. In addition to my natural line, I explore new fragrances and colorants in my artisan soaps. Artisan Soaps I filmed making individual soap batches so others can see how simple and pure the process is: Click Here to see Lavender Soap Making . Recently I expanded my natural products to include a spa line with lotion bars, balms, bath salts as well as candles. Made with Epsom & Sea Salts Growing to new markets My customer base is largely from referrals. I am grateful to have such loyal fans and want to share what they love and launch into new markets. I believe once you understand what is in your products you have a greater love for natural, local & sustainable sourcing. I am looking for support to redesign my branding and expand my presence from online to craft and farmer's markets. Eventually if the support is significant, I will be able to transition to my dream of teaching others how to make their own soap and beauty products from natural ingredients. Your Gifts I am excited to share my work with you! I have a wide selection of fragrances, oils and bars to choose from for each level. Each bar you receive will have a complete list of ingredients for that specific recipe/bar. Following is a list of most commonly used ingredients in our soaps: Olive Oil: Cold Pressed, Coconut Oil: Organic and Ultra Refined, Castor Oil, Shea Butter: Both Refined and Unrefined, Essential Oils, Kaolin Clay, Skin Safe Fragrance & Colorants Thank you for your consideration! Your support will help me expand to markets with: Branding & Advertising: I designed my own packaging and logo in the interest of being cost effective. I am looking for a professional designer to best represent my brand and how fantastic my products are for my customers. Show Display: Come visit my booth! This would include the setup for my products/soaps, an engaging banner with logo, if needed trade show insurance, table cover/table, and recycled logo paper bags. Packaging: I use sustainable, re-usable and recycled when possible to package my products. Labels, glass jars, soap boxes and paper shred help present and protect my work. Packaging Pictures"

There's so much excitement when you ask that question! Gear Fur is a project aimed at bringing more of that joy into the world, to make excursions with our dogs safer and more enjoyable. Beta Testers Why Re-Invent the Dog Leash? Gear Fur began with a broken leash. My wife, Avonlea, was leaving the dog park with our two Siberian Huskies, Hoshi and Yuki, when a brand-new leash simply snapped. They all managed to get home safely that day, and it could have been a lot worse, but it made us realize that we needed gear we could actually trust. After years of hard work, and 13 successful Kickstarter projects we steadily acquired all of the tools and know-how needed to make the perfect dog leash, designed and built to a higher standard. The Problem Dogs are family, but many don't see it that way. So most dog gear is designed down to a price, rather than up to any kind of performance expectation. Most leashes have 3 problems in common: Problem 1 - Safety: Most latches can release accidentally. It's especially common when maneuvering in and out of the car, so an ""accidental release"" is likely to happen in a parking lot, or near a road. Accidental Release Examples Problem 2 - Functionality: Comfort and Ease-of-Use take a back seat to how the leash looks. Most leashes look good, but are awkward to use, often requiring the human to use two hands to attach and release. Problem 3 - Quality: Because manufacturers and retailers are obsessed with reducing cost, inferior materials are often specified for the strap and clasp, and you can't tell just by looking, as we learned ourselves when a name-brand leash simply snapped. The Solution (How it Works) After our close call, I began designing our own dog gear from the ground up, using custom machined hardware and high-quality materials. The goal was to make the best leash possible, whatever the cost. Avonlea and I went through dozens of prototypes before getting it perfect, but this is the result: Feature 1- Redundant Latch Mechanism: The leash is very very unlikely to ever release accidentally, because both latches must be depressed simultaneously. Feature 2 - Hyper Functionality: Push to connect, and squeeze to release: Making the bond between human and beast should be easy and graceful. And if you're as clumsy as my wife, you need all the help you can get. She knows I'm joking... but seriously ;) The hands-free leash belt is also quick-release, and practically connects itself, because it uses the same high-strength, locking magnetic buckle concept that we designed for our ""Quicky"" Kickstarter project. Feature 3 - Ball Bearing Swivel: When your dog pulls on its leash, most swivels lock up due to the increased friction, causing twists and tangles. Meanwhile, our ball bearing swivel remains smooth-as-butter, even under hundreds of pounds of tension. Feature 4 - Padded Handle: If you have a powerful dog, prone to pulling arms out of sockets, it's a relief to have some soft padding between your hand and their raw pulling force. Feature 5 - Aircraft Grade Materials: Underneath the smooth anodized surface, you'll find CNC machined components, made from heat-treated Aircraft-Grade Aluminum (6061-T6 and 7075-T6). Anodized Aluminum Construction After machining, the parts are polished and anodized to achieve a smooth durable finish, according to Military Specification (MIL-A-8625). Feature 6 - Made in the USA with Quality Materials: All under one roof. From machining, to assembly, to sewing and shipping, we do it all right here. It's not the cheapest way to make a leash, but QUALITY is our priority. The Standard Leash Color Options Include: Sea Glass (top), Black, Blue Camo, Coyote Brown, Navy Blue, Paw Prints, Pink, Blue, Wolf Grey, and Purple The Climbing Rope Leash Does your dog destroy normal leashes? This one will give the furry ball of terror a run for its money. They're constructed with authentic American-made climbing rope (not the stuff you see in your local pet store). Climbing Rope Leash - Blue Color Options Include: Blue (top), Black, Neon Green, Olive Drab, and Burnt Orange The Double-Leash The only thing better than walking one dog is... walking two dogs! The Double-Leash makes it an absolute pleasure. All CNC machined connectors, three of our exclusive ball bearing swivels, and a comfortable padded handle. You'll have the nicest leash in the neighborhood, guaranteed. Double-Leash (rope version) - Black The Double-Leash is made with your choice of standard flat webbing or climbing rope. Color Options: Same as for the Standard and Climbing Rope Leashes The Magnetic Belt Hands-free dog walking is the way of the future! Using our ultra-secure magnetic buckle design, this belt is the perfect companion to any leash. It's super quick to put on and off, and adjusts to any size. And its beefy aluminum construction will endure loads that could easily snap a plastic buckle. Color Options Include: Sea Glass, Black, Blue Camo, Coyote Brown, Navy Blue, Paw Prints, Pink, Blue, Wolf Grey, and Purple Hands Free Leash Belt About Us We're a husband and wife team with a track record of success, fulfilling 13 Kickstarter campaigns to over 5000 backers all around the world.

However, we do have a bold plan to do our part for dogs in need. This isn't limited to this Kickstarter project.

Commando Every champion was once an amateur. Ryan Garcia's Brother Punching a Cobra Bag Canelo $120 USD (no parts included) See rewards. Even mom's love it. No formal training required. Don't mess with mom's! Perfect every punch in the arsenal -- jabs, power punches, hooks, uppercuts, angled punches, rapid combinations, and more � plus slipping, weaving and defensive drills. Melt the fat off the fun way. How did Commando Bag achieve its performance? First: The sluggish recoil common with reflex bags, was resolved by positioning the spring near the punching bag, not its base. The result? A quick, whipping recoil that amazed even boxers with years of experience: �I was shocked by the speed and power with which the punching bag reacted back. It almost broke my defense (laughing) But, being serious, this is how an opponent would fight back in the ring or on the street,� says Simone Coleman, 7 years of boxing experience. Second: The base is designed for common use. We've designed a non-spill base. Commando Bag is designed with a wide square plate base fitted with suction cups underneath. Stick your base onto approved surfaces or weigh your bag down with gym weights. Third: The bag has a �quiet� design that lets you train in peace without worrying about the noise your power punches are making. It�s designed for home training or as a piece of gym equipment which can be placed anywhere. Is Commando Bag a perfect fit for you? Assemble in less than 5-minutes! We wanted to give the underdogs hope, we wanted to make any warrior - no matter what size, feel like a champion. I named it Commando for this reason: they're lean mean machines! This bag isn't like a conventional 'reflex bag' for a reason: we wanted to design and refine a punching bag for the average joe & jane. Instead of using the cheapest materials and the most conventional way to build a punching bag, we first explored the reflex bag design - we reverse engineered it. It took months to find a design that was stable and could hold-up against powerful punches. �After a while, training with a [common] reflex bag becomes predictable and boring,� Shawn Edwards, amateur boxer. The Commando team took valuable feedback from seasoned boxers and made it our mission to innovate a training experience. Our ultimate goal was to provide & merge an adequate workout with training that prepares ANYONE for a real situation. A special thank you to Top Notch Training in Fort Lauderdale, FL.

Bop �N Pop. We strongly believe that music is a universal language that crosses all barriers and will help us spread our message around the world. In addition to basic children�s education (including learning about the alphabet, colors, basic math, etc.), the emphasis will include: healthy hygiene practices, personal safety, diet, being physically active, and teaching kids how to practice a smaller ecological footprint, among other important topics and skills. We plan to give parents beneficial tips and creative strategies to promote a healthy lifestyle for their kids as well as themselves. We are very passionate about this project and want our audience to learn with us and of course, to have fun along the way! GOALS: To encourage children of all ages to live healthy lifestyles today so they can fulfill their dreams tomorrow, with the help of music and theatre. Complete a full children's album containing approximately 15 songs professionally produced and mastered, focused on multiple educational subjects as noted above. The music is going to be great, we promise - just take a listen to our samples provided!!!! Create at least three animated music videos featuring the cartoon characters, Drs.

Nice! �Mitch Hammer fills that Kurt Russell-Big Trouble in Little China-grand-80s-Action-Comedy-Cheese hole in your heart! Do your eyeballs a favor and pick it up immediately if not sooner!� -Fred Van Lente (Amazing Spider-Man, Archer & Armstrong, Eat Fighter) MITCH HAMMER is a 3-issue mini-series about mustaches, monsters, and the militant wing of the National Blood Clot Association. Written by Chris Lewis, drawn by Fernando Pinto, colored by Kurt Michel Russell, and lettered by Marco Della Verde, this over-the-top comedy was inspired by 80s action flicks and the greatest comic book of all time � Nextwave. After crushing the first Kickstarter campaigns for issues 1-2, we are back to show you how it all ends! (Trust me, it�s with a bang.) We are coming to Kickstarter to raise money for the production costs of issue #3. Clocking in at 24 pages and a whopping XXL 7.5 x 11 format - WAY BIGGER THAN YOUR STANDARD U.S. COMIC SIZE - issue #3 rounds out the story of our lovable lug of a construction worker. As with the first two campaigns, we�ve got digital books that are easy on the wallet, as well as extra goodies that come along with the print version. So have a look at what we have on offer, and please consider joining us for a final trip into the world of Mitch. Mitch Hammer is a construction worker on-site at the local community college, who finds himself squaring off against C.L.O.T., the militant wing of the National Blood Clot Association. To quickly bring you up to speed (spoiler alert), Mitch was at ground zero of a science-gone-wrong �splosion, where got a backhoe bucket arm� Then he met a professor turned caterpillar, er, manerpillar� Punched some living blod clots� Thought about his life choices... Dug some tunnels� And ran into a giant pupa. Do you want to see what�s inside that vile sack? Then maybe the cover will offer you a clue! As you might have noticed in our first two issues, Mitch doesn�t like waiting around. Neither do we. That�s why we�re happy to say this oversized 24-page issue is 100% complete! We�ll be sending it to the printers as soon as the campaign ends, and your books will loudly announce their presence in your mailbox in a timely manner. Until then here�s a taste of what you can expect inside: And here's what people are saying about it: ""Mitch Hammer is some strange, alluring combination of Silver Age antics and Coen brothers� characters. I�d call it zany, but zany is a gross understatement for these idiosyncratic hijinks."" - Adrian Wassel, Editor-in-Chief @ Vault Comics �If you enjoy lip curling and an explosion of hammer puns, welcome home.� � A Place To Hang Your Cape ��Mitch Hammer� #1 is a book where a man�s mullet and handle-bar mustache sail in the breeze while he stands between tendrils of smoke and flame lapping at his legs and threatens a mutant bug-man.� � Multiversity Comics Over here at MITCH central we don�t do floppy. That�s why MITCH HAMMER #3, just like issues #1-2, is a BIG book. Here it is compared to a standard comic: A hefty book like this needs to be stable, which is why we are printing on heavy paper stock for both the cover and interior pages. And while these books can withstand tons of punishment, we want yours to be in pristine condition when it arrives. That's why we bag and board each issue, and ship using reinforced envelopes, for the absolute sturdiest of packages. All physical backers will receive this BIG A4-size poster from superstar Hus Ozkan. We've been lucky enough to feature Hus' artwork in every campaign, and he absolutely outdid himself this time! We're asking for $2000 to make this happen. That should just cover the costs of printing and shipping the books and other material to all our backers. Anything above and beyond our goal will go towards producing more great stuff for you to enjoy (extra posters, anyone?). Mitch won't make us rich, but he will make you happy. That's what this is all about. Chris Lewis - writer An Oregonian who lives in Germany with his wife and son, Chris is the writer of DRONES (IDW), MIXMANCER, and KARMA POLICE (Vault).

My name is Jennifer (most refer to me as Jen). I�m a mom to three spectacular boys, Chase 16, Gabe 14, and Jayden 11. In December of 2015, I didn�t have money to purchase Christmas gifts for family. I had recently come out of a domestic violence marriage. I was getting food assistance weekly from a place called Gleaners. During one of my weekly pickups of food I received a bountiful gift of blackberries. Prior to my separation, I was a stay-at-home mom and volunteered the majority of my spare time at the boys� school. I had not been able to volunteer anymore and felt bad. To show my gratefulness and appreciation to the staff, I made them a Blackberry Cheesecake. It was such a big hit that it gave me the idea to make cheesecakes paired with wine for my family for Christmas. I took a picture of the cheesecakes I made and posted them on my personal Facebook page stating, �Cheesecakes made with love by Jen.� Facebook post I had three friends reach out to me and ask if they could pay me to make them a cheesecake for New Years. Let�s just say I was speechless and in utter shock! I remember when I received my first payment I cried. This was when ""Cheesecakes By Jen"" originated. Now three and half years later I have made over 400 cheesecakes. I have delivered as far North to Vancouver and South to Albany. A friend froze one of my cheesecakes and snuck it in her luggage to Colorado. Stowaway cheesecake My Salted Caramel has gone for $600 at a local charter school auction. I continually hear that my cheesecakes are �the best,� �amazing,� �to die for,�and ""orgasmic."" I�m honored and humbled every time. Honestly, I don�t know what makes my cheesecakes so special other than I really do make them with my whole heart. I do love feeding souls! Over the last three years, I pursued a degree in Social Work while navigating being a full time single mom, student and a 16 hour per week practicum. In the midst of all that, I also juggled many court trials, depositions, custody evaluations, restraining orders and immediate danger orders, moved twice, houseless for three weeks, countless counseling appointments, mediation, kids attorney, DHS, and the list goes on and on. Cheesecakes became my stability. Making them became a form of therapy for me. My mind would stop racing as I made them and it's still the same to this day. After the above, I graduated with honors from Portland State University last summer 2018. This was a HUGE accomplishment as I am the first-generation college graduate in my family. As school wrapped up the demand for my cheesecakes grew. Not the direction I had envisioned but doors kept opening for me to have my own storefront shop. I found a space downtown Silverton. I will be able to sell cheesecakes wholesale to local restaurants, while still providing cheesecakes to my beloved customers that I have grown to know personally and love. The end goal is to have the shop space be a place for community to gather and for customers to come in and enjoy a scrumptious, decadent dessert. I have two main mottos I live by: �Each day is a gift� and �You only live once.� I've chosen to jump and take this risk of opening up a shop. I don't want to live with regrets. I�ve realized that I can integrate my social work practice within my cheesecake business. My dreams are to grow and expand to where I can hire individuals with barriers or need a hand up. I want the shop to be an opportunity to bless the community. Not just with the deliciousness of cheesecake but as an experience; an environment that cultivates community, warmth, love, joy, empowerment, inspiration, friendship, acceptance, etc. The space did not come with a kitchen. I�m raising funds for the kitchen, to provide an ADA bathroom as well as other renovations. I have been finding used commercial equipment here and there, yet still in need of mixers, ovens, a freezer, POS System and general inventory. I can't thank you enough in advance for any dollar amount gifted. I'm super sentimental which means your name will be placed on a wall in the kitchen called the ""Backers"" wall. :) Beloved Cheesecakes belongs to a Beloved community of supporters near and far. The boys and I look forward to sharing the rewards with you! With an enormous grateful heart, Jen"

Tag @emptiescomics on any photo of #gummyhorror and I�ll DM you a FREE digital copy of The Empties, Issue #1. NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES! The Empties - When a housewife contracts a flesh-eating illness, she and her husband try desperately to survive, and in the process, rekindle a love that is literally all-consuming! If you love body horror, this is our love letter to the genre! My obsession with body horror: I was in high school science class when I was first introduced to the movie that would mold my obsession with the body horror genre - and that was David Cronenberg�s The Fly. I remember that friends and I loved that movie so much that we went home and had �The Fly� parties. We watched all the versions of The Fly. But David Cronenberg�s left a lasting impression. Not only is it the story that most inspired The Empties, it is the story that also turned me on to horror. I�ve been a bit obsessed with body mutations since then. I, of course, went on and watched almost all of Cronenberg�s films and I also found punk rock movies like Troma�s Toxic Avenger, Stuart Gordon�s From Beyond (and Re-Animator!) and so many more (Xtro, Hellraiser, Slither, Bad Taste� you know the ones!)! I absolutely love this kind of horror because it is focuses on human beings who go through horrific transformations! That feels more real to me for some reason. We understand that they are not monsters, and we feel for them as they become monsters. But it is not the physical that makes you a monster, it�s the inner self and horrific actions that makes a person a monster. The Empties is a comic book series about humans who turn into gummy like monsters with a taste for flesh and all the while trying to survive this thing called love! The Team The Empties is a horror comic book limited series. We successfully brought Issue #1 and #2 to life, and like any good zombie story, we need to do it again! The good news is that, Issue #3 is complete! So what we really need money for is this: to print Issue #4 and keep our artists from starving to death while they work on Issue #4, 5, and 6 I believe in this project 100%. That is why I put $800 of every paycheck I make into creating this comic book series. And believe me, if I could spare more, I would. Because believe it or not, it does cost more than that (I�m sure you�ll believe me after I break down the budget for you). I pay Eli a rate of $240 per page. Many people do not pay their indie artists as much as I pay Eli, but this is not foolish spending on my part. No! The quality of the art is unlike anything you have ever seen before. Eli is a master at horror and an absolute professional who deserves even more than I can pay, which is why I also offered him a small percentage of the net profits. Next, this comic book series is shaping up exactly how I imagined it. Again, I was worried that luck would not strike three times and that this third issue might be the one where we failed, but we did it! And it wasn't by luck! Eli does such an amazing job time and time again. So, the rate I pay Eli means that we deliver the best quality possible. For Lettering, I pay Marshall $20 per page. This is probably the most insanely reasonable rate anyone of his talent has offered anyone. He is so generous when working with indie authors and he delivers the most impressive letters I have ever seen. You can see for yourself here in this FREE 22 page preview! For the Front Cover - I have worked out a licensing deal with Jeanne where I pay her to create original art, which she still owns, and I give her a 5 cent royalty on every issue we sell. Needless to say, she deals primarily in the fine arts, and to commission a custom work from her would cost anyone well in the thousands of dollars. So you can see what a great deal she is giving me. And last but not least, Zimri is our graphic designer who designed up the titles on the front and back cover and the credits page on the inside of the book. He is insanely talented and puts all the finishing touches on the issue to make sure it is perfect. Zimri gets a varying rate depending on the difficulty of the work. Generally, this budget is $250 for the work he delivers. When you all that all up you get the following: Artist - 22 pages + back cover at $240/ page = $5,520 Letterer - 22 pages + Recap page at $20/ page = $460 Cover Artist - Base + 5 cent royalty Graphic Designer - Various projects - $250 = $250 Grand Total - minimum $6230 per issue of The Empties Wow. That�s a lot of money! And that�s before printing costs. But it is worth every penny, and I wouldn't dream of not paying my artists. So like I said, I put $800 of every paycheck I make into this project, and I will continue to do so until all 6 issues are complete. Now, if we are ever going to: get the 4th issue printed, and get the comics finished in a reasonable time frame Then this indie project needs your help! That�s what this Kickstarter is for. It is so that we can send you a beautiful copy of the third issue AND keep up the quality and the pace for the 4th issue and more. Without your help: It will take longer for the 4th issue to be released. (This would also be sad... BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE! YAY!) Where is my money going? Great question! Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. It should be a pretty good guide on where your money is going. If we don�t raise that money, this project will take more time to produce. But this is happening. We�re not stopping now. The #gummyhorror will spread! People really loved the first two comics: Women are too often vilified. We turn them into monsters. And if they are not monsters, the women exist only for men. (Think I�m wrong? Ask yourself how many comics and movies pass the Bechdel test?) As a woman, I reject these notions. My woman is fierce and she is flawed, making her equal to the men portrayed in The Empties. She has the courage to try to escape a relationship that has trapped her in traditional roles (even if she loses herself in the process). Helen, a trapped housewife, is the one who makes a firm decision to leave her husband, and she is clear and upfront about it. This is not an easy situation to be in. After all, it is not easy to claim that neglect is abuse. But she has been emotionally abused, and she lashes out. Helen is not a hero or a role model, she is a woman trying to claim her own identity, and the process is impossible because, in this story, she is literally turning into a zombie. It is painful to watch her lose herself. She is rundown, overpowered, and trapped. At first, we think that she is the monster (and that�s before she turns into a zombie). Her flaws are evident. After all, she is the one who cheated on her husband. But as we learn more and more about these people, we learn that her husband, Derrick, is controlling and that Helen is justified in her feelings. She is not a pet or a doll, but she sure is treated like one. We sympathize with each of the characters at different points in the story. But it is Derrick who commits the most monstrous acts. He justifies these acts in the name of love. It is too real, because we have all done desperate and horrible things in the name of love. I see a lot of myself in Derrick; I�ve made similar mistakes. I don�t believe in black and white monsters (only black and white comics, haha). I believe that every person is capable of monstrous things and that every person is equally capable of wonderful things. The Empties shows the monstrous side of people in love. Issue #3 Art!

As it stands now, the procedure to swap nozzles includes, cooling the machine down, removing the existing filament, and then removing the nozzle. This operation requires the use of a combination of 2 tools. The two devices are the crescent wrench to secure the heater block and the socket wrench to remove the nozzle. The current removal procedure is cumbersome and can take up to 20 min. The Nozzle Removal Tool is essentially one tool in which the user will be able to change nozzles. This tool works by allowing the top component to secure to the heater block and using the lower part to remove the nozzle. Our goal is to turn this product into an everyday item Makers can use. This tool would reduce machine downtime and make changing nozzles safer and more accessible. Photos and illustrations below show the functionality and blueprint diagram of the apparatus. Technical Information: The Nozzle Removal consists of 6 components, not including the heater block, nozzle, and 1/4 inch socket. Heater Block Compatibility Dimensions: 48 mm (1.889 in) x 23 mm (0.905 in) x 14 mm (0.55 in) Weight: 233.22 Grams (0.514 lbs) Expanded Length: 3.23 in (82 mm) Compressed Length: 2.57 in (65.27 mm) Overall Diameter: 1.25 in (31.75 mm) Gripping area is composed of Material is 304 Stainless Steel.

Final testing and material selection are critical before mass distribution. Additionally, we are in the process of looking into adding more functionality to our tool for future versions. A safety mechanism is being researched to prevent the user from over torque of the nozzle; this will cause damage to the heater block. Additional features such as ratcheting will allow for more rapid removal of the nozzle. Manufacturing and distribution are a crucial aspect of the success of meeting your expectations. International Shipping costs for those are a priority. We will ensure product delivery at a reasonable price. If funding is met the distributing our product will follow our set schedule outlined below. Our goal is to grow the Nozzle Removal Tool in this direction using local machine shops as our Manufacturing supplier."

After weeks of learning how to create an Android application I had done it, I had created the simple list app that I had been searching for. I was going to keep it for myself but my wife urged me to share it with the world through Google Play. It has had a few hundred downloads and very positive feedback. My wife decided she wanted different colors so I added that option just designing a few color options. That was the extent of the frills that I had planned. Simple and Sweet. Now I am seeing a big benefit of being able to share your lists across devices(I have had a few users lose their lists because of getting new phones). Looking into doing this I find that it will be costly, not just the development but storing and accessing the data.

This deck is highly recommended for creatives, leaders, and entrepreneurs, and can be used by individuals, partners, and small groups. How to use the deck All exercises listed below are included and described in the MAP guidebook (included with every deck). A ""spread"" is the term used to describe how the cards are physically laid out. SOLO Theme of the day - a simple technique to use for inspiration and self-reflection Creative meditation - use the MAP guidebook as a resource for a variety of meditations: some are visualizations, others include breathing exercises, and a few will call for you to act Goal Setting & Action Planning Spread - focus on a specific goal you'd like to achieve by a certain date WITH A PARTNER Core Values Spread - brainstorm and identify core values in a specific area: business/career, love, personal growth, wellness, parenting, etc. Have-Desire-Require Spread - this check-in spread is helpful for identifying strengths and opportunities for growth Goal Setting & Action Planning Spread - focus on a specific goal you'd like to achieve by a certain date AS A GROUP Collaboration Spread - a great team-building/ice-breaker exercise Dinner Talk Spread - a fun way to spark conversation and get to know one another Core Values Spread - create a creative mission statement There are 54 cards in the deck. Each card is accompanied by a written meditation in the MAP guidebook. Several of the spreads include prompts to identify actionable steps, so it may be helpful to have writing materials close by to record your thoughts as you go. The artwork For The Moody Deck, I wanted to create images that were visually appealing, but also meditative, which is why I committed to simple color palettes and balanced abstract images. I did extensive research on color symbolism and color's effect on mood to create this beautiful deck. All images come from original watercolor paintings I completed over the last six months. About the name...why ""moody""? I've often wondered why the word mood, defined as a temporary state of mind or feeling, is neutral, but the word moody is typically given a negative connotation (e.g. crabby, cross, and sulky). Here's the truth as I see it: we are always moody, because we are always in some temporary state of mind or feeling. When we are happy, energized, motivated, adventurous, or inspired, we are experiencing mood! With this deck, I'm embracing the fact that we, as humans, are moody creatures. For goal-setting and action-planning purposes, I've chosen to focus on the moods that uplift and further progression. The goods Each set of The Moody Deck includes: Fifty-four 2.75"" x 4.75"" high-quality, matte-finish cards printed in color, front and back* 4.25"" x 6.875"" 68-page Meditation & Action Planning (MAP) guidebook a tuck box to keep your cards fresh and safe *please note the design on the back of the cards is not reversible, as The Moody Deck doesn't require different interpretations for cards drawn in reverse Estimated ship date: September 2019.

I started collecting vinyl toys around 2007 and have had an unhealthy obsession with them ever since. Shortly after becoming a collector I started trying to sculpt my own toys. I haven�t had any formal training so there was a lot of trial and error along with some pretty hideous looking toys! With the dream of making my own toys I continued to practice for many years. Though I am not anywhere near where I want to be, I finally got to a point last year where I thought what I was making was good enough to be made into my first vinyl toy. It�s hard to describe the feeling of sculpting clay for hours and hours on end, sending it off half way around the world, and finally receiving a giant box with a bunch of vinyl toy reproductions, but it is something I hope to experience again and again in the years to come! My first toy has a furry cyclops monster who goes by the name Rowlii. After Rowlii, I helped an incredible Russian artist named Acid Ma turn one of his illustrations into a soft vinyl toy. The result was a maggot infested worm called The Cherv, which was also brought to life through a kickstarter campaign. Most recently I self funded a set of two smaller two piece toys that I am calling The Ugly Twins. Images of all these toys can be found on my Instagram page @binbizii. tV HeAd will be my 4th sculpt to become part of the Phobia Toys line up. In my opinion this sculpt is one of my best to date and with six separate pieces it allows for more possible positions than any other toy I've attempted to create. With the recent investment in the ugly twins I just don't have the funds to bring tV HeAd to life on my own. tV HeAd: tV HeAd prototype tV HeAd prototype turnaround tV head is approximately 4.25"" tall with five points of articulation. There will be 4 colors to begin with. This is a pretty basic campaign with the rewards focusing on the toy itself. There will be 3 different options. The first reward is for a single blank vinyl toy. The second level will be for the painted kickstarter exclusive. The last option is a tV HeAd 4-pack which includes one of each color. Thank you: Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter campaign! I hope you that you can find something in your price range to help make this toy come to life. If you have any questions or just want to be a nerd and chat about how much you love toys, please shoot me an email at phobiatoys@gmail.com"

It�s smart, highly secure and seamless. No more trying to guess which ride is yours on crowded streets or outside venues. No more approaching or getting into wrong cars. And no more risking�sometimes very serious harm�to you and those you love from someone posing as a rideshare driver. Keeping your connections safe, every time Uber provides 15 million rides per day. Lyft reached 1 billion rides in 2018. That�s a lot of people jumping into strangers� cars. Most times with little thought of the possible dangers. But that�s the world we live in today. But with explosive ride demand and a relentless push to grow, rideshare companies have left a huge hole in rider security. There�s little today to stop someone from pretending to be your ride and do harm. That�s what really worries me. I�ve used rideshare. I have kids that use it. I have relatives, friends, co-workers and others that I care for that use it regularly. We all do. So when I see the news stories popping up with growing regularity of harm coming to people from fake rideshare drivers�it makes me think: Who�s really looking out for the rider in all of this? Posing as a rideshare driver is easy to do and happening now. Take a look: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 It�s a serious problem that needs fixing No rideshare company wants to publicly admit it�s a growing problem or bring attention to it. It�s clear their immediate attention is to grab market share as fast as possible before the other guy. We�re convinced it�s time to do better and force this safety problem to be fixed. And your backing can help make a real difference. By kickstarting our project: You�ll help send a message and push the rideshare industry to take this problem much more seriously You�ll help us create a proof-of-concept solution that we can put right in front of them Create a safer, more secure rideshare experience for all riders Securing your ride How do you know�for sure�the rideshare you�re getting into is the one you ordered? Think of a busy street after a concert, outside a nightclub on Saturday night or pretty much anywhere. You can look carefully at the car, check the license plate, and check the driver photo. But how many people are really doing this? And what if the ride has been hacked? Check out that generic car photo provided by the rideshare app. It�s not even the same color of the car you�re looking for half the time. Look out into a crowd of cars that look pretty similar nowadays�which one is yours? Then there�s going to that lone car in the middle of nowhere that you�re convinced must be yours as you walk toward it. Add in rain or snow, a dark night�and it doesn�t get better. It happened to me outside a busy airport in the middle of night One floor of the parking garage was set up just for rideshare and had cones directing them all over the place. There were about 30 rideshare cars moving around in there. Riders where walking back and forth, knocking on windows and trying to find their rides. I found it absurd. And it took me three shots to finally connect with my own ride. I saw just how trusting people really are. Few took the time to do basic security protocols. They usually just asked are you my so-and-so ride?...and then got in It�s pretty hard to change human behavior. We saw the same thing time and again. So we are taking a different approach to security by putting powerful technology behind it. Take a look at what IdentiRide can do: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 How did we come up with the idea? It started when George was outside a gated condo complex deep in the night. No one was around. He was just about to call his girlfriend to buzz him in, when he was startled by a knock on his car window. �You my Uber ride?� asked the 20-something young lady. She showed no signs of being drunk, but still had walked right up to a stranger�s car. He quickly sent her on her way. But he kept thinking how could this have happened? It also got him thinking about his daughter who lives in a city and uses rideshare all the time. This rattled around inside his head for quite a while. So he started researching and paying much more attention to the issue. In our meet-ups he told us about it, and we started to pay much more attention ourselves. We became convinced there had to be a better way to protect riders before they get into their rideshares. That�s where our product IdentiRide comes in Rideshare companies provide the basics to help you find your ride when it shows up. But it�s far from exact and security is surprisingly lax�especially when you actually approach and get into the car. IdentiRide is an AI-based platform that includes a blockchain security to assess, identify and secure every aspect your individual ride transaction. No guessing if your ride and driver that show up is legit, and no more fumbling around looking for your ride in a sea of lookalike cars. Or worse, getting into a fake rideshare with a driver intent on harm. And let�s face it, people aren�t always their sharpest after a night of partying when it's time to get home. IdentiRide will offer: Seamless integration with rideshare apps and systems Provides all benefits and features through the rideshare app you are using. IDs and tracks the car before its arrival right to you Guides you right to the exact car using multiple outputs including step-by-step visual, audio and tactile guidance. Alerts you when you head to the wrong car or veer off at any time and gets you back on the correct path to your specific ride. Protects you from fake rideshare drivers and potential harm�before you�re ever in the car Alerts you if anything is amiss Constant verification in real time of correct ride, distance and time to arrival. You�ll be instantly warned when the AI detects any problems outside the verified parameters for your ride and driver along its entire way to you. Driver confirmation is assured Two-way, virtually un-crackable blockchain solution between rider and driver makes sure the driver they send is the driver you see�before getting too close or into the car. Rider safety has to matter more: And we�re going to do it I�ve used rideshare. My kids use it. I�m sure you or someone you care about has or eventually will use it. Which is really our point. Rideshare is pretty much everywhere. Fake rideshare drivers are increasingly taking advantage of people�s trust in the system�and real harm is coming to people. We believe we have a powerful security solution that could make these problems a thing of the past. Who we are We�re a few guys with a game-changing idea. But the beauty is we have the right combination of experience and skills to make this thing happen. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

And in one sense, he is the father of our first product idea to make it this far: IdentiRide. It�s funny how such a small thing can spin up such a great idea. But that�s how many big changes get started. George has more than 25 years of experience as a Wall Street financial advisor and head equities trader under his belt. So he has seen many ideas come and go. He was convinced this is a winning one that is sorely needed in the rideshare industry, and we agree. Our CTO David is our ace-in-hole. He�s a computer systems and technical guru entrepreneur that brings quite a punch to the table. He founded three IT organizations that support SMBs (Small/Medium Business), government, medical equipment vendors and healthcare providers. He has designed, architected and trained neural networks, and is actively involved in feature engineering, machine learning, machine vision and natural language processing in the AI space. For the last 20 years, David has been involved with Enterprise Information Systems, Cloud based SaaS/PaaS/MBaaS, Ecommerce and Social Web Technologies, Data Visualization and Business Intelligence Toolkits, Mobile Application Development. And to boot, he�s a consultant hired to bring Agile and Lean Six Sigma performance improvement methodologies to companies, so he�s the perfect person to keep this project on point and on task. And our CMO Steve has been in communications for more than 30 years across multiple industries. This includes stints with multi-billion dollar healthcare companies, worldwide Fortune 1,000 worldwide consumer products organization and a rapidly growing hospitality brand. And yea, as you can guess, I'm the guy that wrote this pitch. How we're going to do it We have the provisional patent filed and the plan. Now we need to raise funds to build out an initial prototype. These funds will be used for contract developers to create the proof-of-concept software platform for this, our first step on this crazy-cool journey. We expect the funds to be used follows: What has happened 2017 May: George has a brainstorm; team gets onboard Jun - Dec: Many beers are shared, initial ideas formed, we poke holes and discard many of them over the remainder of the year 2018 Jan: We have it! Mar: Specs and product design May: Now the name...so many good ones were taken, and so many websites unavailable. More beers to spur more creativity. Eureka! IdentiRide is born. June - Dec: Product design continues; web, social and pitch materials developed 2019 Jan: Thoughts of crowdfunding project begin to arise, so we start exploring that direction May: Kickstater campaign launches What's coming 2019 June: Funding campaign a success with your help (fingers crossed)! Q3: Development team contracted; work begins Q4: Alpha version developed; testing begins 2020 Q1: Changes, fixes, bugs eradicated and the like Q1 - Q2: Beta version is ready enough to begin showing; approach companies to secure partnership(s) for testing"

Your favorite surly, not-that-bright repairman keeps on the struggle of surviving through the madness that is created by a scientist that truly believes that the life of one outweighs the many. Not Drunk Enough is a horror-comedy that dives into the darkness of our minds, tugging and pulling at the idea of what we can do when we feel a little trapped. It has characters who are more monster than human, and those who just really seem to epitomize being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Harvey-nominated comic has been running for just over a year now over at notdrunkenough.com where you can catch updates on every Tuesday and Thursday! Not Drunk Enough is an incredibly special project to me, one that I keep very close to my heart. It's the story that helped me navigate some of my darkest depressions, my feelings of being trapped, and it is, in essence, a story that helped me come to understand who I really am. The journeys to finish the second book in particular were a bit difficult, so being able to come here today with it all finished and ready to go means the world to me. Here's a comic about one of the journeys in particular: Thank you for taking the time to check this out and check out samples of the pages below to get a good peek of what's in store! The books are going to collect the entirety of the second volume, along with some sweet inside looks in the back and extra content!

We will be utilizing PledgeManager to charge location and weight based shipping closer to when the campaign is being fulfilled!*** Printing, as we all know, costs a heck of a lot, and Not Drunk Enough is what it is today because of all of you! I still cannot thank everyone enough for the support that the comic has received thus far, as well as getting me through the dream of printing the first one. I really hope we can work together and bring the second one to its beautiful physical form to join it's little brother on a bookshelf! Thanks so much for your love and consideration!! Love, Tess!"

Who is the Black Tiger? Los Santos is a city at war between the jockeying gangs, the feared and reviled meta-humans, and the thinly stretched police. In between all of it, one man has served as Los Santos� self-appointed protector for over forty years: Black Tiger, the fist of justice, who uses his meta-human powers and bone-crushing kung fu to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. What no one knows is that the Black Tiger is actually the men of the Fong family, the power passed down from father to son. The Story Pacific ""Pac"" Fong, the current Black Tiger, has a strained relationship with his children. His daughter, Jenn, is the straight-as-an-arrow Assistant DA whom Pac has inadvertently lost in the shuffle as he focuses his attention on his prodigal son, Eric. Unbeknownst to Jenn, Eric is the heir to the Black Tiger power and an enforcer in the Red Dragon Triad, the most brutal gang in Chinatown. When an assassin�s bullet ends Pac�s life and grants the power to Eric, the family is shattered. Pac's web of secrets drives brother and sister onto separate journeys that collide as the fate of the city and the mantle of the Black Tiger hangs in the balance. The book is mostly finished. The story is complete and 140 pages of production are done. If the Stretch Goals are attained 37 new pages will be produced and 9 pages will be remastered. After production is complete the books will need to be prepared for printing, including the approval of proofs, printed and then shipped. Rewards We have attempted to keep reward tiers simple and limited to help things go as smoothly as possible, but if you have any questions, feel free to message us here on kickstarter or by email at bt@beyondtimecomics.com. If you want a combination of rewards or extra books, simply add the price of the reward to your pledge (no need to include extra shipping on fewer than 5 books), and you can specify what you want in a survey that will be sent out after the campaign ends. U.S. shipping for most tiers = $7 USD Unfortunately International shipping is very expensive; $15 USD in Canada and $20 USD everywhere else (not including duties and taxes that may apply in your country.) Important note for international backers: The intention is to avoid passing on customs fees, VAT taxes and tariffs for as many backers as we can, but it's possible that they may be unavoidable. You may be responsible for these fees. For the tiers including prints, sketches or original art it is expensive to ship those overseas, which is why we are collecting $40 though it actually costs more in the $50-$60 range.

I designed my first pin over a year ago and was so happy with the final product, I've wanted to make another for a while now. I love the process of designing a little 3D object and seeing where each pin goes on to live. But getting these things manufactured in big quantities is spendy! So this time, I figured I'd gauge interest and offer a preorder: You can help bring the pin to life, and I can devote more time and money to making cool stuff this Summer�without worrying quite as much about rent. Everyone who pledges will also get one of my new holographic stickers, and shipping is free within the U.S.. Not bad, right? The Details This pin will be 2 inches tall, black dye soft enamel with five colors. A proof of the final design is attached below.

I'm launching my first Kickstarter here to help fund a project I've been thinking about for a few years now, a map of the Delaware Beaches.  Riding the Junction Breakwater Trail. I started going to Lewes and Rehoboth a few years ago and fell in love with it (I even got married there)! You can't throw a stone without hitting an awesome brewery, distillery or meadery ... there's amazing food and the bike trails are top-notch! There's alot of off-beat charm that people may not notice at first glance, but that's what makes the area so special to me. Anyways, this project is my love letter to Slower Lower � I had a blast putting it together and it's finally ready for publication. The campaign finishes in early July, and the printed maps will be available to go to market by the beginning of August. My dream would be to have these available in some of the shops and local businesses featured on the map, so I'm hoping this will help to get the word out! Map features: Folds down to 3.75"" x 3.75"" so it fits in your back pocket Inset map of the main biking trails from Lewes to Rehoboth 50+ descriptions of things to see and do insider tips for all the top spots for beer and ice cream *Printing by Risolve Studio The goal of launching this campaign is to spread the word, with your support this project can be realized on an even larger scale then I initially intended. Funds raised here will go towards covering part of the cost of printing the map as well as the cost of the pins and prints. The hope is that once this is funded and I distribute the printed map to local shops in the region, the momentum from the digital campaign will propel things forward to greater success. Thanks so much for reading (if you've made it this far). Adventure onward!"

This annual festival supports the creation and production of meaningful, powerful works by women playwrights. The She LA Summer Theater Festival will present five new full-length plays. She's Not There - When Rob meets Anna, he thinks she is the one. When Anna meets Rob, she thinks she can finally be happy. But there is a third party in the relationship that may destroy their union. Every night a shadowy form seeps from the walls of Anna's apartment and tries to kill her. She�s Not There is funny and poignant - but also experimental and shocking. This is a tragicomedy that explores how depression and mental illness can hijack a relationship. The play unflinchingly portrays how depression isolates a person and how suicide can devastate the lives around them. The personification of depression is portrayed as a literal monster. THE MISSION We need to talk about depression and suicide. With this play, we want to spark a dialogue within the audience, connect our community through empathy, and spur anyone affected by depression into action. Whether that is on an individual level by reaching out to a friend in need, or on a sociopolitical level by helping to institute change, we hope this promotes understanding of those who have mental illnesses � and eliminates the stigma and confusion that�s too often present. Our mission is to use the timeless medium of live theater to foster empathy and education about a commonly taboo subject. With your donations we hope to achieve that goal. Depression is not just a mental health issue, but a public health issue as well. Too often the emotional impact of depression and suicide is marginalized and discriminated against, and access to help is out of reach to certain social classes. In addition, the stigma of mental illness makes it difficult for many to ask for help. According to statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately one in five adults in the US experiences mental illness. Only 41% actually receive help. Serious mental illnesses cost Americans around 192 billion dollars in lost earnings and suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. ACCOLADES She�s Not There is the recipient of the 2018 John Gassner award. It was also selected for the Ensemble Studio Theatre Winterfest reading series, workshopped in London at the White Bear Theatre, finalist for the Kitchen Dog Theatre New Works Festival, finalist for the Gary Marshall Theatre New Works Festival, shortlisted for the Dennis and Victoria Ross Foundation Project, semi-finalist in the Screencraft Play competition, and has been selected for the 2019 SHE NY Summer Arts festival. �We so enjoyed its explosively idiosyncratic theatricality and deceptive structure, as well as its deep probing into the world of mental health� - Clubbed Thumb Theater NYC �Exciting and fascinating. The dialogue, pacing and characterization are exceptional. A wonderful and imaginative writer� � Southwest Theatre Festival �This story has amazing dialogue...Every character is interesting and Anna�s plight, experienced by many in a theatre�s audience, is something many can relate to� � Austin Film Festival Ali MacLean and ""She's Not There"" featured in Broadway World THE FESTIVAL The opportunity to take part in this limited engagement presentation was offered by the She LA / NYC Arts Theater Festival. We are proud to have been chosen out of thousands of submissions -- and to be a part of a festival that promotes women in the arts and one that supports female playwrights and artists.

Wilson II,0,1,0,"The Project Gossip Ghouls is the new film from R.J. Wilson Horror, written, directed, and edited by horror microshort filmmaker, R.J. Wilson. Gossip Ghouls is a teen film told in seven parts. The film will be shot like a 90s television show, with references to such programs of the era like Dawson�s Creek, Are You Afraid of the Dark? Goosebumps, and Recess. Because R.J. Wilson Horror creates microshorts, all of the segments will be less than 60 seconds long. The five middle segments will each correspond to one of the five characters, bookended by two full-cast segments. Each character has their own macabre story to tell, and will feature their own unique story. R.J. Wilson has a love for analog; he grew up in the age of video stores and recording your favorite shows onto tape. In essence, the film will appear as though it were stored on VHS. The film is about nostalgia. It�s about memories and storytelling. It�s about coming together, and how when someone says can say �remember when?�, people immediately fall into a trance, with waves of longing, fond memories and homesickness soaring through their body. Outreach/Exhibition Plans Gossip Ghouls is guaranteed distribution through Damnationland, the all-Maine made horror showcase. Every year, Damnationland brings an amassment of audience members to the State Theater in Portland, ME, around Halloween time, as Maine filmmakers set to scare the pants off of them with their content. Additionally, there are always DVDs of the films, as well as soundtracks that feature the music featured in the showcase, which can be found online or at your local Bull Moose. 2019 marks the tenth anniversary since Damnationland opened its doors to local independent filmmakers, and Gossip Ghouls will be opening and closing the program with several segments in between!

Stage credits include Emily Webb in OUR TOWN (Theater at Monmouth, BroadwayWorld's Best Actress in a Play), Emmy in A DOLL�S HOUSE PART 2 (Good Theater), Irina in THREE SISTERS (Fenix Theatre), and Belle/Fred�s Wife in A CHRISTMAS CAROL (Portland Stage).

Joseph Hyland - Director of Photography Joseph Hyland has loved cinema since the age of 10. For this project, he will be pulling a lot of inspiration from his childhood, and his love of the 4:3 box frame. Additionally, he has been watching horror movies non-stop this past year to help bring these seven segments come to life. On the side, Joey also has a passion for making electronic music. Budget The budget is broken down into six departments: Equipment, Food, Art Direction/Costumes, Props (Built), Animation, and Misc. items. The biggest portions of our budget are going to Art Direction/Costumes and Equipment. The reason being we have five main characters and three separate outfits for each of them, as well as six different locations. Some of these costumes we will need to order in time for them to be delivered prior to the shoot. We will be renting Equipment as well, and unfortunately since we are unable to shoot everything in one weekend (there are no scenes at the same location), we will be shooting one day each throughout the summer, meaning, we can't rent all equipment for one weekend; instead, we will have to rent multiple times for each shoot. Food is a huge necessity, as we will need to feed both cast and crew on each of our shoot dates. It's one of the ways we thank everyone for doing their part on set, by giving them a nice hearty meal. There are some scenes that will need built Props and Animation sequences; part of the budget will be going to these departments to gather materials for said sequences. And as for Misc. items, we will be supplying gas to those who have to drive long distances, as well as renting cars for scenes that need them."

This story stars a tiny but powerful little girl, a curious cast of cats, a magical ukulele, and a diverse collection of characters coming together to create a new age fairytale that teaches kids the value of mindfulness, compassion, and acceptance while inspiring them to be the change this world needs. Mindful Mika was deep in meditation... The Message Below the surface this book explores concepts such as meditation, spirit science, harmonics, sacred geometry, yoga, mindfulness, aura alchemy, the chakra system, and how to overcome inherent human flaws that lie in all of us, to become your best self. I hope to equip children with the tools to practice mental and physical wellness promoting positive internal dialogue, higher self-esteem, & healthy lifestyle choices. Meet the Mythic, Mika. �Are you sure of your path?� With great conviction Mika nodded her head, �I am!� In that statement she set her intentions and committed herself mind, body, & soul. The Series Enter Mika (Mee-Kah). A little girl in a very big world. She must travel to the magical kingdom of the Land of Light and become the lands prophesized Mythic. As the Mythic she has been choosen to save the Queen of Quintessence and her Sacred Sages from the cats curse that has been cast upon them by the Empress of Ego. In this nine book series Mika travels through the many worlds of the Land of Light to face the sinful Dark Druids that block her chakras, overcoming them with powers and insight gained from saving the virtuous Sacred Sages. Can Mika save all of the Sages and face the Empress of Ego to rescue the Queen of Quintessence and free the land from the dark curse turning everyone into cats, Mika included, before it�s too late? Suddenly, the storm was upon them... Clinging desperately to her shattered ship, Narci�s wicked cackle trickled through clogged ears like bad reception as a fresh wave of evil energy barreled toward her. Narcissus the Nightmare leered from above dripping in a dark foreboding aura. Narci�s voice was all needles and nails as she shouted, �You don�t stand a chance little girl!� The First Book In the first book of the series, Mythical Mika & The Land of Light, Mika travels from the real world to a surreal dreamlike realm and begins her journey across the Land of Light. Accompanied by her soul guardian, a tiny cat named Spirit, and equipped with a magical ukelele, Mika sets out to bring Light back to the Land, which is quickly fading to darkness as the cats curse spreads. They seek out the sacred sage Lily the Light, keeper of the Oversoul Chakra, who has been transformed into a cat and captured by Narcissus the Nightmare, the first Dark Druid you encounter in the series. Mika must face her greatest fears and learn to recognize that there is nothing to fear but fear itself if she is to save her new companions and become the Mythic the Land of Light so desperately needs to overcome the shadow of ego that is spreading across this once magical paradise. Magic is everywhere, the numbers and shapes will lead you there. Align with the Nine and your true self you will find. The power of the universe in the palm of her hand, she finally understands how to make her stand and save the Land. The Inspiration Mika aims to empower young minds with the ancient knowledge that transcends any one culture of inherent human flaws and the behaviors we can exemplify to overcome these challenges and be our best self. I was inspired by my own journey traveling the world, interacting with a variety of cultures and spiritual beliefs, and exploring knowledge of ancient teachings, sacred geometry, numbers, chakra systems, meditation, mindfulness, enlightenment, the power of now, and ancient lore such as the seven sins & virtues, the emerald tablets, and other various mythologies to create a universal approach to spirituality and morality that can be interpreted openly and enjoyed despite various beliefs and backgrounds. I combine these sacred teachings with a creative and simple style to captivates all ages, heavily influenced by the video game and cartoon culture of my nineties childhood, to bring to life this Iliad for a new age. The time is now my friends, join me in manifesting this dream into a reality. Together we can create a New Age of literature for the next generation. In ages past, when Light first brought Life to this sacred land, a prophecy was written. A prophecy predicting the rise of the Mythic Mika. Mika began to slow as a land of faded beauty manifested before her. Softly she landed amongst the wildflowers, sporting a few new fluffy features of her own. �We have a long journey ahead of us, Mika. We must cross the Sea of Fear & face Narcisuss the Nightmare if we are to save Lily the Light, keeper of the oversoul chakra.� The Plan The vision I hope to manifest with your help is a vibrant fully illustrated children�s tale aimed at kids of all ages, and those eternally young at heart. In pursuit of this dream I have spent the past few years devoting all of my spare time to bringing this world to life. Countless hours of planning and daydreaming eventually gave way to a 64 panel sketched visual storyboard depicting the events in the first book, a first, second and third written draft, a series of watercolor sketches, and a collection of digital illustrations to convey the style and character designs. In addition to having all of the planning completed for the first book in the series, Mythical Mika and The Land of Light, I have outlined the following eight books ensuring the entire series will flow and have a sense of continunity. Your campaign contribution will allow me to devote my full time and attention to creating all 64 illustrations to bring the first book to life as well as writing and editing the final draft before publishing this one of a kind children�s story. Together we can inspire a whole new generation of young minds and teach them how to overcome their own limitations to become a real life hero. Imagine the lasting impacts of empowering the next generation with the knowledge to help save our own world through internal self-awareness, positive actions and personal accountability. Where your pledge is going to bring this story to life. �You are our prophesized Mythic. The one and only Hero who can save our kingdom. As your Spirit, I�ve come to guide you on your journey.� He paused thoughtfully as he sized her up. �I�ll warn you though, The Empress of Ego is no easy foe. Darkness follows wherever she goes.� The Concept Art Below are additional character images I have been experimenting with to capture the overall style that will be used to illustrate my story along with conceptual watercolor sketches created as part of planning the final illustrations necessary for this story. Through extensive planning, dedication, and hard work I hope to achieve magical and dreamy imagery and unique character designs to accompany a poetically written story and capture the imagination of young minds everywhere. Leaning against the far end of the boat, an odd ukulele was calling her name. Spellbound she reached for the instrument and strummed a few chords as they sailed off into the starry night. Magic is in the air. With magic in her heart, Spirit at her side, and the Queen�s dreamsake in hand, Mika felt unstoppable as they sailed into the rising sun. Made of sunsets & moonbeams, the Unity Uke has the power to help Mika bring light back to the land, if only she can learn to Align with the Nine and harness the Magic of Music. Rose the Radiant, the Queen of Quintessence has been captured by the Empress of Ego and trapped in her pure spirit form as a cat. Big hypnotic eyes, unique costume designs, and wild hair colors give life to a simplified style, creating one of a kind visually stimulating character designs. Surreal themed based elements lend a dreamlike quality to the character design. This ensures a diverse and unique cast of characters that will stand out and draw in young readers. Embedded design elements and elegant costumes create a sense of wonder that engages the minds eye. Inspired by our shared world culture, a diverse and inclusive cast of characters allows children from the world over to feel represented in their favorite bedtime story. With sunshine strands and eyes swirling like the seas, she had an air of summer breezes and ice cream dreams. Hidden beneath that layer of sweet serenity she was all spice and firecrackers inside. Mika�s dream encounter with the Queen of Quintessence, Rose the Radiant. Trapped in the cats curse cast upon her by the Empress of Ego, she has used the last of her powers to reach out to Mika through their psychic connection. Drawn to him like a puppet on strings, Mika chases after Spirit as he disappears into the fabled Crystal Caverns. Spirits first encounter with Mika, he discovers her deep in meditation. He�s traveled far from another land seeking a hero to save his kingdom, The Land of Light. Mika try�s to stop Spirit but he�s gone in the blink of the eye. She must decide if she will embrace her fate or let him escape. Mika stumbles into the Crystal Caverns, slipping & tumbling into a portal and falling through an endless void. Mika is a little girl, in a very big world. Little she may be, yet littler still could stop her in her tracks.

Title will be revealed when this reward is unlocked. Come meet the creator!! Find me at my art stand every Saturday in Saxapahaw, NC. The Creator I am a 28-year-old Artist, Writer, & Mother from North Carolina. My biggest inspirations in this life are my small family, my best friend and husband, our perfect two year old little boy River Kai, two huskies, and a pride of five cats. My son is the light of my life, he drives me to be the best version of myself and inspires me to create the change I want to see in the world. Growing up I was a big superhero, video game, and fantasy geek who spent most of my free time locked in my room playing Nintendo games, role playing online, and binge reading fantasy novels. In my early twenties I met my husband, sold all of our stuff, and moved to the Hawaiian islands. I spent several years there exploring my spirituality, receiving particular inspiration from a lost & found copy of Eckhart Tolles The Power of Now. As a team my husband and I spent our free time, while not exploring the boundless natural beauty of the islands, studying a plethora of things from ancient teachings of a variety of cultures that included Egyptian, Vedic, Greek, and even Atlantean teachings, to sacred geometry and the principles of numbers from their effects on a universal level, to their relationships with harmonics and music. We also delved deep into a vast collection of ancient lores, myths, and fairytales to explore the repeated story elements throughout the ages that address the core corruption of humanity when we subcome to our sins and allow the infestation of ego. After our time in Hawaii we spent a few more years traveling before we settled, started a family and bought our first home near the Haw River in North Carolina. I now find myself, as a creator, equipped with all of the tools needed to set out to combine all of these life experiences and insights into one epic nine book story that blends science, magic and spirituality into an adventure packed children�s book. I appreciate you taking the time to check out the campaign, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and I can�t wait to see what we can create together. Aloha from my family to yours."

My sister, Sarah, and I are fledgling ceramicists living in Austin, Texas. We began working with clay in earnest a little over a year ago. Since then, our enthusiasm (or is it obsession?) has grown tremendously. Ceramic feather holder Hand painted bowl WHY WE NEED A KILN As with most artistic pursuits, a huge part of the journey is practice. We need to make A LOT of pots. That means we have to fire A LOT of pots. Right now we are firing our work at a community studio, but that option is not ideal. It�s slow. It�s expensive, and we aren�t learning anything by letting someone else perform that part of the process. OUR KILN STORY As luck would have it, my neighbor Melanie Schopper, an established ceramics artist, was moving her long-tone studio and offered to share her kiln with us by moving it into my garage. This is the perfect opportunity for us to have access to a kiln and to learn from someone who really knows their stuff. OUR $$ GOAL The kiln has been moved in but we will need to install a special electrical outlet before we can get it up and running. That�s where you come in. We need to raise $1079 to have the outlet installed. GET SOME POTS!! Being novice ceramicists we know that we can�t offer the same professional level of work as master artists, but we can offer our own personal touch and unique creative style. For every donation made we will create a one-of-a-kind piece JUST for you. Hand shaped pendant necklaces Sgraffito Mug Moon baby wall pocket CUSTOM WORK You can let us choose the color and theme for your piece or make a special request along with your donation.

Hello, everybody! I'm Josh, and welcome to the kickstarter for my new art-book, ""IMAGINE."" Some of you might already know me from instagram as LOBSTERSQUIRREL where I post all kinds of sketches, daily doodles and illustrations using the Procreate app on an iPad pro. Outside of that, I work a full-time job as a storyboard artist in the animation industry with past credits on, Marvel entertainment's Avengers assemble and Black Panther's Quest, and currently, I'm working at Dreamworks animation on the new Fast and Furious animated TV show. ABOUT THE BOOK. My plans for the book are simple! I thought I'd take the hundreds of sketches and illustrations I've done over the past couple of years and pack them all into one book and share them with everybody. You'll find a wide range of work from character design, environments, backgrounds, fan art and full step by step break-downs from rough sketches to line art, and fully colored pieces. The book will also include some never before seen artwork! The book itself will be a perfect bound soft cover with 128, full color pages, and will measure 11"" W x 8.5"" T. SAMPLE PAGES A quick look at what you'll find in, ""IMAGINE."" - Step by step processes, fan art... Character design... Environment and background illustrations, and more!

As a homesick teenager working in France, her courage and energy inspired me so deeply I was compelled to write home to Ireland and tell my biggest fan, my Dad, that I finally knew for certain what I wanted to do with my life. �It won�t be an easy life� he wrote back, but the die was already cast. I had no idea the emotional roller-coaster path my life would take. Many times I felt the price I was paying to pursue my passion was too much and I often wanted to scream �I can�t do this anymore, I give up�, but the Irish blood that runs in my veins doesn�t know how to quit and the love I have for it grows ever stronger. Music has always inspired me. It�s the ultimate healer, the ultimate connector, the universal language that bridges all cultures. It speaks to our souls in the most deeply personal of tongues, it lifts us in our sorrow and animates us in our joy. Making music that resonates with others has been my lifelong passion. But the world has changed since I first picked up a guitar and sang. Even the record labels I aspired to be a part of no longer exist. Technology has wiped out the dreams of most of my kind, but it has opened the door to those who are willing to adapt, to evolve their craft and to take risks. I need you all to be my record company now. I�ve left my family (again) and emigrated to my spiritual home, America, determined to prove to myself that when you love what you do, all dreams are possible. If my journey thus far has prepared me for anything � it has prepared me for the risk I am about to take. Thanks to John Bush & Matt Hubbard of (Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians) , I�ve made an album very personal to me. It reflects the journey I�ve been privileged to take, it reflects the people who came into my life who helped me over hurdles I thought would sink me, it reflects the desire in all of us to leave our own personal mark on the world. It�s my song to those of you who are struggling to find your path in a world that often seems indifferent, it�s my urging to you to never give up. It�s me, with all my insecurities, all my fears and all my hopes, and I�m placing it in your hands � with all my love and trust. I don�t know how Kickstarter works, but I know how love does, and I know that the more you spend it the greater it gets. It�s why I called the album ""You Can�t Run Out Of Love"". I've launched this Kickstarter Campaign to raise funds to promote the album, to maximize its chances of getting to those who can be lifted by it, to give it a fighting chance in a noisy world. Will you help me do what I have to do to promote this album? It�s made, it�s pressed, it�s ready to go. Here's a breakdown of the costs: I believe we are all born to create, it might get knocked out of us through life, but it always calls us and we can choose to do something about our burning desires or ignore it. The ball is always in your court. I believe these new songs are a form of healing and everyone needs some sort of healing. We're not broken but we don't mind a little WD-40 every now and then... :-) Will you help me FIND MY AUDIENCE for this record? Thank you all, XOXOX"

When we exceed our funding goal (little mini manifestation there) there of course will be stretch goals! Right now the decks are packaged with shrink-wrap, however, exceeding the goal will allow for fun upgrades like boxes and tins to store your decks in! Who knows, maybe a little citrine crystal cluster to manifest prosperity in your life is a better stretch goal reward! When the times comes to decide, I will send out a survey and find an upgrade you guys are excited about!

We've reached our minimum goal thanks to your support! We remain optimistic of meeting our stretch goal of $17,300, to cover long overdue repairs and improvements for Meleana, our solar-powered mobile studio. Before elaborating there, we uploaded our completed video project - see our NEW main campaign video above! Were able to pay all outstanding bills, and most importantly, it turned out to be an amazing end product. Please enjoy what your generosity made possible. Stretch goal: The majority of funds raised beyond our minimum goal would go toward long overdue repairs and improvements to Meleana, our solar-powered mobile studio. A minority would go toward higher than anticipated event costs. Built from a refurbished 76 Airstream trailer, Meleana serves as a classroom on wheels for our youth across our partner schools. Meleanas high-end, industry-standard equipment, along with many of Hawaiis top musicians, engineers and videographers - whom we refer to as the Mana Maoli Collective, also provide fee-for-service offerings to individuals, businesses and other nonprofits, as a means to feed our programs, while providing our youth a real-world internship and learning environment. ====== Be a Part of Something BIG, meaningful and inspiring. We're working on a new video project and we invite you to join us. 1000 youth, artists & collaborators across 4 islands & 14 schools will re-imagine an iconic song of universal resonance. Our 1st 2 collaborations with Playing for Change surpassed 15 million views, yet we feel this next one is our most powerful piece yet! Before its worldwide premiere, the video will be shown at an unprecedented Hoomau & Mana Mele joint concert at Victoria Ward Park. featuring youth from 26 Hawaiian immersion & charter schools across 3 islands, and an all-star lineup of artists featured in the video. The trailer video shown above is a sneak peek of what we're working on now. This is a project under THE MANA MELE PROGRAM, the experience that's better seen, heard, and felt. The series of videos below produced by students, college interns, and Mana Maoli Collective industry pros provides background on this program. Who We Are Mana Maoli�s vision is to facilitate individual and community healing and empowerment by fostering lifelong learners who think, feel, and act in ways that are pono (harmonious, righteous). We serve Hawaii�s youth by giving them opportunities to perpetuate and evolve cultural practices as they adapt to and embrace the modern world. Our current primary focus is the Mana Mele Program, which teaches ABCs - Academics, Business, Culture - through its Music/Multimedia Academy, Meleana, and over 200 musicians, engineers and videographers of the Mana Maoli Collective. Within the past year, the Mana Mele Program delivered the following results: 42,177 Student Contact Hours 2051 student participants 105 mentors engaged 400 students received college/career readiness services 111 Knowledge Resource Products produced 46 live events at schools and in the community OUR CURRENT PROJECT - VIDEO PREMIERE: HONOLULU & WORLDWIDE We're gearing up for a highly anticipated video & host a community event that brings together youth, leaders, and music & multimedia industry professionals to pay homage to the rich culture and history of Hawai�i. When students join us in creating music videos and performing at our concerts, it serves as a platform for them to hike, or demonstrate, application of their learning in real world settings. Their acquired skills contribute to a product that is shared with the world. While we have successfully secured the vast majority of funds needed for this video and premiere event project, reaching our minimum goal of $7,800 is needed to cover final post-production expenses below. Any funds raised in excess of $7,800 will be used for long overdue repairs and improvements to Meleana, our solar-mobile studio, to continue to be able to do projects like this one, as youth learn from the process in a real-world setting.

We're proud to present the brand new Point 65 KingFisher, the world's first modular trimaran fishing kayak. We wanted to make owning a fishing kayak easy. A kayak that can take you anywhere - regardless of how much space or strength you have to store and carry it. A kayak that�s as easy to handle outside the water as it is on it. Modular kayaks can go places most kayaks can�t. The two halves of the KingFisher snap apart in seconds and easily fit into your car, apartment or even as checked-in luggage on an airplane. Plus, half a kayak is twice as easy to carry! One person can easily load, unload and assemble the KingFisher. No roof-racks or storage space? No problem! The KingFisher�s flexibility doesn�t stop with its modular design. You have the choice of using your legs, arms, or motor to get where you want to go. The slender hull design makes for smooth, effortless paddle strokes if you want to go the old-fashioned route. The optional Impulse Drive is ready and waiting when you need your hands free, using the power of your legs to propel you forward or backward. Steering is a breeze with our handy rudder controls and you can fit almost any motor to the KingFisher's aft deck. A fishing kayak that still feels like a kayak. This beautifully designed boat melts into the natural surroundings. No disturbing wake, no loud noises or smelly motor fumes. Feel relaxed as you paddle, sit, stand, and fish. All with complete confidence in the KingFisher to support your weight and movements. With multiple settings & heights, the Game Chair adjusts to you - not the other way round. Perfect for when you�re patiently waiting for the next bite, setting up your line, or wrangling your latest catch! This boat is decked out with everything you need to have the best possible fishing experience. Multiple Rod Parks, super-comfy adjustable Game Chair, two spacious storage hatches and plenty of compatible attachment rails and bars for anything else you want to add on top. All of our kayaks are made from high quality, durable, moulded HTP plastics free from harmful chemicals and dyes. The material used is 100% recyclable, and all manufacturing remnants (like cut out hatches) are recycled. We put every model through extensive durability testing to make a product that will last through many adventures. And, thanks to our 'modular' spare parts design system, if any piece gets damaged or broken, you can easily replace an individual part instead of scrapping your entire kayak. When designing the KingFisher, we set out to tackle the biggest challenges of owning a fishing kayak. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

The optional ImpulseDrive easily pops into its slot in the KingFisher kayak and effectively propels you forward and backward using leg power. The pedal drive unit is extremely light-weight and is one of the few pedal-driven units on the market that can be driven both forward - and in reverse. With your largest muscle group in play, kayak fishing becomes easier and more efficient than ever. The Impulse Drive is a revolutionary pedal-drive system designed around a very simple premise: if a product is designed to be used in the water it should be 100% corrosion proof. Featuring a high performance encased shaft drive design, that is immune to water damage, the Impulse Drive will not corrode or degrade in water. Not only does this design dramatically reduce wear but it also provides a high performance system that is 100% user serviceable. The Impulse Drive is incredibly versatile for the retailer and end user. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

A conventional monohull must balance conflicting needs of resistance and stability. You want a narrow, skinny hull to reduce resistance and paddling effort, but you need a wide hull to maintain vessel stability and keep the kayak upright. The trimaran separates these two design requirements by using three strategically-placed hulls to maximize stability but keep the overall width to a minimum. Primarily, trimarans deliver stability in a very power efficient package. In order to maintain the same stability in a regular monohull kayak, the hull width must be wider. A wider hull makes the kayak awkward and cumbersome to paddle, adds extra weight, and significantly decreases portability. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Multiple marine grade, aluminum attachment rails are fitted along the KingFisher allowing for maximum flexibility for how you would like to customize your kayak. The front, middle and rear sections have rails along both sides, and can fit RAM, Scotty, or other accessories securely. Flush-mounted rod holders are located on either side of the Kingfisher, with integrated rod-holder recesses and rod-tip protectors. You can relax knowing your rods will be held in place while you paddle, pedal or motor through the water. The KingFisher has well-placed, generous storage space for all your gear. Below the Game Chair, you'll find space for your tackle boxes for easy access. There are front and rear hatches with a removable liner for equipment, battery packs, etc. There is also a rear cargo area with secure bungees and floor-mounted aluminum rails. The super efficient, hand-controlled twin rudders help you maneuver your KingFisher with ease and precision. The dual steering handles with fingertip control are located on either side of the Game Chair, and the rudders can be locked in place to give you more options for steering.

The Ratio Six is the coffee maker you've been waiting for. I'm a coffee equipment nerd, and this is what I've been working on for 3 years. I started Clive Coffee 10 years ago that imports customized, high quality, and expensive espresso machines directly from Italy. Why should espresso enthusiasts be the only ones with great looking equipment, I wondered? The Ratio Six is my attempt to offer an incredibly easy-to-use, beautiful-to-behold, pleasure-to-own coffee maker, at a price point that more people can afford. Coffee matters. It can provide the basis of a quiet bit of solitude to start your day, or a drink to share with a new friend, or a finale to a great dinner with those you love. Let Ratio brew amazing coffee for whatever you're doing with your time! -Mark Hellweg, Ratio founder One Button Simplicity. Simplify your coffee routine to the touch of a button. The Ratio Six�s Bloom, Brew, and Ready phases run in sequence, delivering a perfect (and easy) cup of coffee every time. Love pour over brewed by a skilled barista? So do we. But sometimes you need to *quickly* make great coffee. Ratio will handle the extraction for you. Just add cold water and freshly ground coffee. Delicious, Perfectly Extracted Coffee. For Everyone. Our coffee machines are used by Top Chef champions and coffee professionals. You can find the Ratio Eight in Palm Springs resort suites and in tiny coastal restaurants producing 15 course dinners reviewed by the New York Times. We wanted to expand the availability of great coffee, and the Six offers trusted coffee best practices in a more affordable format. The Ratio Six emulates a skilled barista pour over process, precisely metering water flow through both the Bloom and Brew phases. All of the taste. None of the work. Trusted by those with great palates. Fibonacci Spiral Shower Head & Bloom After the button is pressed, Ratio gets to work on brewing great coffee. First, the powerful heating element sends hot water bubbling up through handblown glass supply lines to the stainless steel spiral shower head. Water is distributed over the ground coffee, causing a bubbly interaction called a �bloom.� The control board allows the Bloom to settle before delivering the rest of the hot water, slowly, near the ideal temperature (200�). The result? More evenly extracted grounds and a more amazing cup of coffee. Designed for today. And tomorrow. We designed the Ratio Six for longevity with precision formed stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and high end BPA-free copolymers. Every inch is built to last and covered by a 5-year warranty. Compact Size, Full Performance The Six will fit in most kitchens without taking up too much countertop real estate. Flexible Brewing The Ratio Six ships with a thermal carafe designed for flat-bottom basket coffee filters. Prefer a conical filter? You can also use the Ratio Eight Thermal Carafe or Glass Carafe with a Chemex paper filter or stainless steel reusable Ratio Kone. Both the Ratio Six and Eight have the same brewing capacity (1.3 liters / 40 ounces). Read all the details on the Ratio Eight versus the Six. Modern Quality, 5 Year Warranty There are coffee machines that make great coffee, and there are coffee machines that look great. Ratio Six is both, combining form and function. Designed in Portland, Oregon, every Ratio machine is meticulously assembled by hand from components we manufacture with our overseas partner. While common appliances often have a built-in obsolescence and 1-3 year life span, every Ratio is built to last and covered by a 5-year limited warranty. Technical, Yet Simple All of the features you need, with nothing that will clutter up your routine or provide too many options when you just want a cup of great coffee.

Intake works by allowing you to breathe through your nose even at increased heart rates, unlocking a physiological process that helps your body build strength and increase resilience--even in the face of the most challenging training regimens. We know this sounds like too small of a change to make such a big difference, but we�re not the only ones who are getting behind nose breathing �its benefits are being talked about from the Washington Post to the New York Times to the Joe Rogan Podcast. Because you�re breathing more efficiently, you�ll be performing more efficiently, whether you�re a hardcore athlete or someone who just wants to give their body the best edge it can get. From cycling to yoga to weightlifting to running, Intake will be your most steadfast training partner. Traditional nasal strips can't compare to the Intake Band. Intake opens your nasal passages far wider than nasal strips, stays on through sweaty exercise, and doesn't collapse upon inhale. See the rest of these testimonials and others at the bottom in �Testimonials from GEN 1 Users�. Seen enough? CLICK HERE to be among the first people to get our new breathing device! Clean each side of your nose with an included alcohol wipe to remove any dirt or oils from the skin. Using the applicator, apply one adhesive tab to each nostril just above the pinch point. Press the edges of the tab into your skin. Apply the Intake band over your nose. The magnetic ends of the band will �click� into the tabs, opening your nose. Unlike some campaigns, we don't aim to make money on your shipping fees. By calculating shipping after the campaign is over, you save up to 30% on shipping fees. Shipping charges above are estimates. Final shipping charges will appear on the post-campaign survey and may vary slightly from these estimates. US estimates apply to the lower 48 contiguous states only. Alaska/Hawaii shipping is charged at �Rest of World� level. �Rest of World� prices are an estimated range. There�s sort of a biological catch-22 when it comes to nasal vs. oral breathing Generally speaking, our noses are more efficient breathing machines than our mouths. When you breathe through your nose, you�re able to pull oxygen into all five lobes of the lungs, whereas your mouth can only pull oxygen to the two uppermost lobes. This act of fully stimulating the lungs has a positive domino effect on the body, ultimately boosting blood flow and helping protect organs and muscles from damage. Here comes the catch: During increased heart rates, our noses physically can�t inhale quickly enough to deliver air at the rate our bodies need. So, we rely on breathing through our mouths, which can deliver the requisite amount of oxygen, but can�t create the positive domino effect achieved through nose breathing. In fact, chronic mouth breathing actively hinders physical performance and recovery. Sounds like a problem, right? That�s where Intake comes in. The Intake band keeps your nasal passage ways open at their widest capacity, allowing you access to deep breathing like never before. Intake ensures not only that you�re getting the most out of your workout, but that your body has full access to the processes it needs to be at its absolute best. DEHYDRATING and IRRITATING - Your mouth can�t filter air the same way your nose can, so the air you take in orally can cause inflammation in your lungs and throat. Exhaling through your mouth can also contribute to whole body dehydration, as water molecules leave your body more rapidly: you can see this on cold days, when the temperature makes the water vapor visible. UPSETS BLOOD PH - Nasal breathing balances CO2 levels in the bloodstream, which helps to keep the pH of our blood in its proper range. Mouth breathing decreases CO2 level, which in turn makes blood too alkaline. CAUSES PERPETUAL STRESS-STATE - Breathing through your mouth causes hyperventilation, which triggers the sympathetic nervous system and activates our fight-or-flight response. When this side of our nervous system is activated, our focus drops and our stress response goes up, contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression--despite the endorphins exercise can stimulate. INCREASE NITRIC OXIDE - Nitric Oxide is formed in the nasal cavity, and it�s vital to your body�s function. It�s a vasodilator, which means it allows your blood vessels to relax so that blood flow increases and your body is able to deliver more oxygen to your muscles and organs. This means optimal endurance and stamina, and faster recovery. BOOST COGNITIVE FUNCTION - Nasal breathing stimulates the amygdala and hippocampus, balancing your mood and improving short term memory and focus. It also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with feelings of centeredness and relaxation. MAINTAIN HEALTH - Breathing exclusively through your nose protects your immune system in two ways: your nose filters particulates and humidifies the air reaching your lungs, which cuts down on inflammation, and the nitric oxide in your sinus cavity acts as an antimicrobial, helping to inhibit pathogen growth before it can enter your body. Most of our users are professional athletes--but you don�t have to be to benefit from Intake. We�re not. We�re just regular humans who wanted to feel good when we were going for a jog or winding down with a yin yoga class. The solution we found works so well that we want you to have access to it too, whether you�re an Olympic trainee or a desk jockey or somewhere in between. The idea behind Intake is simple: if you can breathe your best, you can be your best, no matter where you are. The hours you spend recharging are just as important as the ones you spend up and running�if not more. While we designed Intake for high impact activity, many of our test phase users have also used Intake for sleep, and have reported feeling more rested and energized upon waking. Deepen your sleep, cut down on snoring, and utilize your breathing like never before. After over a year of development and testing we are excited to offer the new and improved Intake Breathing System to Kickstarter FIRST! The improvements to the Intake Sport Band: New contours for increased comfort & fit across the bridge of the nose New softer edges for additional comfort against the skin Even radius for custom printing capabilities Changes in Intake Tabs: New method of manufacturing for minimal exposure of adhesive to air for better adhesion. New pull tabs for easier application New sweat channel to expel sweat built up under the steal disk The Intake Band comes in sizes Small, Medium, and Large, and the sizing is determined by the width of your nose. We�ve designed the range to be fairly universal�if you�re of average size, a Medium is a good place to start. Based on our test phase users, we typically recommend a small for kids and teens, a medium for women, and medium or large for men. Here�s where it gets a little more complex: if you�re wearing Intake for high-impact activity, or in a sport that requires goggles or a faceplate, we recommend sizing down. A smaller size band will create less pull on the adhesive tabs, making the band more likely to stay put. If you�ll primarily be using Intake for sleep or lower-impact activities (for instance, a moderate gym set), we recommend choosing your normal size or even sizing up�the larger sized bands are less convex, meaning they�ll pull your nostrils open wider and allow greater airflow. However, this also means they�ll pull harder on the adhesive tabs, meaning you�ll potentially get less run time out of the tabs. We get it: this is kind of a weird product. Before we started Intake, we�d all heard about the benefits of breathing through your nose, but we�d likened it to eating broccoli: good for you, but weird to do all the time. Well, we�re here now to tell you that nasal breathing is both good for you and decidedly not weird to do all the time. Actually, it�s pretty incredible So, we�re launching a Kickstarter campaign because we think this product--while humble--is truly revolutionary, and we want to share it with you. Through our research and test phases, we�ve realized that having a little help breathing through your nose can radically improve your athletic endurance, your recovery, your mental aptitude, and your mood. Our Kickstarter target is to raise enough money to make our production process more efficient. With support from our backers, we�ll be able to increase both the accessibility and affordability of Intake, and be able to develop different product models for our increasingly diverse customer base. The faster we�re able to adapt to accommodate our growing market, the more people we will be able to help. Ultimately, this all boils down to one single, driving force: we want to help you breathe your best, because that means you can be your best. Just try it for yourself. You�ll feel the difference.

Whats really great about it is that no matter what you need it for, its versatile enough for everyone. This all really began out of my need as a photographer and motorcycle rider, to have the proper travel and carrying cases for my important equipment. I needed something that was strong enough to protect my gear while I was busy trying not to break it, or myself. I love traveling, so if Im not doing that on my bike, Im on my way to somewhere cool where Im taking photos. I wanted a bag that was versatile enough for all of that. Like most photographers that ride you want your camera at the ready. Not packed deep inside your luggage. Riding with a backpack on for long periods of time can be tiring and fatigue your back, so having the option to place it on your motorcycle tank or strap it to the back of your bike is great. Ive really tested this bag out, riding with it, traveling, carrying it around. It works! Its also my perfect carry on bag for flying. Fitting perfectly under the planes seat. Whether Im on one of my own bikes or renting one on a trip, packing can be kind of a challenge. Lets face it..packing in general is a challenge, with or without a bike. I wanted to make that easier for people. I want it to be an easy decision for anyone, from a professional photographer, to a new rider, to anyone itching to go get out and travel. If you are wearing it as a backpack, or its on your bike, its ready to grab and go, and right there when you get to your destination. | THE TRIPLE THREAT BAG | Tank Bag | Backpack | Camera Bag Padded inside with extra space for storing all sort of things�ipads, kindle, snacks, passport Outside has backpack straps that can be hidden when you don't want them out.

A hack that does what I always wished the game would do, that changes or discards the bits and pieces that always rubbed me the wrong way, while not overly complicating things and still delivering the same classic dungeon-crawler experience I�ve loved since I was a kid. Don�t get me wrong: I�ve enjoyed the game for over twenty years. I wouldn�t have kept playing it and writing about it if I didn�t. But everyone has their issues with it, everyone cooks up their own homebrew rules whether or not they end up using them at the table, or even bothering to fully flesh them out. I just ended up with enough that I felt collectively it justified a new game. People have described it as a more customizable-yet-simpler take on 5th Edition, something between 3rd and 5th Edition, and even a kind of modernized B/X or Rules Cyclopedia. Pretty much everyone agrees it fits the old-school aesthetic, which is good because it was intended to be a kind of homage to the ""easy to master black box"" that I grew up on. If you want to check out Black Book, you can snag it over on DriveThruRPG by going here (or get it as an Add-On: see below). You can also check out a quick-start version of the rules and content by clicking here (this incorporates some of the changes that will be going into Red Book). It's a direct Google Drive link, so you'll just need to click and download, no other steps necessary! Here are some other links if you want to dig even deeper: You can find a bunch of blog posts about design and how it's changed over time, as well as countless play reports, here. An interview with the folks from Game School TSR Podcast: Several reviews for Black Book: Mark Craddock (Cross Planes) Jeremy ""Frothsof"" Smith (Thought Eater) Niklas Skinner (Skinner Games) The RPG Crawler Not an interview or anything, but this guy Will ""BilliamBabble Meddis"" seems to dig it, too. Red Book takes all of the things that worked in Black Book and Appendix D and GREATLY expands upon and refines them. Black Book was 141 pages, Red Book is nearly 600. It's got more of the stuff that you love: races, classes (and talents for each), alchemical items, magic items, monsters, treasure, tables to speed things up, etc. It's like comparing a Starter Set to something like Rules Cyclopedia. Just to be clear: virtually everything in Black Book (and the Appendix D supplement) is in Red Book. Some mechanics or minor elements might have been scrapped, others changed, but for the most part it's all been ported over to Red Book (it might also be worded differently). This is intended to be a stand-alone RPG that doesn't require Black Book (or Appendix D) at all. Here's a rundown of the big things that help distinguish Dungeons & Delvers from the game(s) that inspired it: Ability scores are just modifiers. You don't have a Strength score of 14, with a modifier of +2. You just have the +2. You can roll stats, which requires you to reference a table, but it uses old-school modifier ranges so an 18 nets you a +3 instead of the +4 you'd get in later editions. There's very little number scaling. Some editions of the World's First Roleplaying Game had a lot of assumed math and wealth progression, especially 3rd and 4th. In Dungeons & Delvers there is some scaling, to the tune of about +1 every five levels. Monsters and task difficulties aren't built around this however, so you can better experiment without fretting much about your stats. Hit Points are split into Wound and Vitality Points. Wound Points (WP) represents more severe injuries, or ""meat points"". As such it recovers very slowly. Vitality Points (VP) represent fatigue and minor injuries. It replenishes much more quickly, at first with a quick rest, but over the course of the adventuring day it takes longer and longer. Armor provides both an AC bonus and Damage Resistance, so even if an attack connects it can absorb some of the damage. Beware though: some attacks like poisonous gas or a ghost's life-draining touch can penetrate your armor's DR, or even bypass it entirely! You can, for the most part, control how complicated your character gets. Whether you're a fighter or wizard most characters start pretty darn simple, and depending on what you want to do can remain simple. You can also shift gears as you play, choosing more complex stuff later on (and vice versa). Most classes have their own spellcasting mechanics. There's no pseudo-Vancian magic. This wasn't done for it's own sake as a gimmick or anything like that, but rather to make sure the mechanics for certain classes evoke a specific tone and feel (wizard magic is more dangerous and unpredictable, cleric magic is completely safe), that they build on the flavor so it all makes sense ""in-game"". Simple, Useful, and Robust Crafting: Making something is a snap: make sure you have the relevant crafting skill, make sure you have the item's cost in materials, and make sure you have the time. That's it. No rolling necessary.While there are a bunch of examples in the book, the rules are also open-ended, allowing players to try making their own unique items out of strange materials they discover. Fresh Takes on Classic Monsters: As we stat out monsters, we've been looking at the flavor behind them, deviating from the default where we think it'll make things more interesting. For example, kobolds are based on Germanic spirits (and a core PC race, effectively replacing halflings), and ghouls are demonic creatures with the ability to change their shape and steal the face of a creature they have eaten. Piercers don't just fall on you: they gather in clusters, and spray a paralyzing acid on anything that gets close, before using long proboscis to slurp up the remains. Some monsters look similar enough but have different abilities or flavor surrounding them, like gnolls: they look like classic gnolls but have more in common with the wendigo. Fresh Takes From Classic Monsters: Not every monster hoards treasure, but that's not a big deal since many monsters have useful bits you can harvest from them. These can be sold or traded, or used to make equipment. As it stands almost all of the text is done. There's about...1d4+2% left to go, but the primary purpose of this Kickstarter is so we can more easily set aside the time to finish the staggering amount of art it still demands! People love our art. It's been a defining trait since our Dungeon World class-creating roots. We've gotten better and faster over the years, but it can still take a lot of time and we don't like to skimp. The Black Book edition was 141 pages and boasted an impressive 58 illustrations. Red Book has greatly exceeded the 500-page mark, which will require a substantially greater amount of art. The current ballpark number is 100 new illustrations. Here's some samples of our art, so you can get idea of the style and quality: And while that's all going on we're also going to incrementally share content documents with you, the backers, giving everyone a chance to chime in, provide feedback and suggestions. This way we can better iron out kinks, make the system as airtight as possible so we ideally will never need to do another ""edition"" down the road. We really want to focus on new settings and adventures, but want a more finalize system before doing all that. The secondary purpose is to pay Chris for editing and proofreading. First things first, backers will not only be able to get their mitts on content sooner than later, they'll also get the PDFs and/or physical copies cheaper that what it'll cost once published, to the tune of about $5-10. Second, as already mentioned, the book is nearing the 600-page count, but that's just for a single-volume, digest-sized book. Sounds impressive, but we know some people prefer letter-sized books (8.5 x 11), and others might prefer to have the digest-sized book divvied up a bit, so we're making it available in three different formats: Not final cover. Page numbers subject to change, especially if stretch goals are met. The two digest-sized books will be divided into a player and GM book. We considered doing three (player, GM, and monsters), but the GM book would have been really small. This way they're more evenly matched in size. The letter-sized book will have a two-column per page layout. I should note that if you pledge for multiple books they can be in different formats. For example, if you want a color and B&W book, the color can be letter-sized, while the B&W can be a pair of digest books. Mix and match them however you like! Everyone that backs at the Wanderer level or higher will get PDFs for every format, in both B&W and in color: you don't need to choose. We're very open to suggestions, and if people want we could also do ""art-free"" and a version without a background page texture. Your name will also be added to a Kickstarter Backer section at the back of the book. Higher pledge levels (Explorer and up) net you a physical book. You choose what size of a book you want, and if you want a digest-sized book whether you want it in one or two books. Once the books are nearing completion, we'll send out a survey asking you how you want your book, and when they are ready send you a print-on-demand (POD) link. How that works is, once the book is finished and we get a suitable proof back from DriveThruRPG, we send out the POD links. These let you get a book from DriveThruRPG ""at cost"", as in they bare minimum they charge to print it: we don't receive any money from those, it all goes to DriveThru to pay for the books. If you want additional books, see the Add-Ons section, below. Since DriveThruRPG has print-on-demand facilities in America and Europe, in most cases this should keep shipping and handling costs at a minimum. The Immortal pledge level is different. For that we print the book and mail it out ourselves; since shipping and handling costs can change dramatically we'll have to wait to figure that out later. Just something to keep in mind, especially if you live in another country. If you want additional books, simply increase your pledge as follows for each additional book you want (required pledge levels are mentioned in parenthesis): B&W Softcover (Wanderer or higher) +$15 B&W Hardcover (Adventurer, Veteran, Hero, or Immortal) +$20 Color Softcover (any tier with a color softcover or color hardcover ) +$20 Color Hardcover (any tier with a color hardcover) +$30 There are no limits, just keep in mind that although DriveThru will package them together (up to a point, anyway) S&H might increase. Once the campaign is over we'll send out an email survey asking you which add-ons you want, and how many (as well as sizes in case you want both digest- and letter-sized books, or one big digest book and a pair of smaller ones). One other thing is that for the duration of the campaign, you can also pick up other Dungeons & Delvers products at a discount: Black Book +$4 Appendix D +$4 Krampus Run +$1 Escape From the Flesh Catacombs +$3 Delver #1 +$3 Dungeons & Delvers (Dice Pool/Chibi Version) +$6 Dungeons & Delvers: Red Book GM Screen +$5 One-Page Dungeons +$1 for each (5 in total) Dungeons & Delvers: Red Book Paper Minis +$5 You can get more information about all of those except the GM screen, one-page dungeons, and paper minis (we haven't made them yet) by going here. These prices are for both PDFs and at-cost print-on-demand if you want a physical version, just keep in mind that you'll need to pay the print cost and S&H as well. These will be sent out as soon as the campaign is over, in case you want to try out a more basic version of the game sooner than later. Note that you will not need Black Book or Appendix D to use Red Book: it will be completely stand-alone, and include most, if not all of the content from both books. It's really only if you want to try out the game sooner, and at a discount. If we exceed the initial goal, more loot will be obtained! UNLOCKED! Though the book will already be profusely illustrated, at this amount we'll be adding even more art: most if not all monsters will get illustrated, and we'll fill in most of the blank spaces with smaller bits of art. In addition, every backer will receive the art as individual images (300dpi, multiple formats): you can use them in personal or commercial projects, no limits! UNLOCKED! We were holding back on the wizard due to the sheer number of spell talents it already gets (which in turn were justified by all the bonus talents it also gets), but at this level we'll cram in the Conjurer talents we've cooked up, plus the Conjurer Talent chart! UNLOCKED! As with the Conjurer School, the cleric already had a bunch of talents. Not as many but then it doesn't get any bonus talents. At these level we'll add them to the mix. UNLOCKED! We were thinking of saving the Greek monsters for an issue of Delver, or a Greek campaign setting so everything would be in a single thematic book. At this level we'll at least put the classics in Red Book, and won't reprint them later, instead sticking to the more esoteric stuff, plus a bunch of variants and original stuff we've cooked up. Back in my day, race was your class! You played a dwarf or elf and liked it! At this level we won't replace races with classes, but make it an optional thing you can choose. You'll be able to multiclass between a racial class and a standard class, too, so you can decided just how dwarfy or elfy you want to be! Something we whipped up for the Game Science Podcast interview: players find an odd, seemingly abandoned tower in the wilderness, and quickly learn that a bunch of really nasty shit went down. It's mostly done, and we were going to publish it standalone, but at this level we'll stick it in the back so you'll have an adventure ready to go after whipping up your first batch of characters! David Guyll has been gaming for well over 20 years, cutting his teeth on the Easy-to-Master D&D ""black box"" (the one with Zanzer Tem's dungeon), before soon moving on to 2nd Edition. He�s maintained the roleplaying game-centric Points of Light blog for over ten years, where he reviews games, posts play reports, talks about games, adventure and game design, and features a bunch of homebrewed content. Melissa Guyll has been playing tabletop RPGs since meeting David one fateful day after being enticed by a plate of bacon and chocolate cake. Her history with RPGs didn't start there. Since she was in elementary school and took hold of a Nintendo controller she found a love for playing video games, RPGs being her go-to genre. When she's not being a nerd or coloring David's amazing art, she's also a mom, chicken herder, and gardener. Starting way back in 2013 they have labored to publish a collection of class powers and magic items for Dungeons & Dragons, as well as several adventures, numerous classes, a half-dozen magic item collections, and an original, unconventional campaign setting for Dungeon World. They've since expanded to publishing their own stand-alone roleplaying games, though still produce the occasional third-party product. They enjoy helping other creators with their work when they can, offering advice and providing inexpensive, sometimes free services and art. Chris started playing RPGs in 1980 and was hooked when after 2 hours of working on first character he died in first encounter (RIP forgotten named elf character). Chris went on to get his revenge with his second character and spent most of his youth with RPGs somewhere in the background. Always tinkering and coming up with house rules, characters, and adventures, from both a player and GM side. After high school Chris went on to join the Navy and became a pirate for God and country, where he learned the skills required for good QA work in a Submarine Engine Room. Afterwards going to art school to be a comic artist and eventually becoming an art/design director for the last twenty years at a promotional design firm. Red Book is his first adventure into being on a RPG team. His sword and pack are ready. Melissa and I delivered the PDF of A Sundered World over a month early. The print copies took longer, as it took us several tries to get the cover looking right but we've gotten better at predicting the results of DriveThru's print-on-demand service. We were also ordering them during the holidays, which probably caused them to take longer to arrive.We didn't bother running a Kickstarter campaign until the book was nearly complete, leaving us with pretty much just the art to worry about. That that's the same deal, here: text is mostly done, it's really a matter of cranking out the art. We also kept in constant contact with the backers, providing them with access to easily digestible Google documents, so they could offer feedback and suggestions while we toiled away on the art. We're also incredibly easy to get in touch with directly if needed."

We showcase and support filmmakers who explore the art of the moving image including works that represent experimental narratives, genre-expanding documentary, contemporary art practices, and avant-garde poetics. We screen short film and video works that stretch the notion of what the moving image is and can be. The 2019 Ae Film Festival will take place August 28th and 29th at Minneapolis' Trylon Cinema. The Trylon is known for showing unique film selections and features newly remodeled, accessible spaces and seating. Still from 2018 Audience Award Winner, Thursday's Child, by Maret Polzine We are entering our 6th season with our new Festival Director, Molly Parker Stuart, at the helm. As an interdisciplinary and film artist, she has been featured in several Ae exhibitions and was awarded a Featured Artist Award at our 2017 Film Festival. Maret Polzine has also joined our team as Assistant Festival Director. They have screened work with Ae previously including at our 2018 festival where they won an Audience Award. Under our new leadership, we look forward to continuing and growing our festival to include partnerships with local artist communities and organizations to foster diverse and inclusive practices within the experimental film community. Still from 2018 Audience Award Winner, The D�rive, by Tanin Torabi Ae puts artists first. We are proud to offer affordable submission fees, waivers, and cash awards to participating filmmakers, performers, and musicians. Each year, approximately 80% of our submissions come through one of our free-to-submit programs which are offered to all Minnesota-based artists as well as any artist facing financial or political difficulties. Our waiver program has assisted filmmakers from the United States, Brazil, Vietnam, and Iran who are facing such barriers. These artists would not be able to participate in the the experimental film community without our support. Last year, we were awarded a Community Arts grant from the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council to produce a series of microcinemas which allowed us to share our artists� work with expanded audiences. These community events screened short films for new viewers including many who had never seen an experimental film program before. This grant also allowed us to pay each of our participating artists. Within the traditional system, filmmakers only get paid through winning awards. We believe that any filmmaker who is showing work should be paid for their labor and we are working to establish this standard. Still from 2018 Creative Vision Award Winner, Float, by Karli Evans We have great plans for the future of the Ae Film Festival but cannot accomplish these goals without your help. Today, we are asking you to help us fund the 2019 Film Festival. Altered Esthetics is a 501(c)3 nonprofit run by a volunteer board of directors. 100% of your tax-deductible gift to Ae goes directly to the festival�s operating costs and paying participating artists. Please consider making a donation of any amount to support the future of experimental film in the Twin Cities and beyond! Here is a breakdown of our $1110 minimum budget: $640 - Theater rental $250 - Cash stipends for the winning filmmakers $170 - Award laurels for the winning filmmakers $50 - Printing programs and promotional materials"

We made our goal! Now we are looking towards getting as close as we can to our stretch goal of $4,200. A bigger budget will allow us to: Publish on Steam! Commission higher quality illustrations! Cover our Construct3 license! Port to consoles like PS4 and Switch Thanks for your support! What is Grace? Grace is a short story-based game about two field technicians working in the Sierra Nevada of California. They're tasked with monitoring the nests of the Ruddy Quail but discover that the study design won't work because of human impacts on the ecosystem. They have to decide whether to continue collecting data or to tell the nearby townspeople about the problem. The two protagonists, Grace and Kiran We wanted to make an immersive natural environment with this game.You can use your field guide to identify the flora and fauna that you find throughout the levels. All the trees, flowers, and birds included in this game can be found in the Sierra Nevada (except for the fictional Ruddy Quail, the Ruddy Quail was kindly voiced by the Mountain Quail). Right now we are about 60% of the way done with the development of Grace. Learning how to use Construct 3 (our game development software) was a large part of the last two months. We've also created the first and largest map, animations for the birds and main characters, pixel art of the plants, and dialogue boxes. The soundscape was designed so that birds and objects become louder as you approach them. The mechanics of the field guide are completed. Grace is the first game we've worked on together. Development began in mid-April of 2019, so we'll have been working on this for two months at the time of the kickstarter launch. When the game is completed we'll release it for free on itch.io and--if we meet our stretch goal of $4,200--Steam! We want this game to be accessible to people of all financial backgrounds. The idea for the game came from a short story that Sarah wrote to explore her own feelings about science vs. outreach. We decided to turn the short story into our first game to test our skills and to see if anyone else is interested in environmental games. We have ideas for bigger games that we'd love to make in the future! Why Do We Need Money? Making art takes a lot of time and talent, so we'd like to pay professional artists to draw higher resolution illustrations of the birds and plants for the field guide. We want to pay artists $100-200 per illustration and we have 28 illustrations to commission. Sarah is a decent digital artist, so she could make some of them if necessary. That's why we've set our goal to $2,000 with a stretch goal of $4,200. Any additional money will go toward maintaining our Construct 3 license and buying food. If we do not get funded, we plan to develop the story part of the game and release it on itch.io anyway! The pictures for the birds won't be as pretty and it will probably take longer to finish. If we don't meet our goal and you'd like updates on our progress anyway, please contact us at swampastudio@gmail.com or follow Sarah on twitter. Who Are We? We're a team of two based in Worcester, MA. Jon is a videographer and music composer who works with nonprofits in the area. Sarah is an ecosystem ecologist and is entering a Master's in Geography program in September. She has been involved in projects ranging from bird breeding ecology to tree mortality. We collaborated on every part of the design of Grace. Rough Project Timeline If we meet our goal, we'll immediately start contacting artists and commissioning illustrations. We will provide updates on the timeline for these. In the meantime, we're working on the other maps as well as polishing the demo map, adding dialogue, and making story animations for the game. We hope to finish all this by August 31st, 2019.

The CoH board game is also expandable to be solo, cooperative or competitive up to 8 players. A snapshot of the vehicles coming with the $99 Core Set Applicable stretch goals include all nation specific bonus units and universal components. Includes bonus Monastery map. Not shown but 3 Mortars, 3 MG's and 3 Anti-Tank guns are also included for each faction. Not shown are the 3 Mortars, MG's and Anti-Tank guns included for each faction. *Lead designer's note: ""I know everyone wants us to change the soviet infantry model, and we probably will, but he still cracks me up every time i see it. So arrogant lol."" Yes, all of the above is included in the 4 Player Core Set! Plus all of the free bonus stretch rewards if you pledge during the campaign :) There are currently six possible Add On's: The Terrain Pack ($26) The Solo / Cooperative Expansion ($26) the Elite Commanders Collection ($46) Oberkommando West Faction Pack. ($42) Eastern Reinforcements Pack ($16) Early Bird Pathfinder Pack ($12) The STUG Assault Pack ($15) The Metal War Chest (tin container to hold everything $22) NONE OF THESE ADD-ONS ARE NECESSARY! ALL ADD-ONS CAN BE ADDED INDIVIDUALLY BY MANUALLY INCREASING YOUR PLEDGE BY THE CORRECT AMOUNT. A POST KS SURVEY WILL CONFIRM YOUR CHOICES. These have been priced as affordably as possible for the KickStarter campaign. These represent items that we would have loved to include into the Core Set but we would never have been able to keep its price below $100. These Add Ons represent extra game features and units not essential to the core experience. (The Core Set really does contain everything you need to play Company of Heroes!) You can select a reward tier bundle that includes the add-ons you want, or you can add them individually by simply adding the correct amount to your pledge. The price is the same either way, but choosing a bundle does help with tracking counts and unlocking add-on specific stretch goals. The add-ons you add manually will be confirmed shortly after the KickStarter campaign ends through a short KS survey. Later you will be able to further add expansions or these add-ons through the 3rd Party Pledge Manager that will go live approximately in October and run for 5 months until the game ships. The Solo & Cooperative pack allows you to now play the Company of Heroes Board Game solo or with a partner! Featuring a unique fog of war and AI reaction system, overcome 10 pre-set scenarios and challenges, or dive into a fully functioning free-play system like the video games' AI multiplayer! Click Here For More Rules and Game-play Examples of the Cooperative Expansion The big boys of the armored divisions! Featuring the elite specialty vehicles and commanders that we could not fit into the Core Set. Featuring 2 unique vehicles for each nation faction. Includes the King Tiger, JagdPanther, IS-3 Heavy Tank, KV-2 Assault Tank, British Comet Tank, Sexton Motorized Artillery, US Pershing Heavy Tank and the US Sherman Calliope. Along with 2 variations of each Commander to unlock new abilities and upgrades. Note: We have also unlocked the Sherman Fireflies!! The Elite Commanders Collection features all of the Commander Packs that will be sold separately at retail for $10-12 a pack. For the KickStarter, we have bundled all 16 commanders and their special doctrinal vehicles into one bundle. Note that we will be confirming these vehicle selections with you, the backers, over the course of the campaign via a series of 8 polls to give you the option to select from this current set or alternate vehicles! This collection includes 2 of each doctrinal vehicle even the giant 3.7"" King Tiger. Note that if you are ordering two core sets to play with 5-8 people, you will probably only need one Commanders Collection unless two players want to play the exact same commander but at that point you will have over 32 commanders to choose from. Two US M5 Light Tanks have been added to the Elite Commander's Collection along with a new Mobile Forces Commander! (You may know this tank as the 'Stuart' the British nickname for them.) The next stretch goal is at 2500 packs, currently 2056 (06/22/2019) and this time the community will choose what we add next. Leave a comment in the comments section or over at boardgamegeek to put in your vote. Right now the British Sherman Firefly is in the lead (hopefully with a Tulip rockets upgrade). This is a faction pack that allows you to play with a different type of German faction. This faction focuses on mobility and its light vehicles as well as the ability to create bases anywhere on the map. Note that this is not a 5th player expansion. Two PUMAS and the Breakthrough Doctrine Commander unlocked for the Oberkommando West pack! This mobile light vehicle carries a big armor-piercing punch to help dominate the early to mid game. The next Stretch goal is at 1600 OKW Packs (currently 1100) and will be a major addition by adding not only Flak Half-tracks but a whole configurable half-track system allowing you to spawn multiple types of half-tracks (like Flak, troop transport, Anti-tank etc...) (Maybe even that searchlight halftrack :) The ISU-152 is one of our favorite units out of all the Company of Heroes video games and will receive special treatment here. It is one of the only vehicles that can switch between a powerful armor piercing round and an infantry-devastating high explosive shell. With ultra long range and heavy armor, its weakness is its lack of turret and slow turning speed. Note that if your backer number is 4600 or less (i.e. backed before Saturday June 22, 2019 Noon PST) you are receiving this pack already! ALL ADD-ONS CAN BE ADDED BY JUST MANUALLY INCREASING YOUR PLEDGE BY THE CORRECT AMOUNT. A POST KS SURVEY WILL CONFIRM YOUR CHOICES! The early bird Pathfinder Pack now available as an add on for those that missed it! You can add this to your rewards by manually adjusting your pledge up $12. If your backer number is 3051 or less you are already receiving this pack. ALL ADD-ONS CAN BE ADDED BY JUST MANUALLY INCREASING YOUR PLEDGE BY THE CORRECT AMOUNT. A POST KS SURVEY WILL CONFIRM YOUR CHOICES! The Company of Heroes Board Game is an interesting hybrid of strategy, unit tactics and resource management; just like the video games. In our experience, if you like the video games and you like board games you WILL love this game. If you are unfamiliar with the video games, but like strategy board games, tactical miniatures games or war-games, you will PROBABLY like this game, it depends on whether you are looking for a relatively fast, medium complexity WW2 strategy game. I Never Played the Video Games, Will I Still Love It? For those in the second category the important distinction to consider is that this is a cross between tactical skirmish games and economy-based resource management games so it feels and plays differently than most other games out there. While the CoH board game shares some common elements with skirmish games and tabletop miniatures games, (players are maneuvering units around on a map after all), it has such a large focus on securing, collecting and spending resources that the end experience is quite different! Playtesters that never played the video games, said they enjoyed the fun choices and purchases you get to constantly be making in addition to all the tactical maneuvering like occupying buildings, positioning mortars, or flanking to vehicle weak spots; but without getting bogged down by a lot of calculation, dice rolling or waiting between turns. A third of the game revolves around your HQ board and production tiles. This is where you spend resources to unlock buildings, purchase new units and upgrades, as well build up experience and Commander levels. How Does It Stack Up? If you are a fan of of some of our favorite WW2 board games you will probably enjoy the Company of Heroes board game as well. But you should know that it is simpler (and less time consuming) than Squad Leader, Tide of Iron and Bolt Action. It has more tactical depth than titles like Memoir 44'. The unit interactions and abilities approach the degree found in games like Heroes of Normandie and Conflict of Heroes but has a more streamlined (and therefore lighter) combat system. This chart is a very rough comparison, it does not take into account play time. Also, even though complexity is not always the same as tactical depth; this chart combines the two together weighting tactical depth a little higher (otherwise Axis and Allies would be farther to the right.) The CoH board game ranges from 60-90 minutes in standard mode. It contains squad level tactics but also emphasizes capturing resources and many purchase decisions. *Beta Prototype Components Shown in Videos Gameplay Video - Real Time The 2 player live game continues as we extend the victory conditions from a medium game (15 points) to a long game (21) and we switch to Real Time Mode. These victory point levels are similar to playing a 250, 500 or 1000 point match in the video games. (Note that the first round is not an accurate representation in this video because we were using a 2 minute instead of a 3 minute sand timer at first, but later we correct.) *A few changes and improvements to the rules and gameplay have been incorporated since these tutorials. For example, spawn points are the entire back row of that side of the board, allowing faster horizontal movement and a wider range of openers. Click the image above to read or download the draft rulebook from ISSUU.com (Note that this is only an unfinished draft and represents a work in progress.) ALL OF THESE LANGUAGES HAVE UNLOCKED A *FULL LANGUAGE VERSION OF THE CORE SET and the COOPERATIVE EXPANSION! The ECC and OKW Commander Cards will be printed in the back of a language's rulebook for reference. Each version will require a small logistical fee that will be charged during the Pledge Manager (less than $10). These contents may be increased from stretch goals! They are also subject to change and approval by SEGA. These models are also shown with the decals we hope to unlock mid campaign. Note the AT guns, mortars and MG models are still draft versions and will be improved. 1:120 Scale, Solid, Pre-Assembled Models. The vehicle models are in 1:120 (15mm scale) with some greater than 3 inches in length. Pre-assembled with rotating turrets and produced in a base color for each nation. Note that most, but not all model designs have been completed; we will continue to add detail and complexity throughout the line. Infantry and weapon teams shown here represent draft versions. Note that we plan to fudge the scale of the infantry miniatures by approximately 1-2 mm in order to help with detail as well as handling that small size. Heavy Weight ABS Plastic. We will be using a heavier weight plastic than our last game to increase the heft of each miniature. They will be entirely solid as well! (No hollowing.) They will be manufactured with high precision-cut steel molds. US and German scout and light vehicles. Scout vehicles are ones that can capture points, reinforce troops or both. Light vehicles like these M8 Greyhounds and 222 Armored Cars are more offensive. Why 1:120 / 15mm Scale? We did not choose this scale, the scale chose us! There were a lot of considerations and design dependencies that were formed as we wrestled the board game version of Company of Heroes into existence. We wanted it to be accessible to a wide range of players, so the board had to be large but reasonable and able to be placed on a good sized kitchen table or convention table. We needed X amount of hexes in order to create enough space and distance on the maps, and those hexes needed to be of a fairly large size in order to accommodate everything we would be putting into them. The buildings and map features had to be close to the scale of vehicles and infantry and the end result was 1:120 scale. If any changes are made to the scale going forward it will be to increase the size to 1:100 (good news for all the FoW fans out there) but for now plan and back assuming 1:120. What is particularly cool about this scale are the simple conversions: a 23 foot Panzer IV becomes a 2.3 inch model. A 17' Staghound becomes a 1.7"" miniature. Simple! Just a reminder that the components shown represent a work in progress and are subject to change. Stay tuned for the updated Churchills! We are deeply indebted to both SEGA and Relic Entertainment for giving us the opportunity to develop the board game version of their wonderful franchise. As devout fans of Company of Heroes, this project is a dream come true for us. This board game only turned out as good as it did because of the years of design and crafting that went into the video games.

Joy. Ambition. Regret. In a time where family was one�s true north, with the Great Depression looming, a wave of discontent rushed over the city. Ambition can lead to desperation; regret can lead to death. A young girl is ready to leave home for the big city, despite strangling words of caution from a family that can�t, or won�t understand her. With a chance to find a brighter path�she finds him instead � the origin of a heartbreaking legacy that will stain the city of Cleveland for years to come. Why Immersive? Audiences today are choosing personal experiences over the purchase of physical objects. Immersive theatre dives into this mindset - a guest can attend multiple performances and have a completely different experience based on the choices they make throughout the evening. Combining elements from theatre, night clubs, and personal exploration into one evening of fully engaging entertainment, audiences will want to gather afterwards to share their experience and make plans for their next trip. Background Information Shadow of the Run was conceived in December 2015 by Beth McGee and Adam Kern. In January 2016 the project was awarded a $1,000 grant as an audience favorite from Notre Dame College�s SEAChange Program, prior to appearing in the Cleveland Leadership Center�s Accelerate Competition in February of the same year. With the addition of co-creators and partners Ben Needham and Christine Woods, the team began to develop a full scale immersive. With initial support from Joe and Anthony Russo, the team continued development to find the right opportunity to bring Immersive to the city of Cleveland. As implied in the title Chapter 1: WanderLust is the first part of a larger production, aimed for a 2020 opening."

You may have previously encountered my work in the Magical Art Therapy series, which is an ongoing collection of sigils--or magical images--that use a symbolic visual language inspired by nature, mythology, and occult practices like alchemy and the tarot to address topics related to mental illness, trauma, and surviving in an unkind world. The Magical Art Therapy series has been inspired by my personal experiences as a mentally ill survivor of traumatic events, and I have been beyond humbled at the response from other people that have faced similar difficulties in their lives and found comfort and understanding in my work. Last year, I ran my first Kickstarter campaign which, with the help of my wonderful backers, brought two of the sigils--Sigil for Swift Justice Against Those That Got Away With It and Sigil for Stealing Back What You Can--to life as enamel pins. For this project, our goal is to bring the rest of the Sigils for Trauma and Recovery set into print as enamel pins, including the final stretch goals of reprinting the two designs from the original project for those that missed out the first time. Magical Art Therapy: Sigils for Trauma and Recovery. If we meet all our stretch goals for this campaign, all of the above designs will be made into enamel pins. *INTIAL GOAL: **!UNLOCKED!** AT $544* Sigil for the Retroactive Protection of Your Younger Self shows a ferocious dragon protecting a cracked egg, surrounded by weapons it has broken. Sometimes survivors of traumatic experiences wish someone or something had been able to protect them when they were vulnerable. This sigil represents a fantasy of being able to go back in time and defend yourself from harm, with the dragon being an invulnerable guardian that can stand up to any threat. *FIRST STRETCH GOAL: **!UNLOCKED!** AT $972* Sigil for Safety Against Your Nightmares shows a unicorn illuminating the dark, driving away barely-seen horrors. Some of us who have experienced trauma struggle with lingering fears related to the traumatic event, including that it will reoccur. Besides trauma, many other things, including certain mental illness symptoms, can cause upsetting thoughts and fears we struggle to cope with. This sigil represents the desire to stand against and banish these type of nightmares. *SECOND STRETCH GOAL: **!UNLOCKED!** AT $1,350* Sigil for Mourning Your Lost Futures shows a coyote wearing a crown of crystals crying over a coyote skull wearing a crown of wilted flowers, while the moon passes overhead. This sigil represents an understanding place to grieve the lives you could have lived and things that could have been if you had not been adversely impacted by trauma and mental illness. *THIRD STRETCH GOAL: **!UNLOCKED!** AT $1,720* Sigil for Accepting Dormancy shows a hedgehog holding an acorn hibernating in the roots of an oak tree while life goes on on the surface above. Many if us that have ""lost time"" to mental and physical illnesses struggle with the feeling that we are behind and have missed out. This sigil represents accepting these fallow periods have happened and are not a complete loss, symbolized by the acorn's promise of new growth. *FOURTH STRETCH GOAL: REPRINT **!UNLOCKED!** AT $2,100* Sigil for Stealing Back What You Can shows a magpie plucking jewels from a dangerous tangle of thorns. It represents recovering after periods of personal instability and difficulty to return to the world. Many of us that have been greatly affected by traumatic experiences or have ""lost time"" to mental or physical illnesses feel like success is more difficult to achieve for us, especially as traditionally defined. This sigil and its clever magpie project hope and encouragement that you will find a way to achieve what you want, even if the path may be hard or not what you originally envisioned. This is a reprint of a design from the first Kickstarter. *FIFTH AND FINAL STRETCH GOAL: REPRINT UNLOCKS AT $2,400* Sigil for Swift Justice Against Those That Got Away With It shows two wolves flanking the �gishj�lmur or Helm of Awe, an Icelandic magical stave that invokes terror in one's enemies. Freed from the chains that held them, the wolves represent a curse on the people that have hurt you but were shielded from the true consequences of their actions by society, and a wish for them one day to finally face the cosmic justice they deserve. This is a reprint of a design from the first Kickstarter. All unlocked pin designs will be: hard enamel black nickel plated 1.75 inches tall backed with two posts and black rubber backers pinned to custom backing cards with a description of the sigil on the back side packaged in biodegradable clear bags mailed in recycled bubble mailers that can be reused or recycled at services that take plastic grocery bags (note: some orders may be mailed in my older, non-recyclable packaging stock--no solution is perfect, but I am trying to move towards using more eco-friendly packaging material) Below are images of the enamel pins and backing cards from the last Kickstarter, which were made to the same specifications as above, so you can have a clear idea what to expect from the finished product. note that these particular designs are not available as rewards for this Kickstarter unless we reach the stretch goals to reprint them See more information about the Custom Art tier by visiting this update. An add-on is an additional item that you can add to your pledge at any reward tier by pledging more. I wanted to make some of the other Magical Art Therapy products I sell online and at cons available to backers this way! These items will ship in the same package as your pins.

I'm Ronald the artist who goes by @seerlight! I draw digital doodles and design pins based off those doodles. You can visit my online store seerlightart.com to see my previous pin designs. Although I've only created one kickstarter before, I've figured out how kickstarter works now. For this campaign I'll be recreating some of my most popular doodles into enamel pin sets! Why Pledge? Kickstarter will be the cheapest place to buy these pins at. Plus you will have the chance to grab some exclusive pins once we meet any stretch goals that will only be available through other special means(patreon?) after this campaign. This campaign will run until June 30th! The Pin Designs Update on Plant Sodas Due to the stems in the original designs being too thin, I had to add some additional leaf elements. I think this actually improves the design in the end! Also a small new change; the blue plant soda's size has changed from 1.5"" to 1.6"" to have the soda can closer to the other 2 soda cans' size. Stretch Goals There will indeed be stretch goals throughout this campaign! Once we reach a goal there will be a new pin design available for ordering once the campaign is finished. These will be exclusive designs that will not be sold in my store afterwords. They will only be available through special means. Stretch goal 1: $1000 City Boba Unlocked! Stretch Goal 2: $1500 Mahou Scissors Unlocked! Stretch Goal 3: $2000 Mahou Syringe Unlocked!

Please fill them out as soon as you can then. Mid July: Pins will be in production and will hopefully be done by the end of July or start of August at the latest.

I�m a composer and for the past two years I�ve been writing A Passion for the Planet, an hour-long work for chorus and orchestra that focuses on the pains and perils of climate change. Two years ago, I was reading an essay in which climate scientists were lamenting their difficulties in capturing the public�s attention. One of them was quoted as saying, �People won�t really respond to the climate crisis until they connect with it on an emotional level.� Geoffrey Hudson, composer of A Passion for the Planet And that made a lightbulb go on in my head. Music is a powerful way to form emotional connections. Perhaps we can harness that power to confront climate change. A Passion for the Planet starts in a place of beauty. The opening movement is a beautiful, spacious celebration of the wonders of creation. It moves from reverence, to gratitude, to revelry, before closing with some resonant �alleluias�. After that, things get darker, as the music looks at what is already happening all around us. That journey into darkness reaches a climax with a musical depiction of the infamous �hockey stick� graphs. Temperatures rise; oceans rise; extinction rates increase� The world flies out of control. What have you done with what was given you? And then a children�s choir stands up and sings words by the Irish poet Theo Dorgan, �What have you done with what was given you? What have you done with the blue, beautiful world?� It�s like an arrow into the listeners� hearts. And that�s a turning point in this piece. I don�t want to leave listeners in that dark place. Over the last two years, when I tell people what I�m working on, a bunch of people have said, �Oh, you�re writing a requiem for the planet.� And I say, �No. It�s not time for that yet. We don�t have much time left � the IPCC report gave us twelve years � but it�s not over yet. We all need to roll up our sleeves and get serious about turning this around.� And A Passion for the Planet is about breaking through the defenses and avoidance mechanisms that people have built up around this horrific threat. conductor Tony Thornton The last three movements of the Passion revolve around hope, beginning with a wonderful thought from David Orr: �Hope is a verb with its sleeves rolled up.� The piece ends with everyone singing; performers and audience members join together to sing a chorale tune. We�re all in this together. It�s bigger any of us as individuals. The only way to succeed is for all of us to roll up our sleeves. baritone Dashon Burton I�m very fortunate in having some wonderful collaborators for the premiere. In June, Tony Thornton will be leading the Illuminati Vocal Arts Ensemble in the first performance of A Passion for the Planet. I�ve been at the early rehearsals; the beauty of their sound just slays me. We have two fabulous soloists, baritone Dashon Burton and soprano Alisa Pearson, and we�ll be joined by a chamber orchestra of 12 players. I�m so excited to hear the first performance. And if you�re in driving distance of western Massachusetts on June 15th, I urge you to join us. soprano Alisa Pearson The reason I�m here on Kickstarter today is to ask for your help in making a recording of this piece. Our goal is to get this music out into the world � to have groups across the US and internationally perform it. Having a good recording will be tremendously helpful in that process � allowing conductors to easily gauge what it is they�re signing up for. Please be generous. Budget Everything we raise towards our goal of $7,650 will go to fund the recording of A Passion for the Planet. The money will go to Hybrid Vigor Music, the Massachusetts-based not-for-profit that has championed A Passion for the Planet, which will use the money to pay the musicians, recording engineers, and Kickstarter. Anything raised beyond our goal will support our campaign to encourage other groups across the United States and internationally to perform A Passion for the Planet. Here�s what that budget looks like. The Timeline We have a recording date scheduled in June 2019. Post-production work will take place over the summer. We should have a finished recording by August 2019."

Since we first started making leather goods, we have been fine tuning every aspect of the production process. From the design of the bag, to the leather and hardware types, we have been working to keep them as authentic as possible, while maintaining the highest level of functionality and performance. As this is our second duffel bag we have launched on Kickstarter, we have had a lot of feedback on features people are looking for in a travel bag, not the least of which was having a size option that was big enough to be used as a carry on for a cross-continental flight, while staying within the carry on size restrictions. We built this bag around the idea of maximizing the usability of a carry on duffel, and making it easy to transport with your luggage, through security and around the airport. Removable Luggage Strap Keeps Duffel Secured to Luggage Handle The idea for this specific type of bag has come after getting frustrated with trying to get through security with my duffel bag and laptop, having to gate check my carry on luggage, and wishing my smaller travel bags were big enough to carry all of my important items that I didn't want going in with my checked bag. These problems, along with a ton of feedback from customers, family and friends, we have come up with a bag that not only makes airline travel easier, but it stays right in line with our Classic + Rugged Kodiak Leather look and feel. Introducing the 45L Denali Leather Duffel. A travel bag that can be used for business, as well as the outdoors. A bag that makes you want to plan that bucket list trip, just so you can take it with you. Core Features: - 45L size (which is within the carry on size requirements for airlines.) 45 Liter Carrying Capacity - Separated, padded laptop compartment on the lower portion of the bag near the base. This makes going through security so much easier!! Just unzip the base compartment and pull out your laptop for security, then place it back in the separated compartment. This pocket is big enough for a 15"" laptop as well as a power bank. Padded Laptop Pocket - Fits a 15"" laptop or smaller as well as a portable powerbank. - Zippered pocket allows easy access and security for your laptop or tablet. Easily fits a 15"" laptop or smaller. - Removable Luggage Strap for easy carry on top of roller suitcase. This will keep your bag secure and keep it from falling off or sliding around on top of your suitcase / luggage. Removable Luggage Strap - Shoe pocket. This pocket is similar to our 60L duffel style, and can be used to separate your dirty clothes, shoes, or give easy access to any other items. Convenient and secure exterior shoe pocket - - 3 exterior zippered pockets. One on each side of the bag near the handles, and one large zippered pocket on the end of the bag. This pocket is perfect for your passport, keys, or wallet. - Large Zippered Compartment - Thick, Top Grain Leather. - YKK Zippers. - Heavy Duty Nylon Liner. - Brass feet. 5 Brass Feet - Removable & Adjustable shoulder strap. - Double layered carrying handle on the front of the bag. YKK Zippers + Double Wrapped Handle Interior || Zippered compartment, phone and pen holders, heavy duty nylon liner, 45L carrying capacity Exterior || Shoe Pocket, adjustable shoulder strap, 2 zippered side pockets, 1 large zippered pocket for phone, keys wallet. Double zipper can be locked. Separate padded laptop compartment on base, making it easy to get through security. Big enough for a powerbank and laptop. Sturdy carry handle. Background We are Kodiak Leather (www.kodiakleather.com), a startup in Lehi, Utah founded by Jared Morse, an outdoorsman who was frustrated by the lack of reasonably priced leather bags that would hold up through all the wear and tear of daily use. This inspired Jared to create Kodiak Leather Co. and our custom leather bags. After finding only the highest quality leather and hardware, we set out to build a bag that would last a lifetime. Fast Forward 4 Years... After having 4 successful Kickstarter campaigns, the Buffalo Leather Satchel, The Classic Weekender Duffel, the Sitka Leather Messenger, and our most recent Kobuk Leather Backpack, we have come full circle on offering a wide variety of travel bags , briefcases (similar to the satchel and the messenger), as well as some smaller, everyday carry items like journals and wallets. We have had countless insights on product design, future product offerings, and functionality suggestions from our 3200+ previous backers.

I even thought I would go into paleontology, but life has a way of taking you in the direction you will fit most, and for me that was art! This is my second Kickstarter, and after having a great success with my furry forest friends pin set, I am going forward with my dinosaur friends. I have nine total designs done, and 3 different variants picked out for each. I will post all details of each design as it is unlocked. The factory I usually use has already provided me with quotes and is ready to produce these wonderful scaly friends! The first set of all pins will be done in bronze or rose gold, and with each variant a different metal finish.

How did you determine the cost to produce these pins? I work closely with a factory, the same factory I used to make previously produced pins on my first kickstarter. While the price per pin varies, I took an average cost of mold and per pin cost. Some more detailed designs cost a little bit more to produce so I factored that in while determining stretch goals. If your initial goal is not met will you still produce the pins? I absolutely hope to produce all pins below at some point, but likely without backing this may not be for some time. What pins have you produced in the past? The below pins were produced during my previous kickstarter and are available in my etsy store!"

In just a few clicks, a group of people can share memories, well wishes and pictures. Then Kindra weaves it all together into a legacy book. It's the most meaningful, personalized gift perfect for any special occasion. Birthdays | Weddings | Anniversaries | Graduations | Retirements | Bar & Bat Mitzvahs | Baby Showers | Bridal Showers | Farewells | Mother's Day | Father's Day | Teacher Appreciation | Employee Appreciation | ""The quality of your relationships determines the quality of your life."" Make sure the special people in your life know their ripple effect in the world with a Kindra book (and get up to $70 off!) Be remembered as a gifting legend! We do the hard part, you get the glory. Help Kindra complete the automation of our design platform. After making so many test books manually, we want our weekends back. ;) Infuse planet earth with love, LoVe, LOVE! We took a collective scrapbooking project that used to take tedious months of content collection, design and printing and condensed it into a few clicks. Select questions for people to answer (or create your own questions). Kindra collects stories, memories and photos from collaborators through Instagram, Facebook or their phone or computer. The questions become the chapters of the book. We design and print the book for you (after your review and approval, of course). Your lucky recipient tells you they have ""never felt as loved or as special before."" Pure magic. Here's what makes Kindra different than a standard photo book: 1) Kindra is especially designed to honor someone using our unique and signature layouts. The first page of every book is this word cloud composed of the words collected to describe the recipient(s). 2) We don't just collect photos; we also gather stories, sentiments and well wishes. That's why someone said �Kindra is like the storybook of my life written by everyone who loves me."" 3) It's not just one person making a book, it's a group of people creating a book. In fact, it�s never been easier to co-author a book before. People from around the world can celebrate milestones from afar. Fair warning: Side effects include immeasurable joy. We're not sure who love us more - gift organizers or the recipients! We have a 97% satisfaction rate from on the first round of test books.

I�m Danielle DiMare, the creator of Kindra. For more than 10 years, I've been making these keepsake books for my family because I believe everyone deserves to know how special they are to the world. About 2 years ago, I was inspired to figure out how to digitize this gift-making engine and make it available to world. Prior to pursuing this dream, I spent 15 years helping NYC create citywide arts, technology and enrichment programs for young people. I know a thing or two about bringing big ideas to life. Driven by my lifelong passion for community and creativity, I decided to focus all my energy into creating Kindra - a powerful vehicle for collective kindness.

Here are some sample pages from each story: THE TELL-TALE HEART (in which a guy doesn't like the look of another guy's eye... and bad things happen) THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (in which a guy visits a pair of sick siblings in their rundown house... and bad things happen) THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO (in which one dude is annoyed by another dude, so he offers him some fancy wine... and bad things happen) THE PIT & THE PENDULUM (in which a guy is imprisoned and tortured and ultimately... bad things don't really happen?) AND MUCH MORE! These are just a few sample pages from each story! The book measures 6"" x 6"" and features 80 pages of fully illustrated silliness (and of course a few puzzles & games to boot)! It's Poe-tastic! :) So, what's the deal with these ""CLASSICS (kind of)"" books anyways? Okay, here goes: Remember all those crusty, old books you had to read for English class? Or maybe you're currently reading those crusty, old books for some crusty, old teacher in your crusty, old English class? Don't wanna read them? Problem solved! Read ""CLASSICS (kind of)"" instead! Disclaimer: I can't guarantee these will help you pass that crusty, old English class with that crusty, old teacher (Note: I'm a teacher myself, so I'm pretty sure it's okay for me to poke fun at teachers). While remaining faithful (kind of) to the original stories, I have condensed these classics into short, comedic adaptations complete with silly illustrations as well as puzzles & games and extra goodies. These will be a great introduction for new readers of most ages, but also an entertaining time for folks who love the original crusty, old books! I actually do enjoy those crusty, old books. But I really enjoy poking fun at them as well! So far, I've created 7 of these ""CLASSICS (kind of)"" ... and with your help, I'll create even more! The possibilities are endless!!! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT! All backers of $10 or more will also now receive a ""BEE'S MEOW"" postcard print from my upcoming line of silly prints! :) At this point, I am only able to ship within the United States. If you live outside the U.S. and would like to pledge, send me a message, and we can try to figure something out. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT!!!"

A lot of movement options, both classic and new. Dashing, dash jumping, wall jumping, dash wall jumping. Along with a grappling hook, free climbing fences, grabbing ceilings, dive kicking, rail grinding, and more! Special abilities that are either tied to button combinations or have their own dedicated buttons. A combo meter to shoot big lasers, dash through enemies, and overall look very cool with. Shop for upgrades and find armor that displays visually, including heroic scarves and very red neckties. Cool weapons like baseball bats and halberds. Lots of powerups and exploring! A colorful cast of very normal well-adjusted everyday CEO's to argue with. GIGABUSTER will be launching on Steam with Windows, Mac, and Linux versions. We're also planning on being available on Xbox One, but more on that as development progresses! Because the game is made with Construct 2, it can't be exported to the Switch. But, if the stretch goal is met we will be able to get a port done. If not it will depend on the success of the PC version. A Switch port will be possible if we can meet a $50,000 goal. And you can wishlist us on Steam by clicking below! GIGABUSTER will get you in and out of the action as fast as possible. All dialogue and cinematics are skippable, including the intro stage for repeat playthroughs. You start the game with an array of abilities, including airdashing, double jumping, auto-charging, etc. The movement will let you toss yourself around levels as fast as you like. Upgrades will only expand your basic abilities further. If you'd like to give it a spin, you can try out a demo version of the game at: https://gamejolt.com/games/GIGABUSTER/340754 After the sudden disappearance of the CZEVY corporation's CEO, the position fell to his son, Lou. A change in direction followed. The company invested heavily in GI, an advanced form of artificial intelligence, acquiring the NUN research company and beginning work on the ""Happiness"" project. The process was wrought with problems. Delays, bugs, erratic behavior. These problems were ultimately solved when Lou proposed using another human as a canvas for the GI's personality. Happiness became a pet project of Lou's. A year later, Happiness became a powerful tool for CZEVY. So powerful, in fact, that outside investment began pouring in. And just as NUN was poached by CZEVY, CZEVY became the target of much larger, more powerful companies. Lou lost control over it. This resulted in several mergers, narrowing down to three other global corporations. The resulting 4-way merger completed, and the GEC was born. Lou lost influence, becoming one of four heads in the new company. As time passed, the GEC's true motivations crept to the surface. While GI was a powerful tool for running companies, it would be even more powerful for running governments. Despite Lou's protests, calling GI too unstable to be involved in governance, The GEC's outreach earned it a meeting with Mayor Fuon to sell him on GI's usage in the future of his city. But someone within the company has other plans. Lou, still the public face of the GEC, stands at the mayor's office with his life's work, Happiness, waiting to begin their highly televised meeting. Unfortunately, there's been a slight delay, as he convinced an unexpected guest to join. Someone very important. ""It'll be easy. All you have to do is aim and pull the trigger"" We are aiming for a Summer or Fall 2019 for release. Roughly the second half of the year. Waller. I'm an artist who makes games. I live in the US on the east coast, and have been drawing most of my life. I've worked on a couple other small indie games, and helped out with others. Jasmine is the composer. She fills games with music. Lots of games. Lots and lots of games. I'm a big fan of the speed and ease of access in the Megaman X titles, the combat of the Zero games, and the quick and digestible structure of both. I always found myself wishing there was a happy medium between the two, and wanted to create my own game that merges my favorite aspects together, to make a game that scratches my own itch. Hopefully this game serves as a window into my own likes, and possibly even yours! Graffiti The Harbor stage will be filled with green graffiti, styled after its boss' SHARK gang. At this tier, you'll get to add your own to the stage, which will include either a word or short phrase, coupled with some type of small drawing. It may also include some scrawl to obscure it enough to fit in with the stage's aesthetic. Employee of the Month You did it! Wow! Very nice. You are now a face on a plaque which is selected at random from a hat every time someone enters a shop. You can either send me a photo of your face, or you can describe what you'd like to look like. I'll use technology to transfer your flesh into the game so you can be a plaque. Your face will appear at random. Someone else's might be put up too. It's random. Sometimes the plaque might not even be on the wall. Maybe it'll be on the pile of junk in the back. It's an honor. NPC Throughout the game, you'll find NPC characters walking around in both the hub world and stages. These characters are all optional, meaning you can play the entire game without interacting with them. At this tier, you'll get to design one. However, these will have to fit with the theme of one of the game's factions. Luckily, the game has a large cast of character types, and isn't limited to just robots, so this should be a fun category. There are possible additions to how NPC's appear, such as being added to the hub world randomly as you complete their respective stage types (completing the asteroid stage adding astronauts as possible NPC types in the hub world, for example). These particular NPC's may not be talked to. There will be multiple areas of the game where NPC's will congregate, but for now this includes the City (opening stage), Harbor (SHARK stage), Oil Rig (demo stage), and hub world. There will likely be additions to the NPC locales as we get further in development. The playable demo also includes some NPC's in both the hub world and oil rig as small examples. These NPC's are mostly to make the stages and regions feel lived in, as part of their respective corporations and companies. Scarf While this will not be part of the main armor upgrade path, this reward will be a special scarf hidden away in one of the game's stages. As always, I'll vet these to make sure they're minimally within the realm of possibility of the game, but I'll be interested in your ideas and we'll see what we can work out! Try to think of something cool. And finally, rewards will definitely be vetted. I'll reserve the right to turn down certain rewards if they're deemed too offensive or in poor taste. (Example of a chain-themed scarf) The base amount for the campaign goes mostly towards music and sound effects. While the base goal won't fund 100% of the music cost, I'll be funding the difference myself. Anything above that will go towards potential porting costs. I also want to add that the base amount is not representative of the total amount required to make a game like this - I'm relying on savings to make up the difference in budget. Any amount over the base goal should make things easier. Here's a preview of some of GIGABUSTER's music, composed by Jasmine Cooper (http://perennialsounds.com/)! thanks dude PRESS KIT !"

A true story. Like many new moms, exhausted late up at night with a boy who doesn't want to sleep, I was reading a book after book about baby's sleep. So much advice, but none of it truly worked. We tried to develop a bed time routine to help my son sleep better. But I struggled to convince him to cooperate. ""It's Bedtime! A true story"" is a humorous presentation of the duality of the experience of being a mother. In two separate stories, the book portrays the last hour before a child goes to sleep, the routine of finishing play, brushing teeth, taking a bath and dressing for sleep. In the first version of the story, the child is happily teaming up with mom, willingly brushing teeth, taking a bath and marching to bed. In the alternative story, the child is resisting mom on the way upstairs, splashing mom with water and disobeying her at every step. Exhausted mom collapses and is carried to bed by her husband. Both stories culminate in the middle. The child wakes up and the rest of the family. It is a reminder that regardless of how each day goes, you can�t predict how the night will unfold. The life of a mom is a true roller-coaster. I became interested in telling these stories after I noticed that this is something we mothers repeatedly share with one another. Every day we tell other mothers of our struggles in putting our toddlers to sleep looking for sympathy and understanding. However, bedtime experience is also a broader metaphor for the ups and downs we experience every day raising our little ones. Only when the children are happy and co-operative, our days are easy and we have the energy to enjoy our lives. This story is also a lesson for our children. It appeals to kids through humor and the use of themes popular with toddlers such as funny pets and zoo animals, train, etc. In addition to being fun, the book is helping children develop empathy for their parents. It teaches children to listen and help during the bedtime routine but also beyond. II started working on the book three years ago and is finally ready to be put in the hands of children and their parents. ""It's Bedtime ! A true story"" will be a beautiful 7x7 inches inches in size, 36-page long Board Book with thick pages intended for children. REWARDS BECOME PART OF THE BOOK I wanted to create some special rewards to show you all how much your support and help means to me. Some of you will end up in the book! Here is how it works: - Supporters who select ""Your family stars in the book + Board Book copy"" package will have their families drawn walking on the street in places marked with numbers 1 - 2 - 3 - 4. We will reach out to each backer to confirm their location. The choice will be allocated on the first-come-first-served basis, meaning the first backer will be able to choose any location, the second backer will be able to choose from the three remaining locations and so on. - Supporters who select ""Your family in the story! - TWO pages - "" package will have their families feature as door-to-door neighbors drawn either in the windows of the house or enjoying the roof terrace, places marked 5 - 6. They will feature on both pages of the book. The choice will be allocated on the first-come-first-served basis, meaning the first backer will be able to choose location 5 or 6. The second backer's family will be drawn in the remaining location. - The supporter who selects the ""Name the street an add your family"" package will choose the name for the street on which the story happens (must be children friendly) and will have their family featured in location 7, on the balcony of the house. Pages that could feature your family. TELL YOUR OWN STORY with a custom illustration. Whether is a gift for yourself or for a loved one, nothing is more unique than a custom work of art that tells your own story. I am passionate about creating emotions and my art is all about love, feelings and memories. My illustrations will bring you back to your favorite memory every time you look at it. If you are not familiar with my work you can click on the link below to check out more of my work and style. With my illustration you will be able to tell your own story . https://www.instagram.com/lauraoceanbeach/ ... NOW I JUST NEED YOUR HELP :) As with all the creative endeavors, there are costs to publishing and selling your own work, and looking at the cold numbers, I won't be able to do it alone. With your help I am confident, that this book will finally be able to set sail, and all the work I've put into this project over the last three years will result in something beautiful.

OMG! Photo Mode - Currently, you can press tab, and it dumps the last 10 seconds to a polaroid mp4 on your hard-drive. That's how I made all the polaroid-framed GIFs you've seen, and even the alpha playtest can do it (try it!). Cool, neat for capturing the moment, but basic. So what if birb could, say, place a camera? Scrub back time, and change what cameras are used when? Add a color filter? Put a goofy sticker on top? Or even just take a goofy selfie? That's photo mode, and it's our final stretch goal. This will (most likely) not be in the game before we ship, because it's a lot of work to do right. This amounts to us locking in the subject of our first major post-launch patch, and - that's why our stretch goals don't go any higher. They've been a blast, but, don't wanna over-promise, ya know? So let's have fun with this last one, and knock this Kickstarter out of the park! Grind on bendy straws, kick-flip over staplers, and carve killer lines through cardboard and sticky tape parks! Explore a bunch of bird-sized parks, with simple controls familiar to any tiny hawk. Find fancy clothing, secret mixtapes of new music, birbs that need your help, and more! Skate to an original low-fi birb-hop soundtrack - or drop in your own mp3s! And if you bail, you just get back up - because above all else, skate birbs try their best! SkateBIRD will release on PC, Mac and Linux. Also maybe other places. We talkin to peeps. We'll also offer DRM-free via itch.io, but wishlists super appreciated even if you'd use itch. As for the physical rewards, we don't do merch often. These are once-in-a-lifetime. Want a SkateBIRD fingerboard, or a skate park playset? A life-sized SkateBIRD board? Snag it now! Our studio's been making games for 7 years. SkateBIRD is our fourth, and hopefully second Kickstarted game. You all helped launch our studio. Now let's make another game together! You're a lonely lil' bird, and your Big Friend has hung up their board for good. Their job sucks, and lately, they're barely ever home to play with you. You're gonna fix all that with the power of being a chill little skateboarding bird. You may be tiny, but the more you skate, the more following you get, the more the world of bird skating will open up. Birds will come check out your park, and maybe even host events! Above all else, skate birds try their best. Skate parks in SkateBIRD are, first and foremost: parks. Explorable, fun sandboxes to just chill and skate around in. You'll find bowls to skate (sometimes with cereal in them!), hidden routes, and maybe even zoom through some doors birbs aren't supposed to open. As you explore, you'll find secret hats, clothing and more for your birb to try on, and different skateboards too (some with weird powers). You'll even find secret mixtapes, which unlock more in-game tunes to skate to. If you're more into progression, just talk to one of the other birbs in the park. Pretty much everyone you meet has something that needs doing, whether it be retrieving a toy, finding them a snack, or even knocking over a book so they can explore the nearby desk. As you complete tasks, you get more known as a skate birb. More birbs will come hang out, more tasks will be offered, and eventually you'll host a skate event with all your new friends. Finish that, win or lose, and the birbs help you get to a totally new skate park. Maybe you'll break into an office and play with desk toys, or go explore another Big Friend's fancy house! As you unlock more skate parks, you'll have more places to play, more clothing and boards and mixtapes to go find, more tasks to try, and! Your ""Big Friend"" (your human) comes along for the ride. If you're in an office, it's because you're getting them a better job. If you're in a bedroom and there's floor undies you don't recognize... maybe you have a new big friend! SkateBIRD spins a tale of how a little birb can make a big difference, but the story doesn't get in the way. It's there if you want to look closer, but if you just treat things as a series of fun skate parks with no further context required, the game is totally on board with that too. We knew music choice would be key, so our composer Nathan Madsen went into a cool, bird-filled cave, and came out bearing this. Think of it as low-fi birb-hop to skateboard to. Rather than trying for pop-punk/skate-punk (but not having That One Song everyone expects), we wanted something fresh, built for birbs trying their best. But maybe it's not your thing? SkateBIRD will support dropping mp3s into a folder, and mixing that into the soundtrack. Because that's what the in-game music is: a mixtape (on a virtual cassette - we'll even do the clicky flip-around noises). You flag which tracks you want in a tape, make as many as you want, and swap between tapes as you like. You can use it to just tune the overall music to your liking, or make a bunch of tapes that suit specific moods. Don't got mp3s, but want options beyond just low-fi birb-hop? Every level has at least one secret mixtape, and finding it unlocks tracks that we think are cool, but that are significant departures from the main OST. Go find those, and you've got even more mixtape options! Until you start a challenge, SkateBIRD is just a chill skateboarding sandbox, so you can tune the difficulty to your liking. If a particular challenge is too hard? Ignore it, you don't gotta do everything to progress. Want more difficulty? Pick the hard ones, go full out! It also controls great with keyboard & mouse (really! that's how I test half the time) The challenges range from high scores, to collecting items within a certain time limit, to weirder stuff like knocking over books or finding hidden stuff. We want to provide a broad range, so you can pick and mix your favorites... or go for 100%, if that's more your thing! There's also a wide range of gameplay options, ranging from simple control-rebinding stuff to tweaking how hard it is to balance in a manual or grind. There's even a gameplay speed slider, if you'd rather make things a bit more chill (it's also great for slow-mo trick videos). We intend to ship the physical rewards ahead of the game where we can. The Bird Sized Box tiers need to wait until the game is done, but everything else can be finished earlier. The pin is also included in the $150 Deluxe Bird Sized Box, and all the $400+ Tiers. Pinion tier gets you 1 inch enamel pin of a cute little skatebirb being awesome! This is being produced by @emiface, who has made a bunch of other awesome pins. That blue ""Nice"" and hat is sparkly enamel and it looks so fancy you could just die. Tiny Skatepark Playset gets you a birb, a board, and some little ramps and such (not pictured) to play around with! These are being done by ToppyNoppy toys, and the finals will look a lot like their other products (click here to check them out). Should be neat! An official SkateBIRD fingerboard! These are going to be sick. The idea is to give you the ""omg I just got a new skateboard!"" experience, but on a micro-scale. You'll get it unassembled, with the necessary tools, and you get to build it! We've done tests (click for in-progress photos) with cheaper boards, but eh, they're cheap. We want something nicer. The Bird Sized Box is a cassette tape... that's actually a USB key! It'll have the full DRM-free build of the game pre-loaded, as well as some secret bonuses only the holders of the tapes shall see. The picture is of a test print - the version you get will have slightly better art. Become an official SkateBIRD Skate Pro! Pros get their own cover on Thrusher: the premier magazine for skateboarding birders. The way this works is simple, you just get us pictures. You can be holding a skateboard, actually doing a cool trick, or even just standing somewhere that looks skateable. You can also give us pictures of your birb, if they're the real SkateBIRD Pro in your family. Then, TADA! You get hi-res copies, if you want to print it. SkateBIRD Skate Pro covers are also featured in-game (unless you ask us not to), so you actually become a part of SkateBIRD's world. There's magazines leaned against walls, making tiny quarter pipes - they pop up in all sorts of places. You'd be one or more of those! We can also (if you like), turn Birb Pros into quest givers, and add your birb to the playable species but please, message us before you assume that. It'll depend a lot on bird species. Some don't work in the game, some would require adjustments, etc. We can make any bird into a Skate Pro magazine, we just can't guarantee birbs as playable unless you ask first. We're gonna play with some options here, and we're going to start with stencils and paint. Make it a custom job. That would end up looking a lot like the above, though we're likely to try screen printing in our garage as well. The goal is something that feels custom, while still being something you could imagine a sponsored little birb having as their signature board. Please note: ""Hit The Deck"" tier is not a fully set up board. That means no wheels, no metal parts. It's just the wood top (deck), also no grip surface (grip tape) unless you ask us. Now for Big Friend's Board and Coach's Board, the difference is they're already setup. That means they have trucks, wheels, grip-tape, etc. They're ready to ride. We'll also give the option of choosing truck and wheel color, but we can't guarantee matching perfectly. We're going through our local skate shop to help the small biz, so we'll work with what they have. The video proof will involve Megan (hi again!) and Chris. Megan is Big Friend, Chris is Coach. You ask us what trick you'd like us to do, and, well... Chris will probably be able to do it. I will look at you funny, and... well... try my best! But probably will just fall off the board. Wishing for a sticker tier? Don't need one. @KnuckleCrackle put the stickers up to just BUY! When I say I (it's also Megan writing this, hi!) do a lot of what you see, a lot of that is just leveraging stuff I found elsewhere. Or it's on the shoulders of people like Federico, who helped me a ton with logo design and branding. Media likes solo production stories (which barely applies) or Auteurs (which I guess I am?), but games are almost always a team effort! ... and that's just the folks I can put a clear name to. Anyways, team effort. Hooray! We funded Hot Tin Roof via Kickstarter, and that went pretty well. Game launched, everyone got their stuff, fun was had. We could try a publisher or other funder (we did IndieFund for our last game), but it isn't as nice. You don't get the community feedback, and you definitely don't get a good excuse to make silly stuff like actual skateboards or papercraft playsets. Basically? This is more fun. Let's do it again! Believe it or not, we really can finish the game on $20k. That gets us to, roughly, late Q1/early Q2 2020, which is about when we want to launch SkateBIRD. All the reward tiers say June, but ideally we'd launch a bit earlier than that. We're not giving a more specific date because, depending on how this funds, we may expand scope slightly, which would bump the release date back some. We want to make it clear, though, that we aren't going to run up stretch-goals forever. If, somehow, this makes it past $100k? We're not doing any more stretch goals past that. We've seen how expanding scope can destroy a game, and SkateBIRD needs to stay small and cozy to be true to birbs. That's all, pardner! (birb likes to pretend they're a cowboy sometimes)"

His assistant general counsel filed a complaint about a 4-minute clip of my film but, thankfully, YouTube did the right thing and rejected their bogus claim of copyright infringement. Please defy the wishes of Joel Osteen and his lawyers and see my short film! The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen is a short film that contrasts two very different understandings of Jesus and the significance of his life and death. The two viewpoints represented in my film are those of megachurch minister Joel Osteen and legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. My film's audio consists of a Joel Osteen sermon called ""It's Already Set Up."" The visual content comes from The Last Temptation of Christ, Martin Scorsese's challenging and wonderful film. I made The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen to contrast Osteen's and Scorsese's wildly differing views about the person of Jesus, the significance of faith, and the meanings of courage, strength, and sacrifice. You can see more of the film here: The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen. I'm very excited about entering The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen into as many as ten or twelve film festivals in the near future. (I've already entered it in eight festivals: the Nashville FF, the Denver FF, the Religion Today FF, the Oxford FF, the Blowup Int Arthouse FF, the San Diego Int FF, the Traverse City FF, & the Santa Fe Int FF.) For each festival there are entry fees. And of course I'm hoping that The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen will be accepted to screen at several festivals -- and therein lies a problem: the expense of DCPs. Many festivals require a Digital Cinema Package in order to publicly screen a film. DCPs may cost between $1,000 and $3,000 (https://indiefilmhustle.com/dcp-digital-cinema-package/), and as a retired schoolteacher that is quite a steep expense for me. Also, I'd like to attend one or more festivals that screen my film, so your financial support would be most gratefully appreciated! If you pledge support and for any reason are less than satisfied with The Last Temptation of Joel Osteen, just let me know and I'll gladly refund your money.

It spans nine miles north to south, and six miles east to west. Roughly 114,000 residents live within its borders and call it home. If you ever had the time or energy to walk every street in this city, you would walk about 537 miles. You would witness the softly swaying corn fields on the south-eastern edge in the summer months, where it's evident that nearby Michigan State University agriculture plays an active part in the environment. You would be surprised to see the bungalow-style homes deep set on multiple acres near the man-made Jones Lake, on the north side. You would spy urban gardens, graffiti, and dead-end streets, with winding paths that stretch out into the woods. The bustle of downtown Lansing would draw you in with its loud sounds, monolithic government buildings, and historical statues. You would smell QD donuts filling the foggy air on early October mornings, and see flocks of geese cluster together on the Red Cedar in the deep winter. You would hear cartoons on TVs, dogs barking, and sometimes heated arguments. Many times you would meet people out walking, some for exercise and some because they had no other way to get around. Have you ever wanted to understand, see, and experience your city to such completeness that you knew about every event, every neighborhood, every park, and every street? Have you ever wanted to explore the areas unfamiliar to you, to see what maybe you'd been missing? Have you ever wanted to feel you're making a difference, meet people who are making a difference, and be excited about where you live? I know I did. You probably don't have time to make your way through the city in such a way. Let me take you on this journey and do the legwork for you. While sipping your favorite beverage, on your most comfortable chair, you can experience what it was like to travel for three years through this ""Little Big City,"" street after street. You can read about this journey of learning to walk safely, join groups, and experience this lovely city to its wholeness. You can enjoy the beautiful photographs created through these walks, season after season. Through the City Saunter Project, a time stamp of Lansing was made. The time�2010 through 2013. An era when General Motors began to falter, causing dramatic repercussions throughout the city. A moment when Lansing Public Schools began to break. It was a time before REO Town was drawing crowds in for fresh brewed coffee and lip-smacking BBQ. All of these finds were captured through stories and photographs. Although my journey began as an effort to help lead Lansing out of the Great Recession, it became a much bigger life lesson of community, volunteerism, and urban development. A City Saunter Story is the book of that journey. A City Saunter Story cover The City Saunter Project is the second, companion book to the story. It showcases original blogs from the project and many photographs that complement those blog stories. This photo art book will be an 8x10 hardcover book, printed on high-quality paper, in full color. The City Saunter Project photo book cover Both books will let you explore a quaint mid western town in such a thorough and meticulous way, few could ever duplicate it. The Process. What's Left? Each book has been edited multiple times and is formatted for self-publishing. At the end of the campaign, the hard-cover books will be printed. These books will then be shipped out to those not in the area, or to those who request shipping. All other reward options will be fulfilled as soon as possible, depending on which category selected. To learn more about this project, please go here. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! Thank you for your support Without your continued support for this project, I wouldn't have been able to make it a reality. This adventure is your adventure. Without so many #LoveLansing folks out there doing amazing things, there wouldn't have been a story to tell. Thank you all for supporting this crazy idea, for following it through with me, for walking with me, photographing with me, and cheering with me. It has been an amazing journey, and I can't wait for you to read all about it! Thank you for supporting this project! Sincerely, Ariniko"

Last year we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to create a Pathfinder version of Marek's Haunted House. Those modules went out to backers last year. This Kickstarter is to convert that adventure module into 5E rules for Dungeons & Dragons players. A haunted house. An ancient evil released. Restless tormented spirits. A malevolent cult. Mystery, horror, adventure, fighting, secrets. Marek's Haunted House is a Halloween / Horror inspired mix of all of these things. Will your players discover the ancient evil? Will they banish it from this world, or will they befriend it? A Pick Up and Play Adventure Marek's Haunted House is designed to be a Pick Up and Play Adventure. What do we mean by that? There are a lot of great adventure modules out there, but many of them require you to spend a fair amount of time reading the module before you run it. That is great, when you have the time. But we know that life gets busy. Sometimes, you don't have the time to read a whole module before you run it. Sometimes you just want to pick up a module, and be able to run it right away with your friends. That's where we come in. Marek's Haunted House is designed to be played with only a few minutes of preparation. Key points, skill checks, items, and decisions; stand out in bold text so you can quickly find what you need. Skill check successes and failures are clearly set in boxes to make it easy and fast to find the text/results you need. No more fishing through paragraphs of text to try and find key points. But don't just take our word for it, see some of our page examples below. Marek's Haunted House was designed and play tested for groups from level 3 to level 5. Feel free though to make the monsters/skill checks easier or more difficult to custom tailor play for characters of any level. We believe in the design philosophy that the module is a suggested story, which the DM can take as is, or change in any way they see fit. You are the captain of this adventure. Below is a link to one of our free modules, The Wild Wolves of East Wood. It is about half the size of Marek's Haunted House. It's yours to keep at no cost, as a way to see how we lay out our adventures. Wild Wolves of East Wood Wild Wolves of East Wood Map Pack We plan on delivering the PDF via DriveThruRPG. Thank you for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter."

What's not to love? But heists can be hard to write and even harder to pull off properly. They take almost as much work as the real thing to plan, and that can bring your campaign to a grinding halt. Lucky for you, The San Jenaro Co-Op is here to help. The Roleplayer�s Guide To Heists is a system agnostic collection of around 25 heists ranging from your standard bank jobs, to space-based sci-fi capers, to fantasy smash-jobs into a wizard�s mind-realm. If you like stealing stuff (in games) and getting away with it (again, in the game), this book will have everything you could want! Each heist comes complete with a detailed map of the joint for you to properly case; oodles of scene hooks, enemies and traps, ideas for the getaway and of course the loot itself. As if that wasn�t enough, you can also look forward to essays on the finer points of thieving, heists and their narrative function. The Rouge Theater from Lights, Camera, Action! We put together a small 3 heist taster of what you can expect from the project that you can download for free right here! It contains The Shuttle Game - a thrilling modern day mission to steal a space shuttle, A Wizard Did It - a fantasy heist set inside a dimension-shifting Wizard�s Tower, and Lights, Camera, Action! - a retro robbery set during a film premiere in the golden age of Hollywood! It also contains the essay Making Your MacGuffin Matter, one of many essays we intend to include in the final book to make sure you're fully equipped to run the very best heists in TTRPG history! This preview contains placeholder graphics and layout and is designed to give you an idea of what we�re making, not to represent the final product.

Photography by Ajja DeShayne �It means giving the professional dancers from and of Maui the platform to share their craft and inspiration with their community, their home. It means lifting our youth up and showing them their potential.� -ADT Co-Artistic Director, Hallie Hunt What is Bring it Home? Bring it Home (BiH) is Adaptations Dance Theater�s annual residency and dance concert that brings home Maui-raised dancers who have left the island in pursuit of professional careers elsewhere to come home and collaborate with local artists to create and share original works of contemporary dance with their island community. BiH is an intensive one-month residency that brings together these artists in a thrilling collaboration that demonstrates the homegrown talent and inspiring artistry found in the middle of the Pacific. It is ADT's way to build a bridge and facilitate a constant exchange of contemporary dance between the island of Maui, the U.S. mainland, and beyond. Through this process, BiH offers the opportunity for Maui audiences to regularly experience world-renowned dance that is uniquely influenced by our island home. Even though the BiH process lasts only a month, ADT works year-round to produce this program. The effort has an invaluable effect on Maui's current and future dancers who get to see professionals practicing their craft right at home. Seeing these artists onstage demonstrates what is possible for the hundreds of student dancers currently training at Maui�s dance academies, breaking away at the perception that they must leave their home in order to pursue careers in dance. Now in its fourth year, BiH features its largest cast of 18 dancers in various stages of their careers, from those earning advanced degrees in dance at esteemed college programs, to those active professionals working in dance companies, creating their own works, and practicing full-time dance careers. The residency begins July 5, culminating in three performances over the weekend of August 2-4 at Seabury Hall�s �A�ali�ikhonua Creative Arts Center (7:30pm each night). A new development for 2019, ADT is thrilled to welcome guest company FLOCK to join the BiH 'ohana. Co-created by Alice Klock and Florian Lochner�two Chicago-based artists who formerly danced and served as choreographic fellows at Hubbard Street Dance Chicago�FLOCK will create an original work on the BiH 2019 cast, as well as perform a piece from their repertoire. ADT is incredibly excited to work with FLOCK for BiH 2019, thereby strengthening the connection between Hawai'i's dancers and esteemed artists from around the world. If the thought of any of this excites you, we ask that you donate whatever amount possible to help support our non-profit company produce Bring It Home for a fourth year! Every donation makes a huge difference, and every person who believes in our mission helps to elevate our company and our vision to even greater heights! Photography by Ajja DeShayne ""I believe Bring it Home is a celebration of community, and is therefore a show that welcomes every type of audience member and viewer regardless of previous experience or exposure to dance. My wish for the Maui community is that this show allows them to step outside of themselves and be moved by the profound stories being told through movement."" -Ali McKeon, BiH 2016-19 Performer and 2017-18 Choreographer Who are we? A d a p t a t i o n s D a n c e T h e a t e r Photography by Ajja DeShayne Through creativity, collaboration, and performance, Adaptations Dance Theater (ADT)'s mission is to inspire and develop a culturally-dynamic and continually growing community of dance on Maui. ADT strives to contribute to and sustain the art movement in Hawai'i by offering a home to professional, contemporary dancers, whether trained locally or abroad. Founded in 2013 by Amelia Couture, Hallie Hunt, Vanessa Cerrito, and Nicole Humphrey, Adaptations Dance Theater aspires to create groundbreaking work in Hawai'i that sparks new energy in the dance community. By producing original works of art and creating professional performance opportunities on an annual basis, ADT addresses a specific need in its community for a permanent residence for professional dance artists, and a space where the general public can regularly experience this level of performance art. ADT produces its annual Bring it Home dance concert series in the summer, and its community-centered Dance Maui performance festival where the many culturally-diverse dance organizations of Maui are given a platform to present their art as one dance community each fall. Additionally, ADT's education and community outreach initiatives, such as the ADT Apprenticeship program and monthly Master Class series, provide Maui's intermediate and advanced dancers the opportunity to further develop their training and enhance their relationship with their own artistic expression. ADT programs seek to relay universal human experiences expressed through the visceral form of dance. ADT is proud to be a part of the vibrant arts community on Maui and strives to contribute to the creativity, education, and inspiration of future dancers and art advocates.

Spring-heeled Jack (London), Cropsey (Staten Island), or Slenderman (Waukesha). In 2018 Maryland�s terrifying legend of Peeping Tom was brought to light with director Erik Kristopher Myer�s award winning horror mockumentary Butterfly Kisses. With Myer�s efforts as well as the tireless investigatory work of documentary film maker Crane Peeping Tom aka The Blink Man is finally becoming a household name and a warning to anyone who ignores it. Now, we are very lucky to have been given the opportunity to have an authorized collection of stories and experiences on The Blink Man that explores and expands on the years of research and first hand accounts by historians, authors and survivors. All of the stories are expertly written and ready to be bound in our beautifully designed book making it the most perfect and definitive tome on an urban legend to date. multiple screenings and glowing reviews have made Butterfly Kisses and The Blink Man one of the most impactful entrees in the found footage subgenre since The Blair Witch Released in 2018, Butterfly Kisses is an award winning and critically acclaimed horror film / documentary that deconstructs and reinvents the found footage genre. It documents the journey of Gavin York, an aspiring film maker who stumbles across footage left behind by two film students who faced a monstrous urban legend and were never seen again. Butterfly Kisses has a growing fanbase and worldwide distribution through Gravitas Ventures. In Elliott City, Maryland, there is an old railway tunnel, The Ilchester Tunnel, and if you manage to stare down to the other for an entire hour up to midnight, without blinking, it will summon Peeping Tom, The Blink Man. Once summoned, The Blink Man will watch over you, standing silently but getting closer each time you blink until his eyelashes are touching yours. The Ilchester Tunnel, Maryland location of the legend of The Blink Man. ""According to playground historians, if a person stands at the far side of the trestle spanning the Patapsco River at exactly midnight, and if he or she possesses the strength of will to stare into Ilchester Tunnel without blinking their eyes for one uninterrupted hour, they will see Peeping Tom appear at the tunnel's far end."" Quote from CreepyPasta.org Click on the image to read in it's entirety. Throughout history many people have been foolish or unfortunate enough to cross paths with The Blink Man, but who is he, how long has he been here and why, the questions brought up in Erik Kristopher Myer�s Butterfly Kisses, can finally be revealed. Since the release of Erik Kristopher Myers' award winning mockumentary more and more stories and experiences of The Blink Man have emerged and thanks to the efforts of an international group of writers, poets and historians we have managed to combine all these stories into one passionately constructed tome. Several tales inspired by local history, legends and superstition surrounding the cursed Ellicott City. A professor, brought to Ellicott City to lecture on the phenomenon of 'flickering spirits'. A troubled man's life takes a turn for the worse when a local shopkeeper leads him to a terrifying encounter. Folklore expert Matt Lake receives a mysterious old poem that appears to tell the tale of someone who once encountered the Blink Man. A cheating husband's attempt to bid a permanent farewell to his wife descends into madness and death. A holy man journeys to the Ilchester Tunnel and sees an awful figure off in the distance. A reckless teen questions the choices that brought him face to face with his own destruction. A man traumatized by war turns to a hypnotist for relief with horrifying consequences. A student has good reason to believe that her favorite teacher's untimely death wasn't suicide. Police detectives investigate the disappearance of a survey team at the site of the Ilchester tunnel. Research into the tunnel reveals some startling anomalies. And a seemingly accidental car accident ties back to the Ilchester Tunnel and the infamous Blink Man.

""I've been a huge fan of Butterfly Kisses and the idea of The Blink Man since the first moment I watched it. Found footage can be very polarising subgenre but when it is done right it can make a huge impact. Similar to Blair Witch and it's mysterious stick figures Butterfly Kisses offers enough visual iconography that it's frighteningly easy to expand on that world. As rich, dynamic and enticing as the cover is, it is constructed purely from the key elements of the legend repeated over and over again demanding to have more added to it until it becomes a struggle to stop.""

Patrick Glover was inspired by Erik Kristopher Myer's Butterfly Kisses and discussed the opportunity to combine all of the stories in one definitive tome. ""With a tale as rich and open as what filmmaker Erik Kristopher Myers has created in Butterfly Kisses, it was easy to see the potential for more stories delving into the legend of The Blink Man and the history of the haunted Ilchester Tunnel. I talked it over with Erik and fortunately, he agreed. So we started talking to writers, both here in Baltimore and abroad, and we've put together a collection of amazing stories, each set in a different time period, that weave together a kind of history of the horror unleashed in that tunnel.""

Think Lord of the Rings, meets Knights of the Roundtable. Top 5 on Amazon Bestseller Goodreads Reader Choice Award Tens of thousands of copies sold The Ronin were legendary heroes--warriors that guarded the nine Great Kingdoms. But now they're just dark rumors, bards tales told in cozy amber lit inns. Dark stories told to children of fallen heroes who turned on those they were meant to protect and nearly destroyed the world. Gray, Ayva and Darius don't buy the dark tales. But they have to hope they're right... When out of the shadows the legends return, wreathed in flames, water, stone, moon, sun, leaf, and even flesh and metal, Gray and his friends discover they are the dark legends reborn.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 My Story The Ronin Saga in Audiobook form! Yes! But why only now? And why kickstarter? I'm truly excited for this, but the reason why I'm doing this Kickstarter needs a little backstory... The Knife's Edge was published in 2015 and to my sheer luck and fortune, it hit the Top 5 on Amazon for Fantasy. At the same time, I saw other authors in my same fantasy field like Michael J. Sullivan, and Brandon Sanderson hitting the Audiobooks hard and thought I should follow suit, but I dismissed it as a ""I'll do it tomorrow"". I didn't. Then I grew guilty and shrugged my shoulders at audiobooks for a while. As a result, I saw my sales do well, then grow sluggish. Meanwhile, audiobooks have only grown into a giant. Instead I devoted my time to meeting fans, continuing the saga. I traveled all over the US and met a lot of amazing people and sold a lot of books. However, all the while people would ask me with ever increasing frequency: ""Do you have audiobooks?"" But I didn't. And I knew I was crippling my sales and my audience as a result. Why? The truth is I wanted audiobooks, but I felt guilty and thought I missed the bus. If I could go back and change one thing, it would be doing this earlier. But as I grew a larger dedicated fanbase, and began to listen almost constantly to audiobooks myself, I realized I could ignore the 2015's mistake no longer. It was audiobook time. Still, I don't want to publish something mediocre. If I was going to do an audiobook and catch up, I want to do it right, and it would be with my IDEAL narrator. I've long had my ear on one. After listening to countless fantasy audiobooks there was one voice who over and over again stood out. Tim Gerard Reynolds. However, Tim isn't cheap. His skills are practically as legendary as the Ronin themselves. That's where you come in! How Much? I'm all about 100% clear transparency. I've talked with his producers and we've finalized a price at an approximate 12 hrs, which will be $600 per finished hour (i.e. The Knifes Edge = 120k words = ~12.25 finished hours = $7,350). So why only 4000? Well, I'm just hoping for enough funds to cover a good portion of the total amount. I'll do my best to cover the rest. More importantly, I'm hoping we hit it early so I can roll out some very exciting Stretch Goals. Stretch Goals Here's where it becomes real fun. If we succeed, then I'll look to producing Citadel of Fire and Bastion of Sun, and even other short stories as Audiobooks. Note: For backing at $39 or above you get ALL Stretch Goals for free!

Also, yes, by backing you will be able to download all the books onto audible for free :D Oh ya, who is Tim Gerard Reynolds and why is he so special? Well, if I have a talented hopefully it's a knack for words. My second and arguably even greater talent is finding amazing talent/artists and the like. Just like when I was able to recruit acclaimed artist Noah Bradley, artist for Magic the Gathering, and the very talented Flavio Bolla to our team for artists, I want it done right. Tim is amazing. Here's some of Tim's many accolades: Tim Gerard Reynolds is a best-selling audiobook narrator with 300+ titles recorded. He has narrated a diverse range of genres, and in 2016 he was awarded a listener-voted Reddit ""Stabby"" Award for his contributions, in particular, to the Fantasy genre. Tim is nominated for Best Performance by a Male Narrator in the 2019 Audie Awards Previously been a 5-time Audie Nominee. He is the recipient of multiple Audiofile Earphones Awards and has twice been listed in Audiofile Magazine's Best of the Year. Books he narrated were among Audible.com's Best of the Year from 2014 through 2017 consecutively. Among the 2016 Fantasy audiobook best-sellers, Tim read 3 out of the top 5 books. He has narrated books by Salman Rushdie, Colm T�b�n, Michael J. Sullivan, Mike McCormack, Pierce Brown and Caleb Carr, among others in contemporary literature, as well as classics such as R.D. Blackmore�s Lorna Doone, and Lewis Carroll�s Alice in Wonderland. Tim has also been part of notable collaborations such has the re-release of Margaret Attwood's The Handmaid's Tale Here's a sample from him: https://www.recordedbooks.com/Browse/Featured-Narrators/Tim-Gerard-Reynolds For more: https://www.timgerardreynolds.com/ Farhaven - The Magical Realm of The Ronin Saga Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you.

This short film won the Best Dark Comedy award for the annual IMDB Independent Short Film Festival and was screened in Burbank California last May. The name of our next film is HOOT. It�s a dark comedy about a woman named Lacy who comes home to find her husband Dan has disappeared. When Lacy begins looking for her husband in the woods she finds something completely unexpected. There are some really funny characters filled by a great local cast and basically the same crew that brought you 'Motel Night.' 'HOOT' is sure to be a hoot! The inspiration for ""Hoot' came from an image writer Doug Underwood saw on a film festival website. The idea popped in his head. He typed the synopsis on his cell phone and a few hours later the story was a ten page script. We are currently in the last portions of pre-production. Our locations are set and we are preparing props and costumes. Doug and Travis with crew members Kevin McGee, Tristan Seigfried, and Anthony Fraccastoro have all done several projects together before but for this project we plan to shoot with Anamorphic lenses. ""As independent film makers we have adapted and overcome."" Our Anamorphic Lens Solution Anamorphic lenses, not to be confused with amphibious lenses give the image a really great cinematic look. A lot of your favorite movies have been shot with these types of lenses which normally you only see used in big budget productions. Just to rent one of these lenses for a three day shoot would be well over a thousand dollars. To rent a camera that could even use these types of lenses properly is more than double that. In short it�s expensive. However, as independent film makers we have adapted and overcome. With the help of the internet Travis found a work-around that produces the same quality image for a fraction of the price. With parts shipped from all over the world like Indonesia, China, and even mother Russia, we made it happen. Sadly there�s still a few small parts and pieces we need. This is another one of the reasons we're asking for your help. Your donations to this project will help us tremendously. Not only on this film but all of our future projects as we continue to create high quality films. The look of and sound HOOT. When DP Travis Myers and Director Doug Underwood first talked about the look of the film, two examples came up. John Krasinski's 2018 horror film 'A Quiet Place' and the high acclaimed Netflix series 'Stranger Things'. 'A Quiet Place' 2018 Paramount Pictures Both films are solid examples of the style, look and feel desired for 'Hoot'. The use of the anamorphic lense lends alot to this but the real magic comes in the post-production of editing and color grading. For this we hope to exceed our goal allowing the hiring of an editor with lights years more experience in finding the tone and over all look of the project. 'Stranger Things' 2016 A bonus to these two examples besides the visual appearance is they each have a unique sound from foley to original music. In our humble opinion nothing takes you out of a film faster than poor sound and music. There are tons of men and women out there who specialize in composing and recording outstanding tracks that elevate any sequence and with your help we can bring them on board. While we already have lots of great talent and support we still need you help. So were asking you to consider joining us with this Kickstarter campaign. Our all-in budget for this film is $2000. We can make the project work with a minimum of $1500 to pay our cast and crew, purchase costumes, location fees, food and drinks and any rentals. Anything exceeding the $1500 or even the $2000 goes directly to the production value of the film. Professional editors, Composers and Gear only makes your film the best we can produce. Thanks for your help!"

In addition to Antique Silver, the following metals/finishes have been unlocked: Antique Brass-Plated Steel NOW UNLOCKED!! Antique Bronze NOW UNLOCKED!! Antique Copper (1 Troy ounce of solid copper) NOW UNLOCKED!! What are Hobo Coins? Throughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. This form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression, and has been popular ever since. Over time, these 'Hobo Coins' started to incorporate skeletons or skulls, while keeping aspects of the original coins (usually the identifying text and coin date) intact in the final design. This project is the third in my series of Hobo Coins�and this time there's a unifying theme to all the designs. Each of the coins was inspired by classic rock songs from the late 60s and early 70s. I designed each of the coins to fit the lyrics of the songs, and the year of the coin is also the year of the song's first release (more on each below). I should probably mention that the songs only served as the inspiration for these new, original artworks and this project is not associated with any of the song creators�other than that they inspired me to create these designs. While I'm on the topic of disclaimers, it's also important to note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins. They are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins. Each coin comes wrapped from the mint in a protective plastic bag, which we then place in a protective coin envelope. All coins (and finishes), are brass-alloy, solid metal coins that are die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure. The coins are also finished with a lacquer that protects the coins over time. They will patina, but much slower than most coins. This also protects the antique finish for longer. The Designs Taking on something as rich and varied as ""classic rock"" as a theme was a little daunting - there so many amazing songs, legendary bands, and creative options! I realized early on that I couldn't aim for anything close to being comprehensive, but I did have some help picking the songs along the way. First off, I focused on ""1st Generation"" songs and bands. That helped narrow the field to songs released in the late 60s to early 70s. Second, I thought about songs and bands that meant a lot to me personally. Lastly, and most importantly, the lyrics of the songs had to lend themselves to powerful visual representations. There's some great songs from the time, that mean a lot to me personally, but whose lyrics don't translate easily to a coin design. So I ended up with a list of about 8-10 front-runners, but was able to narrow it down further to these four. I know if you like the project, you'll probably be thinking ""why didn't he pick *THIS* song?"" Fair enough, but I figured I would at least tell you a little about the process that went into the decisions. And hopefully this is just the first of these types of coins, I'd REALLY like to design more. All that said, here are the coin designs. The White Rabbit | 1967 Nickel, 39mm The song was first released by Jefferson Airplane in 1967, and quickly became synonymous with the growing San Francisco counter-culture. Featuring a skeletal, bohemian 'Alice' on the front, and the namesake White Rabbit on the back. Like a certain Doctor said, when that note peaks, throw the radio in the tub! The White Rabbit, front, based on the 1967 Nickel. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The White Rabbit, back, based on the 1967 Nickel. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Midnight Rider | 1971 Silver Dollar, 39mm Of course it's a silver dollar, I mean, come on! This coin practically designed itself, with a Midnight Rider on the front being pursued by the police on the back�because, you know, they're never going to catch him! Why the Macon Police? Though originally from Florida, the Allman Brothers lived in Macon, Georgia at the time of this songs composition and release. The Midnight Rider, front, based on the 1971 Silver Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Midnight Rider, back, based on the 1971 Silver Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Watchtower | 1968 Half Dollar, 39mm Originally written by Bob Dylan (off John Wesley Harding, amazing album in its own right), this coin was inspired by the much better known 1968 Hendrix cover of the song. Even when playing his own song, Dylan has said ""I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way."" Designed with the Joker on the front, and backed up by the Thief and the Watchtower on the obverse side, this is my tribute to one of the defining songs of the era. The Watchtower, front, based on the 1968 Half Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Watchtower, back, based on the 1968 Half Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Hammer of the Gods | 1970 Quarter Dollar, 39mm I would gladly mortgage my house (and maybe sell an organ or two), to go back in time and be front-stage at one of their concerts. Led Zeppelin set the bar for classic rock, so of course I had to design a coin inspired by them. Immigrant Song tells the tale of nordic conquerors, and that's the inspiration for the The Hammer of the Gods quarter dollar with an skeletal overlord warrior on the front and Mj�lnir (the literal hammer of a god), cracking the coin's back. If you can't die with a sword in hand, this coin could help get you to Valhalla. (full disclaimer�it won't). The Hammer of the Gods, front, based on the 1970 Quarter Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The Hammer of the Gods, back, based on the 1970 Quarter Dollar. Shown here in Antique Silver. Please note that all images are comps and the actual coins may vary slightly. The 'Biker' Limited Edition Print As I've done with each Hobo Coins project, I've again designed a limited edition print to complement the coins. Going with the Classic Rock theme, I designed this print to be a 'concert poster' of a sort. I drew inspiration from the early 60s op-art works of Bridget Riley and merged that approach with my own engraved style. Type-wise, I married that up with a Lance Wyman inspired typeface. Tying it together is a main figure of a proud 60s biker. Each print is 18� x 24�, signed, and numbered, and printed on museum-grade, archival stock. 'Biker' 18"" x 24"" Original print on museum-grade paper, signed and numbered in a limited edition. Here's a detail of the print... Add-ons All Add-ons are immediately available (including Solid Silver coins). Additional coins or posters can be added to any base pledge as needed.

Unleash a Flying, Flipping, Spinning Kick on your opponents, but be careful to hang onto a Block or two for when they try to do the same to you! As SlugFest's first published game, Kung Fu Fighting has always held a special place in our hearts and the hearts of our longtime fans. This exciting card game hit a really good sweet spot as a quick and light game that still had some interesting choices and lots of silly, over-the-top cinematic Kung Fu moments. A typically over-the-top attack. So after it was out of print we tried to Kickstart a totally new edition: fancy art, overhauled mechanics, higher production value, etc. Response was overwhelmingly meh. Since that failed project, we've thought a lot about this game, and we still get occasional requests for reprints. After the success of our low-key print-on-demand version of En Garde Reforged, we decided we should do the same thing for Kung Fu Fighting. We are very much using the KISS principle for this project: Keep It Simple, SlugFest! Rather than redoing everything (art, mechanics, etc.), we are simply creating a lightly-updated set of cards with the original art and mechanics and sending that off to our friends at DriveThruCards for printing. However, as with the En Garde Reforged campaign, we have one stretch goal. If we pass $30k, we will do a manufacturing print run of the game instead. It will still be the lightly-updated original game, however. (For our previous Kung Fu Fighting campaign we underestimated the amount of love that was out there for the original version!) As with our En Garde Reforged campaign, we can offer you the game right now, in a very functional, if minimalist way. Our colleagues at DriveThruCards do great, reliable work and are ready to publish this game through their print-on-demand services. In essence, your pledge of support is a pre-order for the new print-on-demand version of the game, consisting of: Kung Fu Fighting deck More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play 6 mini-player mats 2 large plastic deck boxes (the game is too big for just one!) The rules will be available online and you will need to supply 6 objects to use as Chi Tokens (which conveniently fit in the deck boxes!). If demand for the game is high enough, then instead of offering a minimalist print-on-demand version of the game, we will manufacture a full production run of the game! Allow us to introduce you to our one and only over-funding milestone: the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal! As you can see, we do not have an all-or-nothing initial funding level. We can create and deliver the print-on-demand version of the game with even just a single backer. What this Kickstarter campaign is all about, however, is whether or not we can get enough folks interested in the game to elevate it to the next level, taking it from print-on-demand to full manufacturing. Therefore, there are no nickel and dime micro-upgrades with dozens of micro-goals like you might expect from traditional board game campaigns. We only need one, all-or-nothing stretch goal: If we can raise $30,000 everyone's rewards upgrade for free, becoming a manufactured version of Kung Fu Fighting with all the bells and whistles, including: Kung Fu Fighting deck More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play 6 full-size player mats 6 Chi Markers 1 Game Box with Cover Art Rules This upgrade includes all the usual micro-goals you usually see from other campaigns: improved box, glossy rules, token upgrades, etc. Best of all, even if we don�t hit the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, everyone will still be getting a great game (and, as a consolation prize, they'll be getting it way ahead of schedule)! The unique nature of this campaign has some big ramifications on the estimated delivery date for the rewards. If we do not reach the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, we will ship rewards as soon as the campaign funds become available. Therefore, we actually have two estimated delivery dates: If we receive <$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by August 2019. If we receive >$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by February 2020. Because we can only list one estimated delivery date on the pledge levels we can offer, we opted to use the farthest out date. Backers are required to fulfill all of their regional obligations for import. Unfortunately, there is no region-friendly shipping for this project. In addition, we should note here that we will not be using a pledge manager for this project. Interested in picking up some of our other games? Then head on over to SlugFestGames.com where you can get all of our games right now! Best of all, we are offering free domestic shipping on all orders placed during the campaign!"

We're launching this Kickstarter so you can help us build a brand new store and community on the Upper East Side, at 1462 First Avenue. Family-Friendly. Our space is a place for everyone! In addition to keeping a large number of family-oriented games in our library, we'll also offer family and kid-only programs. We're bringing The Brooklyn Strategist�s wildly successful after school enrichment and summer camp programs to our store, too. The program teaches children to think critically and be confident in their decision-making using a wide range of board games! Events and Programs. We'll build on the existing New York Magic: The Gathering and Tabletop RPG communities by giving the Upper East Side a chance to join in on the fun. We�ll run Magic events weekly and offer new tabletop players the chance to learn how to play games like Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder from our experienced game masters. A Great Place to Play. Everything about the new store, from the lighting and the furniture arrangement, will be designed to maximize your play experience. We're working with a sculptor and set designer to make this space the most engaging and fun it can be. Great Food. Alright, this one isn�t about building a community so much, but we�re REALLY excited about our food menu. We�re adding fresh ingredients, house-smoked meats, and grilled pizzas. Great Drink. Our coffee is from Brooklyn Roasting Company, and our tea is from Harney & Sons. Beer and cider enthusiasts have always found a home at our current location, with over 30 options to choose from. We'll be taking all of that with us to the East Side, except we're adding a cocktail menu and milkshakes. Three words: Mini Donut Machine. Starting a business is a lot of work. It's a lot of paperwork: licenses and fees and consultations and permits. Our Upper East Side location is happening no matter what, but after focusing our funds and efforts on all of the above, we need some help to make the space the best it can be. That means filling out our game library, improving upon our space, and adding all the really cool things we've always wanted to add. Yes, that (hopefully) means a Mini Donut Machine.

This money covers rounding out our board game library, new aesthetic and artistic additions to the space, and all the other finishing touches.

The Game Guru is an expert in board gaming who can make sure you get the most out of your Hex experience by recommending and teaching you new games. The Hex & Company team is comprised of: Greg May founded The Uncommons- the first board game cafe in Manhattan- after noticing that tabletop gaming lacked a community home. Originally from small town Iowa, Greg has worked in everything from food journalism to photography to the Silicon Valley startup scene, while living around the world, from Beijing to Honolulu. Board games, coffee, and beer were always passions, and when the former Village Chess Shop space became available, he decided to combine them. The Uncommons has become a neighborhood fixture, and has been featured everywhere from the New York Times to The New Yorker. Mark Miller is nothing if not persistent. Riding the occasional good idea, he has produced new methods for curing and hot smoking salmon, 4 internationally acclaimed CDs of American Roots Music, and over 100 16 and 32 bit video game soundtracks. He has a degree in Comparative Religions and Ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University and an eMBA from Northeastern University. He is greatly looking forward to smoking delicious things for patrons at Hex & Company. Dr. Jon Freeman is the founder of The Brooklyn Strategist. Dr. Jon brings to Hex & Company his proud blend of clinical neuroscience nerdiness and his love and passion of board games (more nerdiness). His acclaimed after school and camp enrichment programs that promote neurodevelopment and social responsibility through game play is a cornerstone feature of Hex & Company�s milieu. For Jon, Hex & Company represents the ultimate community space � a safe environment where people can be themselves, meet new friends and engage wits in a healthy and spirited fashion. Will Horowitz is a consultant on the new Hex & Company menu. He is the chef & co-owner of restaurants Ducks Eatery and Harry & Ida�s meat and supply co. both located in the East Village of NYC. He is the author of �Salt Smoke Time� with Harper-Collins and co-founder of seaweed company Akua. By supporting this Kickstarter, you'll be sending a very clear message about what kinds of spaces you want to see in your neighborhood. We're honored you want to help us build this space, and we can't wait to get it up on its feet. Every donation counts! If you can't donate, talking up this Kickstarter with your friends and on social media will help get the word out.

You might find that some jobs aren't always what you'd expect them to be...especially when that job involves delivering mail to monsters! MONSTER MAIL is an illustrated children's book about a lively mail carrier named Juniper and her creature-filled career. Even though it�s not your average everyday job, she�s taken quite a liking to it. With exciting new discoveries (as well as a few occupational hazards), it�s important to take advice from the best! Join Juniper as she guides you through her daily deliveries in a world where monsters apparently �need mail just as much as we do. Juniper and her travel companion, Pocket! This Kickstarter is to fund the making of this book from it's current rough state to a finished product. If you're super eager to get this book in your hands ASAP, no worries! It's been written and all of the illustrations have been drawn out, so a good chunk of the work is already done. With your support, I'll be able to paint, proof, print, and ship 'em out! Below is a rendering of the finished product, as well as examples from the dummy book: Rendering (tentacle not included) Additionally, here are examples of the extra rewards that are included depending on which tier you choose: Prints available in tiers $45 and up! (Included in Monster Bundle) Stickers available in tiers $25 and up! (Included in Monster Bundle) Enamel pins available in tiers $45 and up! (Included in Monster Bundle) The cost breakdown covers all expenses involved in this project. This would include proofing and printing the books, shipping, Kickstarter fees, processing fees, printing rewards, packaging, and the ISBN barcode. This stuff sure adds up fast, but your contribution will play a huge part in what makes producing this book possible! If you are unable to support this project financially, then feel free to share my project with others and follow along with the journey via any of my social media pages HERE! Additionally, after receiving one of their really rad sample packs and searching through a few companies, I've decided I'll be going through Print Ninja to print the books! Feel free to check them out in the link below for more info on their process and products: Since the book is still in-progress, it is of utmost importance that you lovely backers are as informed as possible! Don't worry, I won't spam you all into oblivion with emails, but I do intend on keeping you as involved in my process as possible. Again, I'll be updating my social media pages with insider looks, progress photos, etc. With a little patience from ya'll (and a lot of painting on my end), everything should go according to plan! This timeline is set up in a way that prepares me for any unseen obstacles as this is, in fact, my first rodeo. There is the potential that things could get done quicker than estimated, but for safety's sake, I added an extra bit of breathing room in the schedule. If my project manages to exceed the goal I've set, I will unlock some rad bonus rewards! I'll give more insight into these goals the closer we get to 'em! My name is Angela Cronk, the illustrator and writer of Monster Mail! Most of my work includes fantastic creatures, cute characters, and silly sketches. When I'm not drawing, I'm talking with my buds, going to restaurants too much, dog-watching at parks, and yelling at the TV during any remotely tense scenes. Hangin' with the BUDS. (Haa.)

My name is Will Mason and I am the author/creator of the LGBTQ children's book series, called ""The Boy with the Rainbow Heart."" This Kickstarter is being used to launch the second book in the series, called ""The Invasion of Big Angry Red."" Want to learn more? Scroll down and learn about our journey! Front Cover! This is me signing books before speaking at the 10th anniversary of Embrace WNY's Buffalo Brunch! A couple years ago, I created a children's book, called ""The Boy with the Rainbow Heart"" in an attempt to spread more love to kids who might feel different. I was inspired to write the book because my sister had a really tough time when she came out as a kid - both at home and at school. Jessica and me last summer in LA together to speak about the book. There is a rainbow in this! I hated seeing what she went through so I decided to create the book to help spread more kindness to other children and LGBTQ families. If you want to learn more about our first book, click here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2114819346/the-boy-with-the-rainbow-heart-an-lgbtq-childrens?ref=discovery&term=the%20boy%20with%20the%20rainbow%20heart. Now, a couple years later, we are launching the second book in the series, called ""The Invasion of Big Angry Red,"" which is centered on bullying. We are dedicating this book to Jamel Myles, the 9 year old student who sadly killed himself after being bullied when he came out to his classmates this past August. It broke my heart to see that, so we got in touch with his family, and we are dedicating this book to him - as well as donating 5% of all book-sales to GLSEN - which helps spread LGBTQ acceptance in schools across the US. GLSEN is wonderful and you can actually find our first book and K-3 lesson plans on their website, listed here: https://www.glsen.org/article/boy-rainbow-heart-lesson-plans-grades-k-3.

If you're interested in making a social media post, sharing our book-launch during the month of June, please know how grateful I am. The above picture is from ""The Invasion of Big Angry Red"" which showcases The Boy defending the Town of Shine against the darkness of the bully, Big Angry Red. In this story, Big Angry Red abrupty enters the Town of Shine, and after teasing the townspeople, and causing fear everywhere - the Boy is left watching and wondering how he can help Red become less angry.

All around the world board game cafes have sprung up, from Germany to Canada to Massachusetts. When I moved to Boise a couple of years ago, I found a rich community of gamers and truly amazing Friendly Local Game Stores. Surprisingly, there wasn't a board game cafe to be found. After a trip to Portland, visiting Game Knight (if you're in Portland or will be going soon, highly recommended) sparked a desire in me that grew into what has now become Boise's first full-fledged gaming cafe, Room and Boards. After my wife and I formed an LLC last October, the specifics of the cafe began take to take shape. Once we decided on a name, finding a space became our next priority. We were fortunate to work with some outstanding local realtors (Malissa Jackson at Colliers, she's incredible I tell you) we found what would be our future home on the first place we visited. Logic told us to keep looking just to be sure, but when you know a place is right, there's really no other choice. So we started moving in around early April and preparing the space as we envisioned it. The journey of preparing to open a business has been quite an adventure, so many things that were both expected and unexpected! While there has been a slight delay of our intended opening due to permitting/plumbing issues, the calendar still looks good for us to open not longer after we expected (mid to late June now) Our plan has always been to launch a Kickstarter, and the intention of doing so is to make the community part of the cafe. We have the space, we have the games, we have all of our equipment, but what why we're doing a Kickstarter is to push us over the edge (go to 11!); we want to have a wider range of games, food, and experiences available, and this will help us get there at the start. In the meantime, you'll get access to the cafe, some great swag, and help us get to know you (and you us!) We're excited to have you game with us, because at Room and Boards, it's always game night. And it's always your place to come and play. Some of our library below! Library THE CAFE Now you know who we are, here's a bit about WHAT we are: we have a library of over 500 games, ranging from light and fun party games like Codenames, Fluxx, and Geek Out, to complex and intricate games like Twilight Imperium, Terra Mystica, and Food Chain Magnate (yes, a game about owning fast food restaurants is dauntingly complex yet utterly awesome) And we also have the staff and the knowledge to help you pick a game that will perfectly suit you and your group. For those who've not been to a board game cafe, the idea will be pretty similar to others we've had the pleasure of patronizing (Game Haus in Glendale, CA, Meepleville in Las Vegas, and Game Knight in Portland, OR are some of our favorites!) There's a $5 table fee per person, and this allows you full access to the game library to play 1 or 10 games, you're able to sit as long as you'd like to play. There's no minimum of food or drink to buy, but our menu will be available to all who sit. If there's a group who wishes to reserve the space for a special event, or host a specific game, we're always open to discuss this. We are located on Fairview Avenue in Boise (right at the edge of Meridian) in the same complex as Sockeye's Brewery. We will be open Tuesday through Thursday, 4pm - 10pm, and Friday until midnight. Saturday and Sunday we will be open 10:30am - midnight, and we are closed on Mondays. These hours may change as we get closer to our opening, and we will keep everyone informed both here and on our FB page. Our entire library will be available to browse online by the end of May with a online finder we developed for ease of use, and you are absolutely welcome to message us with any questions about any game prior to your visit. In addition to having all the modern, new games, we will also have all the classic games you loved growing up like Clue, Hungry Hungry Hippos, Jenga, and Connect Four. Every game has a place and a time, and we like to think that's where we come in! We also have a robust library of RPG sourcebooks and player guides, from classics like Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, and Call of Cthulhu to new and exciting games like Kids on Bikes, Tales from the Loop, Numenara, and more. We will start having weekly nights to teach both RPG and board games based on interest, and want to provide a place for everyone to have their game night (or day!) so all you have to do is show up. RPGs Along with the games, we have an espresso machine and a full menu of coffee-drinks, such as lattes, cappuccinos, drip coffee, and iced mochas. We will also have a beer (Sockeyes, Boise Brewery), wine (St Chapelle), and cider (Merriwether) available from local sources. We feature a full menu of panini sandwiches, small plates (cheese/meat/fruit plates), a daily soup and other snacks. REWARDS You'll find a list of all of our rewards we've got available on the campaign. From a first free visit, to a 6 month-membership, to a boardgame backpack full of awesome games, there's something for everyone, whether you're local or from out of town. If you wish to gift a pledge to someone, pledges can be given to anyone. Just let us know who and where it should go to once the pledge manager is done. The final art for the t-shirts, dice bags, mugs and glasses will be available shortly after launch, and will be included in some of our first updates. We're also very excited to be partnered with GeekOn, the manufacturer of the boardgaming backpack, and after the campaign is over, we will also be proudly featuring these in our cafe for sale! There's a little something for everyone, and if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to post in the comments or message us. STRETCH GOALS We're aiming for a modest amount, and wish to use this as a means to expand our offerings even further based on feedback we've received from our future customers. For now, we are putting 2 stretch goals, and will add more as the campaign goes along. CONCLUSION We're excited to bring the cafe to life, and even more excited to have everyone be a part of it. Throughout the campaign, we will be sharing updates and pictures of our progress, and hosting events until our opening. The first will be at Phoenix Fire Games on June 1st for International Tabletop Day, and we hope to see you all there! Game on!"

We've tried to collaborate many times since then, but this is our first official release and it's long overdue. In a day and age when marketing and promotion is more than half the battle, we have to figure out new ways to get our music heard. There has been an awesome local response, but we know we have to start taking steps towards international success. However, there's a lot of outside attention on music and art in our desert communities and plenty of local milestones still to be met. In recent years, Golden Voice has chosen a local act to be on each Coachella line up. That should be motivation for all Coachella Valley artists to push the envelope in creating fresh and unique content to catch their attention. I truly believe this amazing desert inspired - hand drawn and digitized cover art by Ivan Canevaro has the ability to do so. For this EP we are pressing a limited run of special edition 12"" vinyls with full color jackets, and hi res full color prints & stickers (cover art). All supporters will be notified after we receive test prints and details (will be available for $25 preorder). Between this merch package and the billboard, I know WillDaBeast and I will be much closer to our goals of success in good quality music with awesome art and an uplifting message. I'm eternally grateful for all your support and it will not go unnoticed. Thank you for your time.

Dollars & Donuts Productions is a small group of filmmaking friends including Daryl Della, Michael Martin, Ray Revello, and Becker Von Felsburg. the Crew We�ve been making movies together since high school and are always looking to level up in the realm of filmmaking (and red carpet posing). Michael, Ray, Daryl, & Becker at the Intendence Film Festival What's the film about? �Am I See You?� follows Whitney Nelson (Tara Erickson) on her quest to find answers about a mysterious pin left behind by her departed mother. Along with her friend Alana (Sasha Boggs), she gets mixed up with a crazy cult of collectors who will stop at nothing to acquire her special pin. The story was inspired by Daryl's lifelong obsession with Disneyland, his mother's hobby of Disney pin collecting, and an accidental 1-second clip of footage: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Daryl & Tara met up at Disneyland one day, and instead of taking a photo their friend inadvertently hit the record button. Impressed with how the accidental footage turned out, the dream to film a short inside Disneyland was born. ""Am I See You?"" is our first female-led drama. We tackle the subjects of mother-daughter relationships, friendships, and the longing for connection with loved ones who have passed on, in a mature and realistic way� that is until things go awry in the second act. It wouldn�t be a Dollars & Donuts Production without some elements of genre filmmaking. When our characters enter this bizarre new world we want the audience to be taken on a ride with them. Taking inspiration from classic Disneyland attractions and melding it with our horror/thriller roots, we think we�ve come up with the perfect cocktail of laughs, tears, and thrills. Tara, Michael, Daryl, & Sasha rehearsing at the Disneyland Hotel Directed by Daryl Della Starring Tara Erickson & Sasha Boggs Featuring Ray Revello, Becker Von Felsburg, & Michael Martin Screenplay by Daniel Viau & Daryl Della and Tara Erickson Produced by Michael Martin How do you plan to shoot the film? We�re planning on shooting the film in 4K using our trusty Panasonic GH5 cameras in V-LOG mode. Last year, we shot our first anthology feature that way and were very happy with the results. Sasha, Daryl, Michael, & Tara on location in Disneyland USA The small DSLR body also allowed us to shoot the first half of our film on location in Disneyland USA without any issues. With that completed, the rest of the film primarily takes place in the back storage room of a collectibles shop (which doubles as a meeting place for our Collector Cult). What will your contribution be supporting? With every film we make we like to take on new challenges and grow as filmmakers. This time out, one area we�d like to improve is sound recording. Always a challenge for our small crew, we hope to hire a dedicated audio recordist to capture crystal-clear sound for us. Another area we're focused on improving is set design. We want our cult to have the ultimate creep-factor and thus need an appropriate setting. The plan is to rent a studio warehouse to shoot in, and hire a set designer to create our Collectors� cave of terrors. Inspired by classic Disney, there are also a few musical moments in the film. These songs are written and composed by Robert Ruby and will be performed by our cast members. Here is a basic breakdown of the estimated budget: - Audio Recording - 10% - Set Design - 20% - Location Rental - 10% - Costumes, Props, & Misc Items - 20% - Song Creation & Recording - 20% - Daily Production Costs (transportation, food, etc.) - 10% - Kickstarter Fees and Backer Rewards - 10% On the right you'll see a list of all the great rewards you'll receive by helping us create this movie! You can also check out our website at dollarsanddonuts.com to see some of our previous work and confirm your contribution is going to a quality project. Dollars & Donuts Logo Pin Reward Thank you for your support and remember to check back often for production updates! We�ll be adding new videos and photos to this page every day to track our production progress. Let�s make a movie together! Yeah yeah yeah! Cast & Crew of ""Am I See You?"" Stretch Goals Since we have surpassed our original goal (thank you everyone who made that happen!), we have decided on some stretch goals for if we can make it to certain amounts. $15,000 If we hit $15,000, our plan is to upgrade the camera that we shoot the rest of the film on. While our Panasonic GH5s have served us very well and will remain as our B-Cams, at $15,000 we will be able to rent a higher end full-frame camera. Whether that will be a RED, a Black Magic, or a Canon C300, we're not sure yet. We've shot on variations of all those cameras before and need to do some more comparison research as to which one will be best suited to our film. $20,000 If we make it to $20,000 our plan is to screen the film in more cities nationwide. We already plan on setting up a number of these screenings, and this extra funding would make for more stops on our tour, posting video updates along the way so you can all be there with us. One place we'd love to screen the film is Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri. $25,000 If we can make it all the way to $25,000 we'd like to host a very special screening in San Francisco as a way to say thank you to everyone for their support. The plan is to rent out the Alamo Drafthouse, and not only screen the film but also hire live musicians and comedians, turning it into grand night of entertainment and celebration. Tickets would be free for Kickstarter backers."

That's 8 years. And I have now what you can call a collection of songs which makes my 8th full length studio recorded album! I've been creating a lot this last year and this year I've been blessed to be working with a post production team who is taking my music and talents to the next level! Here on Kickstarter we are funding the CD Duplication of ""The New Untitled Album"" and the final touches of making the album finalized. This album has already been mostly produced, recorded, mixed & mastered. So yes I have already put a lot of hard work and time and money into what I do! A lot of hard work!!! So now I would like to invite you to help me kick start this project into completion! Last year you all helped me a ton with the funding of my kickstarter campaign as 24 people backed my project for it to be fully funded! This year I have something a little different going on with my kickstarter campaign. This year, whoever chooses to back this project will be the only people to have this special edition exclusive copy of the album available to them! Meaning; no one else will have these special edition albums! Only people who back the project here on kickstarter! There are better rewards this year and better musical content as well! And I am going to keep the reading section much shorter this year than last year, I'd like for you to take your time looking at all of the great rewards listed this year, as they have significantly changed since last years kickstarter campaign! Another difference is that I don't have any of the artwork done for this exclusive release, so I will update all of the backers with the progress of all artwork and the finalized track listings once we are fully funded and the funds come through. THE ""WHY"" It's my desire for more people to be blessed and touched by the power of this music. And that's where you come in... As an independent artist I don't have the backing of a label, BUT I do have creative freedom to be able to use platforms such as kickstarter. And that's what I'm doing! Asking for us to collaborate together on this! I know my great supporters will Help me kick start this project! So why should you really pledge and support me? It's easy! You believe in what I do! And it's a great product! Also, I have great rewards available to you! And there will be stretch goals once enough people backs this project up and it's fully funded, all of the people who backed this project will get extra rewards based on how much extra is raised towards the stretch goals! From the new album this is one of the songs called: You Have A Voice THE ""WHO"" Jordan Copas has a passion for lighting fires through his music that will spark a thousand more. This passion was birthed through pain and hardship in his life, leading him to begin a movement called UN>LIKELY. In 1 Corinthians 1 we are told: ""God uses the weak and foolish (unlikely) people of this world to bring to shame the proud."" By the end of the chapter we see that God uses those people so that He gets all the glory! How amazing is that?!? The God of the Universe using unlikely people to bring Him glory! It doesn't matter what these people have done in their past, where they are from, or what they look like. God's grace is amazing and real, and Jordan's music brings this reality to life for others. Jordan began writing and recording music in April 2011 after God called him to take a leap of faith into the unknown world of the music industry. Since then, he has traveled the United States, touring, sharing his testimony through music, and watching as the Gospel of Jesus Christ impacts and transforms lives. Since Jordan has been performing music professionally, God has opened many doors that only He could have opened and has done many things through those opportunities that Jordan never would have thought possible. This includes witnessing to and discipling secular music artists, all of whom are now using their musical talents to glorify God! Not only that, Jordan's raw and honest music, his powerful testimony, and his unshakable faith have led countless concert-goers to have radical encounters with Christ's love. And what does Jordan say about this wild n' amazing Kingdom journey he's been on? ""God gets the glory."" https://jordancopas.com/ https://www.youtube.com/jordancopas https://www.facebook.com/JordanCopas https://www.instagram.com/jordancopasig/ https://twitter.com/jordancopas SOME REWARDS: Signed Tour Banner (Reward Option) 1 available!

The movie transcripts My name is Tamar Rothstein I am a spiritual teacher, I am happy to present the book back to the truth. The first of three books I'm about to publish For many years I suffered from anxiety and attention deficit problems, even though I had everything I wanted, a supportive loving partner, I was not happy. I saw that my anxieties permeated and affected my partner, Shimon, really only when he reached the edge, losing his temper and shouting I listen to him One day, in the midst of a bout of self-hatred, I heard a deep voice coming from my soul and asking me why you were getting worse with yourself. I saw there was an aggressive voice in my head that I believed. I asked God not to learn more from suffering. I wanted to learn from love. Life presents difficulties for us to wake up. The challenges are not the problem these are our judicial thoughts about them. The book Back to Truth will give you the tools to develop attentiveness and contact with your inner world. How to be present in the present in the challenge, to be connected and not reactive.

This Kickstarter is for two different projects that work great together but also are completely independent RPG accessories that can be used individually. Different pledge levels will let you get either just one type or get both of them bundled together. Minimalist Creature Dice are 1 inch cubes that can be used instead of miniatures for table top role playing games and the Status & Condition Markers are a great simple way to track the status and condition of different creatures and players. Minimalist Creature Dice When I decided to run a game to introduce D&D to my niece and nephew I realized that I was either going to have to buy $30-$50 worth of my own miniatures or drive over an hour both ways to borrow my brother's collection and then have them back before his next session with his play group. The other solution was to just use what I had around, random lego men, plastic army figures etc. but that always bothered me when a player would say something like, ""I attack R2D2"" and I have to say, oh so you're attacking the ""Lich Lord""? Random figures just take the players out of the game. These Minimalist Creature Dice are the perfect solution. One of these dice can replace 6 standard miniatures. A set of 6 of these dice is the equivalent of having 36 different miniatures at your disposal. 6 Creature Dice = 36 Standard Miniatures They are clearly marked with the name of the creature and minimalist artwork that make them easy to discern at a glance. The creatures represented are GOBLIN, ORC, UNDEAD, KOBOLD, HUMAN & ELF. These were chosen among other reasons because they are creatures that are commonly encountered in a lot of games and often the most likely creatures for early level adventurers to come up against when starting a campaign. Once the funding goal is reached they will be available in three different colors green, red & black with further colors being unlocked at different stretch goals (see below[blue unlocked]). You can get the dice all in one color or a variety of your choice of all unlocked colors. The idea of having multiple colors is to make it easy to tell which creature is which and to differentiate between different types of the same creature (melee, ranged, magic, npc, big boss, etc). Status & Condition Markers One of the biggest challenges when you're playing an encounter in a table top roll playing game with a lot going on is keeping track of everything. Both as a player and as a Game Master it is easy to forget a small detail that may be important such as a particular status or condition you or another creature or player is currently in. I did a lot of searching for a good solution to this but I could never find one. I've seen people use coins, aquarium pebbles and different colored markers but these aren't great solutions because it's easy to forget what color means what and not every player at the table ever really knows what all of the different markers mean. That is why I created my Status & Condition Makers which make it easy for everyone to tell exactly what is going on at a glance. Currently there are two different versions of these markers. Each marker has four different status/conditions on it. The first version is the Universal Status & Condition Marker, it has PRONE, RESTRAINED, STUNNED & BLINDED. These four status/conditions are used in both 4E & 5E Dungeons and Dragons as well as many other RPGs. The second version is the 5E Status & Condition Marker, it has POISONED, CHARMED, GRAPPLED & FRIGHTENED. These four status/conditions are used in other RPGs but specifically I was concentrating on the most recent edition of Dungeons & Dragons. I also have the design done for a 4E Status & Condition Maker that is unlockable [UNLOCKED!] as a Stretch Goal (see below). If this project does well I will also take suggestions for further versions of these markers for D&D and other games. Stretch Goals $7500 = NEW COLOR for Creature Dice [BLUE UNLOCKED!] If the project reaches $7500 we will add one more color for the creature dice. This color will be chosen by the backers. Shortly after hitting $7500 I will send out a survey to everyone who is backing the project to chose what color we will be adding. $10,000 to unlock = 4E Status & Condition Markers [UNLOCKED!] If the project reaches $10,000 we will create a new version of the Status & Condition dice, this version will feature status/conditions that are frequent in the fourth edition of Dungeons and Dragons most likely MARKED, CURSED, DAZED & ONGOING. $12,000 to unlock = NEW COLOR for Creature Dice [PURPLE UNLOCKED!] If the project reaches $12,000 we will add one more color for the creature dice. This color will be chosen by the backers. Shortly after hitting $12,000 I will send out a survey to everyone who is backing the project to chose what color we will be adding. Bonus Goal = NEW COLOR for Creature Dice [YELLOW UNLOCKED!]"

We�ve got our eyes set on the perfect building for the job, and we�re hoping to earn the funds to buy it outright. We hope to use the Kickstarter cash to completely pay off the building�s mortgage, so that we can invest more time, funds, and love into setting up the shop. Our team has always had a love for literature, and wish to spread that love around our community. Books hold thousands of different universes, morals, and characters that continually inspire and push us forward, and Serendipi*TEA Books strives to be a center for the wonderful tales that people can tell. Tea has also been a favorite of our collaboraters, with all the fancy table clothes, teapots, and frilly hats that a traditional tea room lets you experience. But we realize that people today are always on their feet- in between work, social life, and chores- so we want to provide people a chance to enjoy the refined taste of tea without the time invested into a boisterous get-together. If the Kickstarter�s goal is reached, we will buy the building and input more time into renovating, decorating, and equipping it. The backer�s money is going straight into paying off the mortgage and funding rewards.

3435197,1,3.495821753385906,3.361727836017593,161,30.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2019,560448480/deathroll,1558202788,Conor Patrick Kennedy,0,1,0,"DEATHROLL is a science-fantasy RPG that invites its players to try-out new ways to play, new ways to write, and new roles to take on. This is because every story told in the apocalyptic world of Arcadia is finite. Meaning, every setting, every character -- even the GM -- are all meant to be experienced just a single time. Illustrated by F-G-P DEATHROLL is a game that empowers its players to take on the role of the GM. It is my belief that most players who never try playing as the GM aren't disinterested in the role, but overwhelmed by it. DEATHROLL aims to change this. Games can be short �one-offs� (referred to as Tales) that can be ready to play in as short as an hour. A small list of 3 primary, PbtA inspired ""moves"", make running the game incredibly streamlined. Settings (referred to as Adventures or Tales) are created using a step-by-step process called Adventure Creation. Each segment (or Act) of an Adventure is created one at a time, allowing the GM to focus on a smaller portion of the larger story without having to consider the entire arc. Instead of just creating a ruleset of how to play, DEATHROLL also creates a ruleset of how to write. If you have never attempted to run an RPG, learning from a guide can be a daunting feat. Though running a game is complex, it has been meticulously unpacked and demystified to great extents in other games. However, the problem as I see it does not lie in the running of a game, but the writing of the setting. Attempting to both properly design and creatively write a setting for the players to enjoy keeps many from ever touching the role of GM. This is where a process called Adventure Creation comes in. For both GMs who are completely new to the role, as well as those that have been running games for decades; Adventure Creation supplies a new way to think about the very first and most important part of being the GM � designing the setting. Illustrated by F-G-P During Adventure Creation a GM will create: Acts: Individual segments of an Adventure (based on the three-act narrative structure). Major Conflicts: Each Act's individual conflict that must be resolved before players can progress. Villains: The antagonists responsible for an Act's Major Conflict. Encounters: Challenges that involve a specific person(s), obstacle, or event. Grand Scheme: The primary conflict of the entire Adventure and the cause of all the other Major Conflicts. Archvillain: The dastardly mastermind behind the Grand Scheme and the main villain of the setting. Entire Adventures like this are created in segments, only adding additional Acts after prior ones have been completed. This allows the GM to: Focus on the creation of the individual Acts without having to worry about the overall arc of the entire story. Begin new games and create original settings much faster. Develop the next major portion of the story based on the player's choices they made during the prior Act. Through Encounter Creation, the setting you have written will become both playable and challenging. Designing a setting to both be a fun challenge while remaining fair to the players can be difficult, even for veteran GMs. Encounter Creation simplifies this design process by: Centering each Encounter a GM adds around a single Focus: either a specific person(s), obstacle, or event. Asking the GM to determine the types of Threats their Encounters will contain: NPCs, Puzzles, Creatures, Weather, and more. Having the GM establish the Encounter's Difficulty Rating, narrowing down what is key to the Encounter and why. The player characters that you will be controlling are referred to as Survivors, poor souls who have lived through an apocalyptic event known as The Great Downfall. Times are tough now sure, but as the players will discover from creating these Survivors, Arcadia has not been a kind place for some time now. Illustrated by F-G-P Survivors are created rapidly, with familiarity of the creation process allowing the player to create a new character in under 20 minutes. This is made possible due to every Survivor�s background being fleshed out as they are being generated. Assembled through Life Events the player rolls, the Survivor will develop all the way from adolescence to the time of The Great Downfall itself. Survivors in DEATHROLL are class-based, using PbtA inspired class-specific �moves� (referred to as Talents), each of which are linked to one of 46 different Skills. Unlike traditional PbtA systems, each Talent in DEATHROLL can be acquired by any other class, so long as that Survivor has Mastery over the Skill the Talent is linked to. Skills, used in conjunction with Abilities (like in D6 systems) are also class-based, but also accessible by any other class, either by experiencing a particular Life Event during Survivor Creation, or through Skill Progression (our equivalent of leveling). Survivors are also constructed with: Races: Either Human or Azani, race dictates initial benefits and disadvantages, as well as a unique benefit that passively assists the Survivor. Wealth Statuses: Your Survivor�s social class and access to wealth prior to The Great Downfall. Higher Wealth Statuses offer better Gear Packages (an initial reward of useful items) before play begins. Motivators: A strong drive that compels the Survivor to act, often times irrationally. DEATHROLL uses a mishmash of D6 and PbtA systems you may be familiar with, but with an added layer of flexibility. In most cases, both the GM and the player engage with the same system, not two separate ones created specifically for each role. This allows for a much clearer view into what everyone at the table is capable of, allowing for more clarity on how the rules are meant to be used by everyone (including the GM). Action Resolution by Contest: All Actions are resolved through a Contest between two players (a Survivor and the GM). The winner of the Contest resolves the Action to their liking. Contextual Damage: Context-based damage output. If it seems possible to kill with Lethal Damage, simply win a Contest to do so and take out the target with a single strike. Universal Actions: Both the Survivors and the GM take Actions. Meaning, some of the GM�s Actions are contestable by the players, and can be forced to fail if the GM loses a Contest with a player opposing them. Exertion Cards: Used as a hand of playing cards, an additional Pool Modifier of dice can be added to both the GMs or player�s Dice Pools. Cards are played face-down, then revealed at the same time, adding their value in dice as a surprise to the other. Illustrated by F-G-P Gear Packages: Quickly jump into a new game with a full set of useful items without having to crunch numbers deciding what you can and cannot afford to buy. Trust Statuses: A trackable scale of Trust makes it quick and easy to determine how NPCs interact with Survivors or how close they are to becoming friend or foe. Narrative Initiative: An initiative system that can be used at any time by the GM to create turn-based play during which only a certain amount of Actions can be taken (including GM Actions). Threat Guides: Walkthroughs that help the GM create any possible Threat she can imagine: Creatures, Terrain, Weather, Traps, and more. Written & designed by Conor Kennedy Edited by Barbey Plummer Art by Fausto Pontes Character Sheet by Meg Ellison The book is both fully written and edited, with only the layout and art (both of which that are well underway) remaining to be finished. The PDF will be optimized in RGB for screens, with the expected internal linking and bookmarks. The fully edited (but not laid out) draft can be found here. How to get the Book As you pledge to this Kickstarter, you get the PDF copy of the game as well as the ""at-cost"" POD (print-on-demand) from DriveThru RPG. This means that you will need to pay DriveThru RPG in order to receive a physical copy of the book (if you desire one). In this way, every backer will have the option to buy the printed copy of the game on DriveThru RPG�s marketplace (est. $10 + shipping) in addition to also receiving the PDF version. We make no additional money off the sale of printed copies, this is why the POD is priced �at cost�. The $10 pledge a backer makes is all the revenue I earn. Drive Thru RPG simply needs to cover the cost of printing. If you don�t wish to have a physical copy, or don�t like the idea of spending more than $10 to play the game, simply ignore the POD or give it away to someone else."

News 12- Doug Geed & Danielle Campbell We have partnered with Golden Paw Society, a cat rescue based out of Huntington, NY. The mission of Golden Paw Society is to rescue cats from high kill shelters, which we think is just amazing! At The Shabby Tabby Cat Cafe, people are able to meet and socialize with the cats and get to know their true personalities. It is easier to see how the cats really are when they are in the comfort of the cafe than meeting them in a shelter setting where they are often scared. 13 Year Old Bugs Bunny- ADOPTED 4 Year Old Casey- ADOPTED Princess & Coco- BOTH ADOPTED We provide a one hour experience to come in and hang out with our resident cats, who are all adoptable. If you fall in love, you can apply to take them home! Every cat is fully vaccinated and given a clean bill of health before entering the cafe, and our application process is thorough. We want to make sure the home is a purrfect fit for both you and the kitty! Throughout the past year, our Shabby Tabby team has been so successful in reaching our goals, that we have decided to open another location in Huntington Village. By doing this, we will be able to increase the amount of cats we take in, which is MANY, many more cats that can be rescued from euthanasia! The Shabby Tabby Cat Cafe will also be able to continue to bring animal lovers together through our events. We have events like Drag Queen Bingo, Kitten Yoga, TNR classes, private parties, Paint Nights, and other fun various events. These events bring the cat rescue community together while creating more social cats who love the company of humans. We have chosen Huntington Village because it is a vivacious town with plenty to do! We wanted to find a location in which our cats would get the most exposure by having lots of things to do, while also being in the same town as our partner rescue- Golden Paw Society! We have found and secured a location in the heart of the village and we have begun renovations and catifications! We will be partnering up with local bakeries and eateries who will provide our snacks and food for events. We will not be preparing any food in house. Only beverages like coffee, different teas, hot chocolate, and more, which will all be included complimentary in the 1 hour session price. Rewards:"

The Legend's Cookbook is a culinary adventure between two covers. This is a professionally developed and designed cookbook filled to the brim with good food, charming illustrations and imaginative recipes. This cookbook is for everyone, beginners and pros. Drawing from a litany of inspirations, we capture a sense of adventure, novelty and the wild. These dishes will transport the reader to new worlds, teaching them to cook with a plethora of different techniques, approaches and flavors. From the culinary styles of the French, Spanish, German, and even something out of this world, this cookbook will be your guide to fantastic dining everyday. It will act as a gateway to a diverse dining table and truly take your breath away. This is an original, independent, and unofficial project led and being created by fans of cooking, gaming and making things. You can follow along with the project on our Twitter @LegendsCookbook or our Instagram @legends_cookbook. My name is Peter J. Abreu, I�m chef, pilot and traveler. Originally, I�m from Long Island, NY, but I can�t say I�m from just there. My mother's Italian, and my father's Cuban, so I learned almost everything I know about good food from watching my family cook dinner. Everything else I learned about food came from my time abroad. My parents worked in the airline industry as I was growing up, so I was fortunate enough to be able to embrace my heritage and experience others all across the globe. I spent the summers of high school teaching and cooking in the Castilian region of Spain, and that�s where I realized my dream to help spread what I�d learned all across the globe. I attended flight school, became a pilot, and started my own YouTube cooking show where I embrace my love for cooking, video games and traveling. Speaking of, I�ve met a lot of incredible people on my travels, shared so many memorable meals and learned a lot about what to do in the kitchen. What I love about a good meal is that it brings people together and takes them on a journey. I want to bring that to as many people as possible, and this cookbook will be your invitation to this journey. I�m not alone in this project either; I�m joined with an incredible team of creative professionals and now we want you to be our cooking champion. The Legend�s Cookbook will be produced in digital, paperback and hardcover formats so you can choose-your-own-adventure. Contained in this 8"" x 10"" cookbook's 150 pages, you'll find over 70 original recipes, hundreds of hand-drawn illustrations and diagrams, plus professional food photography that will inspire you to try every single dish. Not only are there straight-forward directions in this cookbook, but I�m going to be sharing interesting tips and info I�ve learned over the years about everything culinary. Ever wonder why saffron is so expensive? What�s the difference between the different types olive oil? Why do we put salt on everything? Get equipped with all sorts of cooking hints. You�ll be impressed with a lot of the aesthetic attributes as well, such as the delightful field guide style of the cookbook, complete with anatomical sketches of herbs, charcoal sketches and small watercolor pieces tucked away in the corners of pages. It�s fun, adventurous, and stands out, not just in the kitchen but on your bookshelf. Design not final, subject to change. So far, we�ve already composed and tasted every single one of the 70+ recipes being included in this cookbook. I�ve spent a lot of time showing them off and tweaking them on my YouTube cooking channel. We�ve taken these recipes far, even getting some feedback from my grandma (and she�s the best cook I know). The next step is to put them out there into the world. We�ve spent the last year prepping for that. My team and I have spent that time working on photographing the food for the cookbook, designing the layouts and working on all the art we will need to fill the pages. As a result, we are nearly done with an initial print draft of the book. This is where we need your help in the final leg of our publishing journey. As you can see from all the incredible photos and sample pages here, our team has personally invested a lot time and money in this project but we need your support and backing to physically print this cookbook. We've done all the legwork, gotten price quotes and have lined up a fantastic printer, we just need to know how many to order. If you can�t back this project right now, you can help us by simply sharing our project on social media or telling a friend. This is a group effort. As with any incredible undertaking, so many people have been there for us all along and now we just need you. Join us and we can finish this quest so we can start a new one in kitchens all across the globe. Within this cookbook, we are aiming for the highest caliber of flavor while adhering to the themes of nature, simplicity and the wild. To achieve this, we engineered our recipes with a few specifics. Things like not using artificial food dye. Natural coloring should be utilized as often as possible, even if this involves extracting pigments from certain ingredients just to add to later dishes. Blackberry pur�e will always beat out purple food coloring - we want to arm you with the wisdom of the natural alternatives. We also want to utilize fresh ingredients as natural and raw as possible. Don�t get us wrong, we don�t want you to go through the hassle of threshing your own wheat when you can just buy a pound of flour from a store, but if you want something special and a bit wilder, we are going to make you aware of it and more power to you for trying it. Our last tenant is one of simplicity. All of our recipes are straightforward to make. There�s nothing wrong with a baked apple recipe being just baking an apple with some brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon. A simple meal is often the best meal and we want you to have the courage to try it. I've been cooking all my life and sharing those recipes with my friends, and audience on YouTube. I've even gained over 25,000 subscribers and have millions of views. I�m also collaborating with the lead writer and several other team members of the recently released Mother�s Cookbook. You can check out their previous campaign here to get a taste of what we�re hoping to make in this cookbook. We have an incredible team of photographers, writers, chefs and artists. Peter J.

My name is Kiana and I�ve been passionate about Pok�mon since I was a little girl! I recently saw the Detective Pikachu movie and was completely in love with all of the Pok�mon showcased throughout the film! So I thought I�d create some pin designs inspired by some of the Pok�mon featured in the film. I�ve been making Pins for almost 2 years now and have successfully funded a previous Kickstarter! So I thought why not try another? :) Here are the details about the pins and their funding tiers: Initial Goal Pikachu is the star of the show so he�s the initial goal of the Kickstarter and will unlock at $500. He will be 1.25� in length and will be Hard Enamel with rose gold plating. I priced him so high due to other costs I have to factor in once the Kickstarter is funded. That entails pin production, shipping costs, and Kickstarter funds. (They take about 15% of the final funded amount.) Once Pikachu is funded, well move on to unlocking stretch goals! I posted these on my Instagram so I�m basing the order in which these are to be unlocked on popularity. Snorlax will also be 1.25� in length as well as hard enamel with rose gold plating. :) Up next is Psyduck who will also be 1.25� in length as well as Hard Enamel with rose gold plating. Then we have sassy Mewtwo will be the same at 1.25� hard Enamel with rose gold plating. Last but not least is Ditto, who will also be 1.25� in length with Hard enamel and rose gold plating. :)"

Grill Rescue uses steam to clean your grill. Not aggravated forceful brushing. THE PROBLEM: You know the pains of cleaning your grill. So well, that you tell yourself you like the ""flavor"" it gives when you don't. You know the frustration of attempting to clean your grill with a dirty, rusted, metal bristle grill brush. Is that really the best we can do? I don't think needing a tetanus shot after grilling is satisfactory. Or even good enough.. WARNING - SHOCKING FACT: In a 12 year span, there were an estimated 1,698 grill brush injuries in the United States alone. That's over 130 injuries per year in a single country. Are you next to eat your wire bristles? X-rays of wire bristles getting lodged in people. So, ask yourself: Is my grill brush really worth it? We know you settled for your current grill cleaner. That's Okay. You can say goodbye to eating wire bristles, wood shavings, and stone powder. Do any of these look familiar? Point to the one you have. Now get your filthy fingers off your screen. We have solved all the problems with these grill cleaners and made the grill brush of your dreams. Seriously, this thing rocks. The biggest issue with current grill brushes are that they simply don't work. On top of that, you have to deal with a number of additional problems. They break easily and get stuck in your food. They are not sanitary. They are always dirty (how do you clean your grill with a dirty cleaner?). They leave a nasty residue on your grill or just move the mess around. Why do you deal with this? Because there's no other option! THE SOLUTION: Grill Rescue uses steam to clean your grill. Yes, to actually clean your grill. Using Grill Rescue is so simple to use and will save you loads of time you could spend eating your food. Step 1. Preheat your grill to a minimum of 400 degrees Fahrenheit. For safety, turn off the burners once your grill is hot. Step 2. Dunk your brush, or run it under water. Step 3. Gently wipe away the nasty gunk that's been building up. Grill Rescue gets in all the grooves for a super clean grill. We've designed our brush heads to fit in all grill grates. You might be asking yourself, wouldn't this brush get super dirty after cleaning a really nasty grill? YES! Grill Rescue has to get dirty to get your grill clean. Most grill cleaners just stay dirty. Not Grill Rescue! We've thought of that too. Put your detachable brush head in your dishwasher or washing machine. Now it's clean and ready to clean more BBQ rib gunk. It was made to be reused for up to 100 washes (on average during testing). After that, just grab your 2nd brush head, snap it on your Grill Rescue, and you're good for another 100 cleans! THE PROCESS: Designing the world's best grill brush was very difficult. Wanting something better than what's currently on the market is easy, creating it is hard. It took nearly 2 years to design and create the perfect version of Grill Rescue.Take a look below and get a 30 second view of the last 2 years creating the perfect grill brush. 1st Prototype - Made from the handle of an existing grill brush, wood block, and terrycloth. 2nd Prototype - Made from the handle of an existing grill brush with disconnecting mechanism, mildly absorbent sponge, and high quality terrycloth. 3rd Prototype - Made from a custom designed 3D printed handle, very absorbent heat proof ""sponge"", and high quality terrycloth. 6th Prototype - Branded with the Grill Rescue logo. Made from a fire retardant custom designed 3D printed handle, very absorbent heat proof foam, wrapped in a high quality heat proof cloth. We created Grill Rescue out of frustration of a dirty grill. No grill cleaner could clean our grills well enough. We soon found there was an even bigger issue. People are swallowing metal bristles that break off the most popular grill cleaners. Thousands of people are being sent to the Emergency Room in excruciating pain and getting immediate surgery to remove these metal pieces from throats, stomachs, and even hearts. This is when we knew we could make a real difference. Hundreds of news videos and thousands of articles and Facebook posts flood the web of people getting severely injured from grill brushes. We are going to put a stop to this for good and get your grill cleaned in the process. Grill Rescue is not only a life saver, it truly is the world's best grill brush!

The cover may be the most frightening image Ditko has ever produced so we only dare show you a portion in our preview. This issue is another 48-page anthology. The selection of materials is the equal of our two previous issues, perhaps even a little better? Now there are some, many, who would like to know the details of plot, character, theme, and the conclusion of any coming attraction anywhere. Those so interested can tune in to Turner Classic Movies in the evening and listen to the host reveal all of this and more before he begins showing the picture. The Channel Guide provides details of the plot and ending of movies and television programs. Select a tv news channel and you can find someone who will anxiously tell you how the big game will turn out, the contents of the political speech scheduled for the following day or how the election will be decided. Turn to a comic book web site for all of the details about the new comics from Archie, DC, Marvel and others. We have chosen to go our own way. We can�t compete with Archie and the others and would be lost in the mix if we tried to do so. Snyder and Ditko have established some sort of a record from 1988 to date. We have produced 62 different books--from Steve Ditko�s Static in the beginning to Konga no. 25 last year and Postshadowing vol. iv this month. Now comes Out of This World this Summer. Our book is complete, finished, but for the editorial pages. This is where you can shine, where we can add your name to the growing number of subscribers to our publications. Yes, all we have to do is complete work on the text pages and send the book to the printer. We have been working with Morgan Printing for many years and are pleased with their work, efficiency and quick turn-around. We invite you to join us in our new campaign. We can use your help. We do not have the star attractions of Archie, DC, Marvel and the others. Perhaps you can help us to spread the word about this new production. Once we succeed in our campaign we will review the pages one more time before turning the book over to the printer. Thank you,"

History and Inspiration Hak4Kidz has been around for six years providing kids ages 7 - 17 a fun and safe ethical hacking conferences, much like you enjoy. In 2016, we produced our first digital badge (with lots of help) and the kids loved it! This badge got us invited into the #badgelife DEF CON community. In 2017, we produced the analog cipher-disc badge you may have seen during hacker summer camp. In 2018, we produced another analog badge using a deck of trading cards called Phreaker Life! Tons of puzzles in the cards which 1 person solved for a lifetime badge to CypherCon!! This year, in partnership with MK Factor (the GOON Box badge creators) we present to you our 2019 badge! Tinker, our mascot, is sitting behind a giant cryptex. The cryptex is from the movie The Da Vinci Code which is used to store a secret message. Figure out how to unlock the cryptex and it's secrets are yours! Features and Hardware Additional resources available on Github Three different types of badges are used at Hak4Kidz events, Tyro, Admin, and 1337. The Tyro badge is white for kids and parents, the Admin badge is red for volunteers, and the 1337 is black for event organizers and founders. Using PCB materials that match the badges colors we use was super cool. We wanted the badge to have connectivity options, but didn't want them as separate components on the board. The badge needed to be easy for kids to code on, something familiar and lots of examples like the Arduino IDE, so using the ESP32 made sense. Keeping our primary audience in mind, as much simplicity and fun as possible was a requirement. So, having a lot of blinky lights, micro-USB for flashing, easy soldering add-ons, big LCD, and way cool touch pads were must haves! When the kids pressed the touch pads there would be some response, and 1 challenge for CTF points, but the other badges had those touch options mixed up. For example, on the 1337 badge pressing touch pad 6 revealed the challenge, but not on the other 2 badges. Let's take a look at the components.

Pricing is exclusive to this campaign and offers backers a 15% discount on regular pricing. Plus, we�re covering the shipping. Our campaign goal is to raise funds to invest in manufacturing and packaging to make our processes more efficient so we can make more ladders more quickly. We�ve sold hundreds of ladders and our customers and their cats love them. Now we need to step up production capabilities to keep up with orders. It�s a good challenge to have! Baltic Birch is a strong, attractive and dimensionally stable wood product that�s been used by European cabinet and furniture makers for decades. It allows us to efficiently produce ladder parts with precision and speed. Thanks to birch�s hard, uniform grain, we can use finishes that dry quickly and evenly. Cat Ladder style is simple and tasteful, to complement any d�cor. It�s not the typical cat climber from the pet store that you wish you could stash away. Cat Ladder is thoughtfully designed to be sturdy, safe and remain stable where you put it, and we've made sure it�s angled and stepped just right for easy climbing. The durable carpet pads let cats grip as they climb, and scratch as they�re naturally inclined to do. Our ladders are crafted like quality furniture and built to last. We sweat the details and take care with the finishing touches including the custom packaging to make sure your Cat Ladder arrives in perfect shape. Cat Ladder is light enough so you can move it from place to place in your home to give your curious cat a fresh view and access to new places to explore. And that will help keep your kitty active and happy! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

College friends turned business partners 25 years later, Damon Knopf and Joe Koziol were determined to combine their skills and ideas to create something truly unique. In 2014 they formed Kozworks LLC. Cat Ladder is the first product they�ve brought to market, and it has evolved into a full product line with multiple sizes, finishes, carpet choices and more. Enhancements and complementary product ideas are in the hopper, ready to be developed. Damon brings years of experience in fine woodworking to Kozworks. He handcrafts and ships the ladders from the manufacturing shop in Durham, North Carolina. Joe�s background in architectural metalwork and furniture design (as well as his love of cats!) led to the creation of the first Cat Ladder.

We're pumped to announce we've reached three of our stretch goals, we're now offering White glow as a color option, Ebony Wood as a wood option, the Voltage Pendant, a pendant featuring the same fractal design as the Voltage Ring, and a Free UV Light Keychain with every order! - Check them out at the bottom of the page! Meet the Voltage Ring. Inspired by natural bioluminescence, we set out to create a ring that embodied the raw and unbridled energy found in nature. We ended with a ring that captures the excitement of a truly brilliant bolt of lightning. Each voltage ring features a Wooden Band with Fractal Burns that Glow at night thanks to our own proprietary formula. Featured on BackerCity and BackerClub! Each and every Voltage Ring is handmade in America through a collaborative effort between our three companies: Carbon Fi, Carbon 6, and Patrick Adair Designs. Making this (as far as we know) the largest collaboration Kickstarter�s ever seen. The foundation of each Voltage Ring is a luxury wooden band, handcrafted out of your choice of maple, cherry, or walnut. Each band is complimented by a luminescent glow liner. The liners are made using the same material and process as luxury Swiss watches and charged using UV rays that can be found in black lights or natural sunlight. We are also offering the opportunity to replace the luminescent liner with a luxury grade forged carbon fiber or aerospace grade titanium liner! What truly sets the Voltage Ring apart is the fractal burned into each ring. Taking inspiration from lightning, the fractals are created by transmitting over 10,000 volts through the wood using high voltage iron probes. Electricity travels from one probe throughout the wood and back into a second probe. This unique process is what creates the incredible lightning bolt pattern seen on the outside of each ring. Each fractal is completely random meaning that no two rings will ever be identical. While fractal burning is not uncommon in larger art pieces, we are the only team currently able to apply it to jewelry, but the complexity of the Voltage Ring doesn't stop there. Once the fractals are created, they are hand filled with pure strontium aluminate glow crystals. The micro-glow crystals intake energy through uv light or heat energy and slowly emit it back out overtime as visible light. The color of the light that is emitted is dictated by the internal crystal structure which outputs a visible wavelength in the ROYGBV light spectrum The pattern that is left is known as a Lichtenberg figure and it beautifully displays the path electricity takes when flowing through a material. This complex process makes each Voltage Ring completely unique and one of a kind. The Voltage Ring was born from our goal to create a piece of jewelry that could capture the raw beauty seen in arcing electricity. Lightning is represented wonderfully in larger art pieces through the fractal burning process. Our goal was to use our combined expertise in the Jewelry industry to perfect this process and apply it to smaller pieces at scale. We took careful consideration in our design: every choice of material, color, and finish is deliberate and intentional. We love the symbolism of the rings being burned but then rebuilt to be better and brighter than ever before THE TEAM This project required the necessary experience of all three of our companies: Carbon 6's specialty in precision CNC machining allows for the two piece bands to be manufactured quickly and precisely. They�re also the only company able to produce fractal burns precise enough to be added to rings at scale. These rings wouldn't be half as amazing if they didn't have a brilliant glow solution. The Voltage Rings feature a luminescent glow liner on the inside and a glow resin inlay on the outside of the ring. Carbon Fi makes all of this possible by bringing in a proprietary resin solution that has been formulated to have the maximum glow brightness and duration. He calls it: SuperLume. The final design challenge that we faced was the inlaying and finishing process. Due to the unique nature of each ring, they need to be hand inlaid with strontium aluminate and hand finished. This is where Patrick Adair Designs shines. Featuring over a dozen seasoned artisans, they specialize in creating handmade rings making them the perfect team to hand finish each Voltage Ring. Each Voltage Ring is Born in Brooklyn, New York: The wooden stock is processed and machined into bands The titanium, carbon fiber, and lume liners are machined and inserted into the wooden band High voltage is used to burn fractals into the wood The rings then are packed and leave Brooklyn And Finished in Salt Lake City, Utah: The rings are vacuum infused with a clear resin to make them waterproof The fractals are packed with strontium aluminate glow crystals and infused with a resin (sourced from Carbon Fi in Phoenix, Arizona) Each voltage ring is carefully hand sanded then given a glossy finish The ring is packaged and shipped to the customer A finished Voltage Ring What Materials Make a Voltage Ring? Wooden Band: There are three varieties of wood available: Cherry, Walnut, and Maple. The Cherry option features a beautiful reddish-brown hue. Walnut is darker with a rich earthy tone. Our Maple wood bands feature a lighter color with an elegant, smooth grain pattern. Inserts: Titanium Insert: At 3X the strength of steel, Titanium is an excellent and straightforward choice. Featuring a polished metallic finish, it gives a traditional and professional look to your ring. We use aerospace grade titanium which is incredibly lightweight making it a perfect choice to accent the wooden band. Forged Carbon Fiber Insert: Forged Carbon Fiber is a luxury material that is commonly reserved for Super Cars (like the Lamborghini Hurracan). Hand forged in Brooklyn, New York, it features a beautiful marbled pattern that can't be found in normal Carbon Fiber. Our Forged Carbon Fiber is silky smooth and incredibly lightweight meaning most of the time you will forget it's even on your finger. Luminescent Resin Insert: Our proprietary SuperLume resin is made using the same high quality, long-lasting, and non-toxic materials found in luxury Swiss watches. It is rated to have intense glow for 10+ years. The glow is powered by UV radiation that can be found in natural sunlight or the light bulbs around your house. If you are looking to rapidly charge your voltage ring, we highly recommend you use a black light!"

You might know me as the guy who said ""No"" to The Voice... TWICE! The $1000 objective has been reached! Continue to pledge and we could make a nice music video with the release of the EP! I decided I was gonna start my career as an independent. Now more than ever, you have singer songwriters that manage their career on their own and make a decent living out of it. The reason for that is that record companies don't invest in young artists as much as they used to and social media has made promotion affordable to anyone. Back in 2013 I got a message from one of the casting managers for The Voice, and he said: ""I like what you do, come and audition"". The thing they don't tell you when you watch the show is that there's a contract. So this is what happens, they make you sign a contract that is gonna rule the next 15 years of your career before you do the show. Because you are small and will give up anything to become a star. It's an 80 pages long contract with ridiculous details like on how much they are gonna take from you when you sell T-shirts in 10 years. And what is even more absurd is that they only talk about business never about art. You don't know with whom you're gonna work. You don't know if they are gonna understand what you are trying to create. If for some reason it doesn't work out with them you're done. In the music industry you don't get a second chance. I want to keep it real. I want my art to be true. Yes I do want to make some money like everyone else, but that is not the reason why I wake up everyday. In a way I have to thank them. Cause not signing with them, that's what got me out there. Disappointed I decided to take my amp and my guitar and do my own The Voice in the streets. See if people stop, if they turn around... I just finished recording 3 songs and now I'd like to have them mixed by a professional to get the best sound out of them. I found an awesome independent sound engineer in Los Angeles to mix them. If you wanna support me on this: With a $1000 I'll be able to print some CDs and sell them on the road. With $2000 I'll be able to make a nice music video. With $3000 I can invest in PR and make great goodies (T-shirts or caps...) Salut moi c'est DJINN ! Vous me connaissez peut-�tre comme celui qui a dit ""Non"" � The Voice... Deux fois ! J'ai d�cid� de lancer ma carri�re en ind�pendant. Maintenant plus que jamais les auteurs compositeurs interpr�tes g�rent leurs carri�res seuls. Cela s'explique par le fait que les maisons de disques n'investissent plus dans les jeunes talents autant qu'avant et que les r�seaux sociaux ont rendu la promotion accessible au plus grand nombre. En 2013, j'ai re�u un message d'un des casting managers pour The Voice, et il m'a dit: ""J'aime bien ce que tu fais, viens auditionner"". J'�tais curieux, je me suis dit pourquoi pas? Je l'ai fait, tout s'est bien pass� mais je ne me sentais pas pr�t. Alors,j'ai dit non... 2 ans plus tard, en 2015 j'avais travaill� comme un fou, ma technique vocale �tait en place, je pensais avoir fait le plus dur, mais ce qui arriva ensuite fut un vrai choc!!! Ce qu'ils ne vous disent pas quand vous regardez l'�mission, c'est qu'il y a un contrat. Je ne parle pas d'un contrat d'image ou de t�l�vision, mais d'un contrat de disque. Voil� comment �a se passe...Ils vous font signer un contrat qui va g�rer les 15 prochaines ann�es de votre carri�re avant m�me de faire l'�mission! Parce que vous �tes petit et faible et pr�t � tout c�der pour devenir une Super Star. C'est un contrat de 80 pages avec des d�tails ridicules comme: Quel pourcentage ils vont prendre sur vos ventes de T-shirts, votre image dans 10 ANS!!!! Ils parlent seulement de business mais jamais d'art. Ce qui est encore plus absurde c'est que vous ne savez m�me pas avec qui vous allez travailler, ou si vous allez avoir de la libert� sur vos cr�ations. Si cela ne fonctionne pas entre vous et eux, alors vous �tes foutus! Votre carri�re est finie! Dans l'industrie de la musique il n'y a pas de seconde chance! Alors, j ai d�cid� de rester moi m�me. Oui, je veux gagner de l'argent comme tout monde, mais c'est pas ce qui me fait me lever tous les matins. Je veux pouvoir vivre de ma musique sinc�rement avant tout. Cela m'a pris du temps pour comprendre ce que je voulais vraiment faire. Mais maintenant je suis pr�t! Dans un sens je dois dire merci � The Voice ! Merci, car ne pas signer avec eux, c'est ce qui m'a pouss� � sortir et � vivre ma propre exp�rience, j'ai pris mon ampli et ma guitare et j'ai r�alis� mon propre The Voice mais dans la rue cette fois!! Suite � cette exp�rience, je viens juste de finir d'enregistrer 3 titres, j'aimerais pouvoir les faire mixer par un professionnel pour en obtenir le meilleur. J'ai trouv� un super Ing�-Son ind�pendant ici � Angeles qui croit en moi et souhaite m'aider dans ma cr�ation. Mais pour que cela puisse se r�aliser j'ai besoin de vous !!! Ceci est mon histoire, si vous voulez m'encourager, participer et m'aider dans le lancement de ma carri�re. Alors, c'est par ici... Soutenez moi sur Kickstarter !!!! Avec $1000 je peux faire presser des CDs pour les vendre sur la route cet �t�. Avec $2000 je peux r�aliser un joli clip vid�o. Avec $3000 je peux investir dans la com, la promotion et cr�er mes propres goodies (T-shirts, casquettes....) Encore une fois, moi c'est DJINN. Merci d'avoir �cout� mon histoire."

I'm Caroline and I'm raising funds to help turn my handmade felt patches and custom embroidery into a viable business. I'm a person that is always making something or working on a project, so I initially started doing embroidery for fun over a year ago, after already having a solid sewing background using a machine. I figured I could make cool things for myself while still satisfying my need to constantly create (I'm a total nerd when it comes to all the grandma hobbies!). I started posting photos of my traditional-tattoo-inspired felt patches on social media and started receiving immediate interest from friends, family, tattooers, artists and small business owners who wanted to purchase my designs or have custom patches made with their own design or ideas. Over this past year, I have made patches for wedding parties, tattoo shops, food trucks, restaurants, birthday parties, stylists, motorcycle and car clubs... the list goes on. And I only want to continue to grow. I'm raising funds to help take my burgeoning embroidery business to the next level. I want to be able to: - Contribute to the rent of my work space for the next 6 months - Purchase enough materials to have on hand to aid in the production process (felt, embroidery floss, tracing paper, a light table, shipping materials, marketing materials, etc.) and purchase more comfortable, supportive chair to sit in as I spend hours and hours hand-stitching. - Provide better packaging for merchandising, and high-quality materials so that my patches and embroidery can continue to last the test of time and wear and - Expand my reach to my customers through advertising so that I can continue to create patches and embroidery that people will wear proudly and love I am the one-woman show behind this endeavor and do everything myself, from the design creation and drawing, to the stencil making and sewing, and I truly believe in the power of amazing handmade products. I chose the style of my patches to look like traditional, 1950s American-style tattoos to harken back to the days where rolling up your sleeves and doing it yourself was a commonplace endeavor. When soldiers were returning from WWII and starting motorcycle and car clubs. When Sailor Jerry was tattooing Navy boys in Hawaii. In other words, just solid, classic and bold styles. I would love to continue to create my unique designs and keep the quality and integrity of hand-sewn, custom items alive."

Immigration Nation is contemporary art with a purpose. It carries a message that is two-fold: celebration of our rich immigrant history, as well as recognition and empathy for current immigrant struggles. In a time when immigration policy has become a heart wrenching political topic, Porter (the great grandson of Lebanese, Greek, Italian and English immigrants) felt compelled to reclaim the uniting power of the word immigrant. ""We live in a time of profound polarization on the subject of immigration. Paradoxically, with the exception of Native Americans and African Americans forced into the U.S. through slave trade, every person in the U.S. has immigrant roots,"" says Porter. ""Our nation�s ideological divide has created a gap so large that our sense of unity is in question. Fortunately, art has the power to unite and when done with intention it can be a great balm to what ails us."" The American-born Jazz idiom has always welcomed the diversity of its multi-cultural constituents. Steeped in the jazz tradition, Charlie's writing explores the rich palette of human emotion involved in the immigration experience. The twelve compositions on the album include a wide range of global influences, including some from Porter�s own heritage, yet retain the core essence and language of jazz. In 2018, Charlie�s self-titled debut record garnered high praise and reviews by prominent publications such as DownBeat and Jazziz, as well as receiving worldwide airplay. After the success of Porter's debut, there is no doubt that this album will be received by an even wider audience. Giving Back Upon it's release, ten percent of all future album sales of Immigration Nation will be donated to the International Rescue Committe (IRC), to help refugees survive, recover and rebuild their lives.

If you can give more, we have some other great rewards (check them out to the right). Every bit helps, so please give what you can. Your contributions will help to ensure that we have what it takes to get this album off the ground. As you can imagine, there are lots of costs to cover, including: the recording studio & engineer, producer, mixing & mastering, fees for the musicians, cost of CD design and printing, etc. A minimum of $10,000 is necessary to cover most of these expenses. Any funds raised above the minimum goal will be used to pay for a PR campaign and radio promotion, which are paramount in getting the message out about the album and making sure it gets heard by the world. Thank you for your support! Project Image: The photo used for the project image was taken by Augustus Sherman. He worked as a clerk at Ellis Island in the years 1892-1925.

I'm Andy Smith and I've been a professional comic book artist for 25 plus years, whew, that is a long time! Some of my clients include Marvel, DC, Image, Valiant, Cross Gen, and now I'm with Ominous Press drawing Demi-God and I'm the company's art director. Check out some of my work at www.andysmithart.com. Go ahead take a peek, I'll be here when you're done perusing my work. I've written three previous books on comic book art as well, ""Drawing Dynamic Comics"", ""Drawing American Manga Superheroes"", and ""The How to Draw Superheroes Sketchbook"" which I did in association with Render Demo. Now I bring to you my first Kickstarter for the aspiring character designer in you! ""Dynamic Hero Templates"" The book!!! What a perfect book for you to design in and show your friends how cool you are! When I was a kid learning to draw, I had a lot of character design ideas rolling around in my head but I wasn�t at the talent level I envisioned in my head to put them down on paper in a way I was happy with. That�s the reason I created ""Dynamic Hero Templates"" so whether you are an aspiring artist or someone that likes to create characters but doesn�t want too deal with the hassle of trying too draw an accurate figure now you can just open this book and start creating your characters over my blue line figure templates! On the left is my first drawing of 1st Man done when I was a kid, not exactly to the professional level that I envisioned in my head. With this book you can design your character over the ideal figure template of your choice to give it a professional look! This book is for all ages and skill levels. If your young child shows an interest in art and making up characters this book is perfect for them. If you want to design characters that have a finished polished feel this book is for you. Instead of a crude drawing of a figure that doesn�t show your design in the best light now you can design over professional figure and head templates that will showcase your design at a professional level! Love superheroes? Create your own and with the multiple templates in the book you could create your own super team! Science fiction is a fantastic genre you can explore with some of the templates in the book too! Role playing games always have you create characters and now you can fully visualize them with this book and your imagination! And with the full page head templates you can show the details of your characters fantastic faces! The book measures 11"" x 8.5"" in landscape format so you have ample room to draw your designs and is 48 pages in length. The book includes 8 different types of male figure physiques so you have a variety of body types to use when designing your characters. The body type of a character is an important part in the overall character design so with these body type varieties you�ll be able to create an abundant number of characters each unique in its design and physicality. � The standard iconic hero physique, featuring two different bodies with subtle differences between them. � A dwarf physique. � A hulking over-sized physique. � A child physique. � A mid-teenager physique. � A heavy-set larger physique. � A lean, thinner physique. The body types in the book, each figure type is replicated three times for you to design over. Also included in the book are 6 different head types, front and � view, so you can design the head at a larger scale then the one on the figure template to accentuate the details of the head and face. � The standard male head. � The hulking brutish head. � The child male head. � The mid-teenager head. � The heavy-set head. � The lean, thinner head. A variety of heads to design details over of your character! Each is replicated three times in the book! This book will be able to lay flat on your table for you to easily create your characters in comfortably! Each figure and head type has three pages devoted to them so you have many options for each one! Some examples from the book. Don't worry my name won't be on the pages. Charlie McElvy example! I asked my buddy Charlie to pick a template and work up a design of his as an example to show what someone that isn't a professional artist can do. Charlie is known for ""The Official Handbook of the WatchGuard Universe"", ""The WatchGuard Source-book"" , and The Chemical Plant (a HeroClix� map) Charlie- ""Having created hundreds of characters on my own, and published dozens of them in various projects like ""The WatchGuard Source-book"", this project really spoke to me. I've used tools like Hero Machine, and others to help get me started, but what I've always needed was a set of templates that fit my goals. THANK YOU, ANDY!! This is exactly what I've always needed: base figures of various types, professional turnarounds, and a flexible set of templates from which to work. Perfect."" As you can see Charlie chose the Brutish figure template and went to town! Once finished he scanned his design and added some basic color. Now that's a tough looking character I'd like to draw!

All backers get a vote on whether Lilly Skyland kills or not and on whether Cupid lives or dies in Citizen Skyland. Check out some our other rewards below! We started Excavation Pictures in 2014 with the goal of producing original graphic novels that tell stories that are not addressed in mainstream media. We love our customers and believe they should help define the fate of our characters and our stories. We gave ourselves the test of publishing a feature-length graphic novel before coming to Kickstarter, and with Cupid: Under the Gold Knife (Volume I), we passed that test. We did everything ourselves, from developing the concept, to writing the script, to finding the perfect artist and traveling to comic cons to pitch our story to fellow comic book lovers. Since its release on Amazon and Comixology, Cupid Under the Gold Knife (Volume I) has maintained a perfect 5-star rating, reached the top-25 bestseller list for mystery graphic novels, and sold out at three comic cons. Cupid Under the Gold Knife Ranked #24 on Amazon's Top Mystery Graphic Novel List We put our money and time on the line to bring this to life -- our way. We were even able to get the extremely talented Glenn Fabry (cover artist for Vertigo�s Preacher series) to do our cover art without any industry connections. Now, we're looking to do it again with YOU and your help. We wouldn't ask for anything without giving you a part in the process and now that we're in a place to do that, we're excited to have you aboard in determining how the Cupid Series continues!

Cupid Under the Gold Knife (Volume 1) Cover | Artist Glenn Fabry Our first volume, Cupid: Under the Gold Knife, tells the story of Dr. Gabriel Kupidian, the world�s leading cardiothoracic surgeon. Dr. Kupidian works beneath the weight of his heavy heart, having lost his son to suicide. His celebrity status in the medical community has led to his staff dubbing him Dr. Cupid, because he mends broken hearts � literally. In his brilliance, Cupid has theorized a groundbreaking surgical technique that would allow him to alter a patient�s mind and personality through heart surgery. The procedure, named Eudemus after history�s first neurologist, alters the concentration of blood flow from the heart to the brain and vice versa in order to volumize certain regions of the brain that correspond with different behaviors. For example, a higher concentration of blood in the hypothalamus and a lower one in the amygdala produce a patient who is more docile and obedient and less aggressive, and the reverse concentration produces the opposite effects. Cupid has refused to perform the surgery since the suicide of his son, until one day when Agent Thomas Ozdemir of the FBI�s Behavioral Analysis Unit-2 recruits him. Ozdemir tells Cupid that the nation requires the good doctor�s medical expertise to save American lives, but what he really wants is Eudemus. The FBI has a captured terrorist on its hands and Ozdemir wants him to flip by any means necessary. As we pursue our mission of disrupting the comic book industry, we are coming to Kickstarter in the hopes that we can raise funds to produce and market the second graphic novel in the Cupid Universe, Citizen Skyland. In the process we would also like to bring our audience into the universe through voting on critical story arcs such as the life or death of Dr. Cupid and the mercy or vengeance of Lilly Skyland. Citizen Skyland Cover Art (Artist | Adam Brown) The second volume in the Cupid series is Citizen Skyland. It tells the story of Lilly Skyland, a recent graduate of the United States Military Academy, commonly known as West Point or simply Army. Like Cupid, Skyland is a celebrity in her field. As a cadet, her thesis work on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), or drones, advanced the army�s fleet decades ahead of schedule. Skyland�s genius was put to the test when she used her own proprietary UAV technology to rescue New York City from an attack during the Thanksgiving Day Parade. But also like Cupid, the spotlight doesn�t come naturally to Skyland. She has been tortured by her own work since the suicide of her older brother, Jon. A West Point graduate himself, Jon last met Skyland at the presentation of her thesis, Project Endangered. He had just returned home from his last tour of duty in Afghanistan as a UAV operator. The next day Jon was dead and Skyland was alone. But not for long. Because Agent Thomas Ozdemir of the FBI has his eyes on another prize.

We decided to name our company Excavation Pictures because we are constantly digging for original content, inspired by true stories. Cupid Under the Gold Knife (Volume 1) was inspired by both the mythical cherub we have all come to know and the late Dr. Tom Starzl who conducted the world�s first successful liver transplant. We wanted to tackle the issue of domestic terrorism through a hero whose powers were within his own two hands. His surgical expertise. The experience of publishing an original comic from start to finish was an exhilarating education. Interacting with comic book fans and getting the story out into the wild has only fueled our passion even more.

These two women were pivotal characters in shaping the plots of these two Shakespearian masterpieces, and yet � even though the pin hinge to the story of others � they are easily forgotten or often dismissed. After adding Jess Tanner (a then Kent graduate student) to the team, a script was developed by O'Keefe in which these two women could unravel the importance of their actions as characters in the eyes of their creator�and themselves. Aim�d so near (the new title for the most recent rendition of Best Intentions) first premiered at the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival before traveling to London, UK. And finally ending up at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the summer of 2016. �We always wanted this production to come home to Northeast Ohio where it was conceived, but we knew when we did it that we wanted to make some changes and explore more deeply the character�s desires and the dramatic resolution� of Aim�d so near, said O�Keefe, Artistic Director of Shark Eat Muffin Theatre Co. �You can only be in purgatory for so long before you finally decide � okay, how do I move on from here?� And now, in 2019 we present Aim�d so near as part of the inaugural BorderLight Fringe Festival in Cleveland OH in late July 2019. The Story of Aim�d so near | Two spirited women�a locked room�a tape recorder�and a kitten puzzle? Have these women met before? Their stories echo each other, but with a hazy recollection of the past while stuck in a mysterious room, it�s only a matter of time � or the lack thereof � before secrets creep out from all directions, and new and forgotten feelings take hold of the moment. Based upon two significant and courageous � but often overlooked � women from William Shakespeare�s classic dramas Romeo and Juliet and Othello. Join well-to-do Army wife Emilia and live-in nanny Angelica as they mine their memories to discover common flaws and the true reason for their confinement. They may have Aim�d so near, but will it be enough to free these women from the past or bind their fates forever."

Ex parte's are just a piece of paper."" The news from another state - "" The family of Vashti Forrest are shocked to learn of the tragic 'house fire' that took her life. Only her husband and 2 sons survived."" The HOPE? Grace in the midst of suffering. Not Too Far From Here takes a look at domestic violence through the lives of 2 teenage girls. Kaffa and Darian are from two different families and yet have a common ground. Darian understands her struggles. Her and her mother, Patty, are in hiding from a man who lives with bi-polar and sociopath tendencies and refuses to seek help. Kaffa is confused by hers. Her parents are loving, Christian professionals in their communities. Why she continues to have a re-occurring nightmare of her mother killing her father in a fit of rage terrifies her. Could she be foreseeing something yet to come? But they don't argue or fight at all. Darian believes that's a sign of hidden secrets and it's only a matter of time. This film takes a look at the reality of the suffering, what happens when secrets are kept, and the freedom and hope that truth brings. It addresses how adult decisions, or lack thereof, affect the children. 7 million children live in severe domestic violent homes and could potentially repeat patterns when they become adults. It's time to stop the chaos by addressing the issues of life. The struggle between fear based and love based emotions, and how the lack of knowledge on how to cope with normal life issues can spin out of control and lead to lives shattered. No matter if we want to admit it or not, it is happening in all of our worlds, Not Too Far From Here. People can move from hurt to hope in many life moments. This film will expose those tools for success. For those that have eyes to see and ears to hear and make different choices in their lives, they can kiss domestic good-bye in their lives without it being a violent departure. The funds raised from this campaign will go to the project to: Hire storyboard artist to work with the director and producer on structure. Secure gear needed for production. Begin casting contracts, secure shot locations and cover expenses needed for casting calls."

About the album Ordinary Love is my tenth recording and I know I say this every time, but I think it's going to be my favorite! I love the songs and I'm so excited to be working with so many incredible musicians here in Minneapolis. I've got the gals from The OK Factor on violin and cello, the women from Give Get Sistet share their powerful vocals, and a whole bunch of other local Minnesota folks. I've been working with Steve Kaul at Wild Sound Studios and it's been a joy to work locally. I am so excited to share two of the in-progress songs with you from this record featured in the video (Ordinary Love and The Finest Adventure). I reached my goal on June 20, 2019!!!! I am so thrilled that I know for sure that I have the funding to finish this recording, mix it with care, complete the album artwork design, the manufacturing of CDs, LPs, and other fun stuff. So now we're into the stretch goals! I really am hoping to raise $40- $50,000....If I do reach beyond my initial goal, I'd like to make music videos and hire a publicist and radio promoter to help this album really fly. Usually I make a record and spread it person by person, one show at a time. This time, I would love to try to land spots on NPR, in major music magazines, as well as in other mainstream media. And I can do all that, with your help! It's my hope that this Kickstarter campaign will give you a way to be a part of making all of this happen. There are a lot of options for sponsoring and dedicating songs, associate or executive producing the record, getting signed copies of the album, guitar lessons, and so much more! **Video photo credits: Thank you to Michael Charney, Steve Kaul & Terri Delaney for the wonderful photos! About Ellis About Ellis I am a contemporary folk artist. This is my 10th solo album. I can hardly believe how lucky I have been and continue to be in this indie folk music career. I suppose I always think my best songs are ahead of me, but y'all I think this collection will be my most mature and moving recording effort yet! For folks (maybe like you) who already know me, you know that it is my life�s work to practice being undefended and open; to write songs from that place and offer them wholeheartedly. I believe songs are powerful, and at their best, they can connect people to themselves and to one another. I LOVE recording my songs! It's a way to give them the chance to come to life outside of any live performance. I aspire to make recordings that are beautiful and feel alive like an oil painting with color, perspective, and depth, along with a story that lives inside each song that hopefully feels like an old friend. I want to inspire laughter and acceptance and appreciation of all the beautiful things right here without pushing away the troubles that can feel so heavy and break our hearts. I hope to make this an album that you love, and become friends with, and that you want to carry around with you every single day. I can't wait for you to hear it."

You can also use it as a choice of 5x7 or 8x10. 5x7 Prints & 5x7 Double-Matted Prints All 5x7 and 8x10 prints are professionally produced on Kodak Professional Endura Premier paper with a lustre sheen. It generally takes about a week from when I place the order with the lab to have it delivered to my doorstep. I will then sign, mat and bag each item.

I'm normally the one behind the camera, not in front of it, so this is basically the equivalent of a digital dunk-tank. At this level of funding, I can fully produce my initial stock of 5x7 photos, mats, bags, etc. and start selling them locally. Bonus 2 At $1,000, I'll add the names of any backer (if you indicate you want it added) to my website and to the LLC's website when it launches for a minimum of 180 days. I'll come up with some clever tier titles and announce it across my social channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest). Every backer will also get a Thank You postcard (but not more than one). Bonus 3 At $1,500, I'll unlock holographic labels and Certificates of Authenticity for each matted print and metal print sent to Backers. Normally holographs and certificates will only be used on 11x14 and larger prints, so you'd be getting a very unique and limited reward. Funding me at this level will allow me to stock all 5x7, 8x10 and 11x14 prints, mats and materials needed for the first art show sale. Above and beyond Of course, this is just the Kickstarter. Once we move beyond Bonus 3, I'll be better able to invest in the business with a display tent, display panels, and other equipment needed to run a booth at an art show."

With your help, we will be able to finish our most ambitious musical project to date! Our Folk Opera will combine the unique sound and perspective we have developed as experienced musicians and performers with a socially relevant storyline and a score intentionally composed with traditional folk instrumentation. At this time, the writing process is nearly complete. This is just step one, however, as we prepare to record, engineer, and promote the album. We couldn't be more excited about the creatively challenging work that lies ahead. We can't wait to have the finished album and artwork to ship off to you and present to the world! Our Folk Opera idea began three years ago in the studio as we were recording our second album ""Till We Know Better."" While building sound effects for some of the story centered songs, we laughed about how fun it would be to write a complete concept album in our style of acoustic folk. Like many of our musical heroes before us had written ""rock operas"", we jokingly decided that the world needed a ""folk opera"", and we would be just the folks to write it. How were we to know that our pie in the sky idea would turn into the most creatively fueled project of our lives? We have spent the last two and a half years formulating the characters and storyline, composing thematically motivated music, and brainstorming ways to make the Folk Opera the best it can be. This included putting together a team full of award-winning and critically acclaimed musicians, artists, engineers, and producers. Our goal is to deliver a concept album that combines our love of theater with our passion for songwriting and folk music. The Folk Opera is driven by character development, socially relevant subject matter, soaring melodic themes, and compelling visual art. Here are a couple images from our January trip out to GNAH Studios Inc in Los Angeles where we did our first Folk Opera artwork meeting. First meeting in LA with our Folk Opera artist, Avi Renick At GNAH Studios Inc. in Los Angeles Our award winning artist, Avi Renick, will be creating original artwork for all the characters and locations in the story.

Those featured in this book share their feelings about their disability with candid photographs that expose readers to the lives of a group of teens experiencing adult hood. As a Program Director for an internship program that serves blind and visually impaired young adults, this is a project that I feel will shed new light on people with visual impairments. Watching the participants in my program grow right before my eyes as they go through different work experiences through out the year has been a blessing. But this book is not a promotional tool for my program, it is to inform people that despite a visual impairment, these young adults from diverse backgrounds are eager to find their way in the world and show others what they can do, how they do it, and what they go through along the way. The young adults featured in this book will be photographed during their summer 2019 work semester. Each working at a different site of their choice, all with different career goals. If all goes well with the book, a documentary will follow."

This girl. My sister, Caiden. She's always been an artist, but she's never been recognized. I'm hoping you all can help me change that. Right now she works at an airport and draws in her spare time. These are fun little doodles she does to pass the time, and I think they'd be great stickers! I hope you do too. Most of the money will go straight to supporting Caiden, and helping her pursue more of her passion. What doesn't go to Caiden, will go to making your stickers.

What if there was a way to experience the Enneagram metaphorically -- something that felt like a drone photo of the path ahead, a map folded up in your pocket, and maybe, perhaps even a mirror of yourself. Could it make all of this human experience less morpheus, and a little bit more tangible? Could we better understand and give grace to each other, if we knew the kind of path they tread? These questions were inspired by my time painting the artwork for Sleeping at Last's ""Four"" music video, and I set out on a nine month deep-dive into enneagram theory, and how to translate our shared experiences as humans, into landscapes -- into art. Over the months that followed I read books, listened to podcasts, poured over enneagram-based songs, spoke with hundreds of people, and studied the language our Earth already uses. I wanted these paintings to be tied to real places in the world, places our feet really can traverse, as that would give even more grounding to what we experience in our minds and hearts, which can sometimes feel like a vast and overwhelming expanse. As much fun as it would be (and how much easier on me as the artist!) these are not paintings of what each Enneagram type likes. Instead, I�m aiming to represent who they are. And to do this I had to reach beyond myself and my own interpretations of life. I asked hundreds of people these questions: ""If your internal landscape was an actual place here on Earth, what would it be? What biosphere could be used to represent what it feels like to be you, and what your journey looks like? If your internal processing, fears, motivations, virtues were a landscape, what would it be?"" Compiling their answers, my understanding of Enneagram theory, and my interpretation of the world's textures, I created a sort of vocabulary that I could pull from to create these maps. [CLICK HERE TO SEE THE PLACES IN THE NATURAL WORLD THAT INSPIRED EACH PIECE] I wanted the paintings to ""read"" from left to right, coming from the disintegration type and childhood wound, and traveling across the landscape, heading into health. I wanted each piece to depict a different biosphere, and capture the vast variety and beauty of both our world and humanity. I wanted the depictions to include the type's distraction possibility, fear, obstacles, core struggle, growth point, and virtue. And above all, when a piece was on the wall of its type, I wanted it to feel familiar. After each painting, I shared it with a core community of each type, hearing their interpretations and insights, tweaking things when it was needed, and processing with them. You guys were AMAZING! And this project honestly wouldn't be what it is apart from you! I said it so many times during that process, and I'll say it many more: I feel so honored and privileged to be able to do this project with and for people like you! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ After months of painting, study, and repainting, here are the Nine base Enneagram pieces! WANT TO KNOW THE INSPIRATION, METAPHORS, EASTER EGGS, AND MORE HIDDEN WITHIN YOUR PIECE? When you support this project you will get exclusive access to videos I am sharing throughout this campaign. There is one video for each painting, showing the planning, inspiration, hidden metaphors, time-lapse of its creation, and more. These videos have been incredibly encouraging to the backers who have watched them, and I hope they will encourage you as well. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE Because these maps were done reading left to right, the paintings can be lined up by their integration direction!! Like this: This is an easy way to see which type you pull from in stress (taking on that type's negative characteristics) and which type you lean into in growth (taking on their positive characteristics.) For example, if you are a Nine, you pull from Six in stress, and lean into Three in growth. Not only can these effects be seen in each painting, but when lined up, you can see the story of our human experiences carry through each piece! And let me just say, we humans are pretty dang amazing together! Now, if you know your Enneagram theory, you know there's a core part to this whole thing we haven't talked about yet. Where are the wings? Never fear, friends. Using a double-exposure technique (yes, think a digital version of the film photography technique) I overlaid the paths of each Enneagram wing pairing (there are 18!) to create images for every one! 9w8 is different than 8w9 after all! CLICK BELOW TO WATCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN WINGS: [Seen here: 7 - 7w8 - 8w7 - 8 - 8w9 - 9w8 - 9] You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 That means, in total, there are 27 images -- 9 base types + 18 wing pairings! Whichever map you resonate with most can now be in your hands and on your wall -- a constant reminder of your beauty and the beauty of your journey! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ALRIGHT, HOW DO I GET THESE IN MY HOME? You are in the right place! This Kickstarter campaign is the first and currently the only place to purchase these prints! We want to cover costs of their creation, and fund their distribution out into the world! There are three sizes to choose from, and all are made to be durable, ready to be displayed wherever you need an encouraging reminder. Printed on metallic paper, they literally GLOW, and because they are mounted on 2mm styrene, and sprayed with a luster coating, they can be hung directly on a wall, sit on a display shelf, go in a glass-less frame, or almost any other standard frame! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HIT THE FUNDING GOAL? The FUN has only just begun! Here's what else we would like to do: 10K STRETCH GOAL -- NEW REWARD TIER: After seeing the impact these paintings can have on the community -- how it can shine a light on our journey towards health, and help us see each other and ourselves with more grace -- I want to create a functional tool that can bring this artwork off the walls and into your conversations. We came up with the idea to make a pocket-sized box set, with all 27 paintings, and the explanation for each written on the back. I see these being a wonderful tool for coaches, and for communities who want to explore the enneagram together. The cards are printed on plastic, completely washable, durable, and perfect for spreading out on the coffee shop table. I would love to make these a reality, and need your help to do it! > > AND YOU DID IT! < < On day 10 of this campaign you shot us past our 10K stretch goal, making the production of these cards possible! Here's a short video of their features! What you see here: There will be cards with all 27 paintings on the fronts (this sample pack only has the ones that were completed when we ordered it.) The back of each painting will have information on the type, and the metaphors in the painting. There are additional cards with info on the project, how to read the paintings, and basic enneagram info. The titles of the types on the top of the card are color coded for ease in finding a specific type. Flexible, non-tearing, won't crease or fold. Can line up by number, wings, or integration direction. Coffee-safe, washable, waterproof. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 NEXT STRETCH GOAL @ $15,000 If we hit $15,000 before the end of the campaign I will open the option for you to get a CUSTOM DOUBLE-EXPOSURE, with any landscapes you choose! These are surprisingly time-consuming original creations using a digital technique to layer the paintings I created. Each one takes a few hours to perfect -- longer than it takes to paint it in the first place! There are many different implementations of this concept! Think relationship combination, tritype, etc. Here's a time-lapse of the **first half** of a combination of 1w9 and 7w8: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 And the finished product as an example of what you can have created especially for you! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT THIS PROJECT? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ENNEAGRAM? IS THERE A TEST? I do not usually suggest Enneagram tests as a way to type yourself. Having studied the creation of psych tests/assessments, and how to make accurate personality tests, the Enneagram is very hard to test accurately. That said, Your Enneagram Coach came out with a new *FREE* test recently, and it has had very good results. You can take it here. And my suggestion? Look into the top 2-3 type results. There are great resources on the test's site, as well as simple references at The Enneagram Institute. Study the core fears, motivations, virtues, levels of health, etc. of your results, and see which fits you best! Remain a student, don't feel stuck, and see where this journey takes you! The resources below will also help a TON! TO READ: I cannot suggest Chris Heuertz's book ""The Sacred Enneagram"" too highly. It is a fantastic, grace-filled, growth-focused resource. I have mine within arm's reach most of the day. FIND IT IN A BOOKSTORE NEAR YOU, OR BUY A COPY ON AMAZON! Other good Enneagram books I've read are ""The Road Back to You"" by Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile, and it's amazing follow-up ""The Path Between Us"" by Suzanne Stabile. TO LISTEN: The above books can be found as audiobooks, but when you want to stretch beyond book format, here are some absolutely incredible resources. PODCAST Ryan O'Neal of Sleeping at Last, and Chris Heuertz of ""The Sacred Enneagram"" come together in an incredible podcast series, discussing each Enneagram type, and the song Ryan created for them. YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THESE. I've cried at nearly every single one. Listen on Spotify or iTunes. The final podcast Episode, for Enneagram Nine just released today (June 7th) and you can listen to it here! MUSIC As mentioned above, Sleeping at Last has been crafting songs for each Enneagram type, and every adjective I could use would fall immensely short. They are works of art -- beautiful and packed full of grace. (This is actually how I discovered the Enneagram!) If you have an idea which Enneagram type you might be, go check them out, and bring the tissues! ""One"" through ""Eight"" are on Spotify, and ""Nine"" is releasing on June 7th -- during this campaign! This will finish out the Enneagram series he began over a year ago! You don't want to miss it! ""Nine"" is out! Listen to it here! DEEP DIVE: Want to deep-dive into this whole enneagram thing? Then I have a course for you! Beth McCord of Your Enneagram Coach, has created amazing grace-filled and growth-oriented courses. Having worked with her throughout this project, I can guarantee that you will come away enCOURAGEd, enriched, and ready. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I HAVE SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR! And to all of my family, community, those on Instagram/Facebook, or ""in real life"", thanks for letting me deep-dive into the Enneagram and for geeking out with me. Thank you for the hundreds of conversations, for the encouragement, reflection, redirection. Thank you for sharing your stories, with me. They are gold, that I hope in some way I have melted down into the very ink of these paintings. I hope you feel honored. I hope you feel you belong. I hope you know you are loved, dear ones. This is for you. Beth McCord, thank you for the amazing generosity of your time and spirit. You cheered me on, checked in on me, let me ramble, and geeked out with me over all of these mutual passions. Thank you for being a second pair of eyes, and for believing in my vision for this project. Chris Heuertz, thank you for your wonderful, grace-filled interpretation of the Enneagram. Between your podcasts, your amazing book, and checking in over email, I felt like I constantly had a place where I could get grounded, and remember the deep & good truths. Ryan O'Neal, this project is finally happening, and you are such a core foundation in this story! Thanks for finding me last year and bringing me along in your amazing work. Thanks for geeking out with me about the Enneagram over the phone and in the studio, and for being the first person to say, ""Hey, that painting looks like an Eight!"" In the midst of creating your own incredible work with the Enneagram, you've cheered this on, and been such an inspiration. Your songs are the backbone of these artworks and hope they can echo even the slightest melody of the gift you've given this world. Leslie, so many of our conversations over the last few months revolved around the Enneagram on this project. You sat on the porch with me and let me rant, ramble, process, fall apart, and come back together. You're to thank for having the idea that Threes could be depicted as a desert, for the underwater volcano in Nine, and for thinking of Antelope Canyon for Six but letting me come to it on my own. I can't think of my journey in this project without remembering all our conversations, and I can't thank you enough. Now we're 900 miles apart, but this art is forever a memorial of our collaboration, and the beauty of our shared human experiences. Paul, my dear husband, through this crazy year of transitions, your constant reminders were such an encouragement to me. ""What about that enneagram project?"" ""You still hoping to launch your project in May?"" And when the time came to sprint you sprinted with me. Late nights, early mornings, teaching me to use Slack and then fixing it for me when I did it wrong. You're always the strength and ambition and adventure in these projects, and I'm so excited to add another one to our list. You're my favorite. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MUSIC: ""Seven (Instrumental)"" by SLEEPING AT LAST VIDEO: Created by Alexander Jones of DNA VISIONS VA SURVEYS, ADD-ON STORE, AND POST-CAMPAIGN SUPPORT PROVIDED BY:"

It's Pride Month. You deserve to be proud. Sometimes it�s hard to show your pride. Sometimes people call you fake, or say you don�t belong, but you can�t be afraid. You are valid and you will not be erased. PRIDE PINS is a collection of enamel pins displaying animals holding pride flags. Show your pride. You deserve it. Fursona Pins proudly brings you high quality enamel pins. Our previous Kickstarter campaign, Carry the Stars in Your Hands, was an enormous success, raising $23,473 by its amazing backers. Over ten thousand pins were delivered to customers who backed the campaign and purchased over $6,800 in add-ons through Backerkit afterwards, putting the final total at over $30,000 raised in our first campaign. This new campaign is more ambitious. With a final stretch goal of $40,000, we're excited to bring you an amazing set of pins representing LGBT identities. When you back Pride Pins or purchase anything from Fursona Pins, you can confidently know you're purchasing from a minority and LGBT-owned business. Representation is crucially important. We are proud to do our part. Will you join us? Let's begin! Last 24 Hours! Pride Pins is currently the #1 most funded enamel pin Kickstarter in history, and the most funded LGBT project live on Kickstarter right now. That's all thanks to you, our amazing backers! Current Stretch Goal: We are pleased to present a campaign where your identity is NOT a stretch goal. Each milestone represents the unlocking of all flags for each animal. The identities we are proud to represent in our campaign are below... as introduced by our campaign mascots, the Pride Pals: Flynn the Fox is our Pride Pal for the Gay Pride Flag. Also known as the Rainbow Flag, the Pride Flag, or the LGBT Flag, this flag is flown to show solidarity among all LGBT folks. Wilde the Wolf is our Pride Pal for the Bisexual Pride Flag.

It is flown to show support for lesbian identities: women who are attracted to other women. Riley the Red Panda is our Pride Pal for the Pansexual Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for pansexual identity: attraction to all (or regardless of) genders. Corbin the Cheetah is our Pride Pal for the Asexual Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for asexual identity: a lack of sexual attraction to any gender. Dakota the Deer is our Pride Pal for the Demisexual Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for demisexual identities: those who only experience sexual attraction with a strong emotional bond. Desi the Dragon is our Pride Pal for the Polyamory Flag. It is flown to show support for polyamory identity: consensual intimate relationships with more than one partner. Toby the Tiger is our Pride Pal for the Transgender Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for transgender identity: identifying as a gender other than the one assigned at birth. Willow the Wild Dog is our Pride Pal for the Genderfluid Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for genderfluid identity: one who does not identify as having a fixed gender. Finn the Fennec is our Pride Pal for the Genderqueer Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for genderqueer identity: one who identifies with neither, both, or a combination of male and female genders. Seth the Shark is our Pride Pal for the Polysexual Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for polysexual identity: attraction to multiple genders but not all. Raz the Rat is our Pride Pal for the Agender Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for agender identity: one who is genderless or lacking gender. Robin the Rabbit is our Pride Pal for the Aromantic Pride Flag. It is flown to show support for aromantic identity: one who is without romantic attraction.

Though our Pride Pals are super cute, the fun doesn't end there. You can mix and match our unlocked species and any pride flag you wish. Read on to see which species we have unlocked throughout the course of this campaign! Pride Pins is the #1 LGBT Kickstarter live right now. We want to be more inclusive, too! The following Pride Pals enamel pins are available exactly as-is: these flags are only present on their exact animal below, and are not available to the other species. We have these Pride Pals because we want to include other identities that have been requested throughout the campaign to be more inclusive for all our customers! More coming. This campaign features twenty five beautiful animals. Remember, your identity is not a stretch goal. When an animal unlocks, all of its flags unlock with it. Did you know... you can pledge now and pay later? Pledge for all the pins you want at the end of the campaign. Kickstarter doesn't charge you until the campaign ends. Even if the pins you want haven't unlocked yet, pledging your full desired amount will help push the campaign toward unlocking those pins.

This is perfect for dealers who want a nice stock of pins for their shop or cons!

Let us know what the flag looks like and what it represents, as well as which animal you'd like it drawn onto. Custom Animal Is your favorite animal not available during the campaign, but you'd love to give other backers a chance to enjoy that animal as a pin? If you add $1,500 extra to your pledge, you can immediate fund a new animal of your choice. That animal and its fifteen flags then becomes available to all backers through Backerkit, and the official Pride Pins shop (at our discretion). A Custom Animal order comes with 25 copies of each flag of the pin you have created (375 pins--or about $4 per pin) for you to sell or trade. Animal species are subject to approval. We cannot create copyrighted fantasy species unless you own the copyright to that species, but we can create real life animals and generic fantasy animals. Backers who order a custom animal are welcome to re-order their custom animal pins in the future through FursonaPins.com. This is perfect for creators of fandom species or dealers who want a nice stock of pins for their shop or cons! Please contact us for approval by messaging us on Kickstarter if you would like to order a custom animal through this campaign.

Not only is it embarrassing when I have to say sorry every time I take for ever but I loose clients and that is my bread and butter for my family, even when I bring my prices down for taking so long most of them don't come back. I'm in love with what I do but because of the pain shooting in my hands it's hard to hold items in my hands and at times I loose the strength in my hands and do to that I can't hold certain jobs witch make it hard for me to provide for my family financially when I can't book people for nail sets. I'm not able to work fast but man can I sure make some beautiful art work when I can take my time. I know how to mix and make amazing acrylic colors and for this reason I know deep inside of me that I can make a small business with personal colored acrylics grow like wild fire and this would help me tremendously to make ends meet. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my story and hope that not only can you provide me with your support but also know that you are making a huge difference in my family's life since I plan to leave this business to my children. All of this will be possible with the beautiful seed you planted. Thank You!!"

Welcome to my Kickstarter! When I first decided to leave Jehovah�s Witnesses, I knew that I wanted to eventually pen my story. However, at first I struggled with finding my own special angle. I hadn�t done anything that thousands of other young men in the organization hadn�t already done. I graduated high school, pioneered straight away, qualified to become a ministerial servant while still a teenager, and waited for my time to arrive until I finally received the letter that so many young Jehovah's Witness men covet: �Dear Brother Johnson. We are pleased to inform you that your services are needed at Bethel.� I have read around a dozen books published by former Jehovah's Witnesses. I have read a few more dozen forum posts of life stories from people that had realized that Jehovah�s Witnesses do not actually have �The Truth."" There seemed to be nothing especially outstanding about my story. But that�s when it occurred to me; there isn�t anything special about my story. That�s what makes my story so important. By all accounts, there is no reason why I should have woken up from the indoctrination into the religion of my parents. In my teenage years, being one of Jehovah's Witnesses wasn�t exactly my burning desire. Even so, I never considered leaving it altogether. Become inactive? Maybe. Be disciplined? Sure. But never in my life did I think that I would ever put my foot down and say: �This isn�t the truth, I�m leaving.� I have read stories of people that went through hell with their parents or elders in their congregations. Some were sexually abused, physically assaulted, and emotionally tortured. There are some terrible stories about what people experienced as a result of being one of Jehovah�s Witnesses. I was fortunate in that I never had to experience anything like that. I have to admit that I had a really good upbringing. This is why I feel my story is so important. My story isn't the outlier; it's the norm. I am living proof that anyone can wake up from the indoctrination of Jehovah�s Witnesses. I never set out to be a �JW Activist�. It just kind of fell in my lap. I originally started writing about my experience in my English 201 class. My professor indulged me as I completed every assignment for that class writing papers about my time spent as a JW. For the capstone project, we were supposed to create an informational document about an important social issue. A brochure, a poster board, a blog, a YouTube video. When she and I were discussing what I was going to do, she said she thought a perfect project for me would be to make a blog and contribute a few articles about my time as a JW. Thus, JW Rebuttal was born. I originally intended it to be merely a thought experiment. I have long wanted to be a writer, and so I intended the blog to be a way of me forcing myself to write more. Plus I had wanted to remain anonymous, and the blog allowed me to write under the pen name �Mark Harris�, a character from my favorite book of all time. Sadly, life doesn�t ever go according to plan. In June of 2018, I could no longer hide the fact that I didn�t want to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses anymore. It just didn�t seem worth it to me. My parents kicked me out of their house and I found myself with my entire world taken away from me. To keep myself from going crazy, I thought that I would create a video where I simply talked to the camera about my experience. I set up my phone on a makeshift tripod using a stack of my schoolbooks, sat on my $150 Costco mattress that was laying on the floor, hit record and just kept talking. I did three takes, did a little editing, and despite my best efforts 98 minutes was as short as I could get it. I uploaded this video thinking nobody would ever watch it. It didn�t matter anyways. I was merely using it as a springboard for me to post my rants on YouTube and talk about my desire to run away. I went to bed, not knowing what I would wake up to. 1000 views. 2000 views. 5000 views. 10,000 views. The video had gone semi-viral in the exJW community on YouTube, and as a result I began to receive hundreds of messages of love and support. The video finally slowed down around 60,000 views after merely a few months, but still gains a few hundred a month. At the time of writing this, it sits at just shy of 90,000 views. Not only did a lot of people watch my story video, but a lot of them actually subscribed to my channel. As I continued to upload videos where I would just ramble about my experience as a JW, my subscriber count kept going up, and so did the people reaching out to me on social media. That's why I say that I ""accidentally became a JW activist."" I thought, as JW activists do, that I should share my complete story in a book that people can read. Heck, even if nobody reads it, at least I�d have the satisfaction of knowing that I had completed my life�s dream and written a book that I was passionate about. But even so, I knew that I needed to find my own unique angle. It wasn't until I read Amber Scorah's book about her amazing experience waking up as a JW missionary in China that I finally realized what I wanted to do. Her story is in my top 3 pieces of exJW content of all time, and now she released a full book! I read the entire thing in one sitting. Her book breathed new life into me. I sat down that night to sketch out my own memoir and I wrote just shy of 20,000 words in a straight eight hour session. Something that I have struggled with my entire life is learning to put the past behind me. When you wake up one day and realize that you have given 25 years of your life to a cult, that feeling of �a life wasted� becomes so strong that it can paralyze you. This book is me saying goodbye to the past once and for all. It's a letter to 17 year old me. It's the advice I wish I had received instead of the words of encouragement from that elder 10 years ago..."

This can just be a fun build and it gives you a few tips for anyone who has or hasn�t woodworked before. For beginners this will help you get started in your woodworking adventure. All the pieces come precut. Why I Decided to Make the Woodworking Kit I created this kit for several reasons. I loved building lego sets as a kid and every birthday and Christmas that�s all I would ask for. I grew out of legos and was looking for a fun hobby to do and discovered woodworking. I designed my first project and then realized the amount of tools I needed. I was fortunate enough to receive some of my neighbors old tools which helped me start but realized how do other people get started with a low budget and thought of making building kits. Another reason I created these kits was because I loved building lego sets but then I would never know what to do when I was done. I would play with them for a few days, then they would just gain dust around my house. This kit creates three builds that you can use and keep forever. Who I Am My name is Thomas Temperley and I am 14 years old. I�ve enjoyed building almost anything since I was a little boy. It started with legos and moved to woodworking. I also attended a program called YEA(Young Entrepreneur Academy) which helped me create my business. This taught me a lot about starting a business. What�s Included All you need is a hammer and tape, everything else is included in this kit. You will get a barcode that you scan and there is a video from opening the box to admiring your creations. Each kit has the materials for a tissue box, picture frame and tool box. Kit(Snow White) This shows the Snow White kit once you have finished building and painting it. Tissue Box This is the tissue box that comes in your kit. The wood is 1/2 in wide and the dimensions of the box are shown above Picture frame This is the Picture Frame that also comes in your kit. This can fit a standard pice of paper with the dimensions shown above. Tool Box This is the tool box that is also included in your kit. This can hold all your household tools, your art supplies, school materials or whatever your mind limits you to."

Creole Amour is a laser cut and handmade jewelry brand inspired by travel experiences and the culture of New Orleans. We believe in crafting lasting pieces that won't tarnish or break with everyday use, so our jewelry is created using 14k gold filled and laser cut acrylic. CA gives back by donating 10% of profits to nonprofit organizations that have a positive impact on the community through programs and opportunities for the youth and those who are less fortunate. Creole Amour is now expanding this approach by helping you create your most inspired space through decor and ultimately helping to create an inspired life. Why these rewards? These rewards are a good representation of influences and experiences from travel and the culture New Orleans made into decor and accessories that inspire a good feeling environment. If you've already watched our video, then you know that through travels I, Kiki, found how important it was to feel inspired, feel motivated, and overall just feel good while I was away from family and the city that I love. It became obvious that the vibes and how I felt in my temporary homes had a significant impact in my mood and life, so I set out to create an environment that I loved and inspired me no matter where I was. It has been life changing for me, so I want to share with others. Why a Kickstarter? Literally, for years I've been a fan off Kickstarter and planned one day to launch a campaign for Creole Amour. It just seemed like the right time to move forward in helping others feel inspired in their spaces with our designs, and finally purchase a laser cutter to not only expand but to host workshops to help inspire the youth and others to create and unleash their wildest imaginations. What's the budget? This kickstarter is to raise $7,900 in order to buy a small laser cutter that will be life changing for this business. $6,650 will go towards the actual purchase of the laser cutter, while $500 will go towards purchasing materials to create and ship your beautiful rewards, $200 will go towards funding our very first workshop, and the rest goes to Kickstarter and payment processing fees. While $7,900 will fund purchasing a laser cutter, if this campaign does so well and exceeds this amount, my next goal is to raise enough to purchase a larger more powerful laser cutter, which runs about $15,000. What's the timeline? After this campaign is successfully funded in 30 days, l immediately purchase the new CA laser cutter. We will take the month of July and August to purchase materials and start making your amazing rewards. By September we plan to start shipping rewards and getting them to you asap! What's the bigger picture? A part of what I do with Creole Amour through jewelry is share my story and experiences through designs while also giving back 10% of profits to nonprofit organizations that help the youth and those less fortunate to live fulfilling lives. As mentioned before, having a laser cutter will allow Creole Amour to go out and directly impact others by helping them to see all that they can create from their imaginations in the laser cutting world and ultimately in their life (as long as they can see it, they can create the life they want). I don't plan to stop there. At some point Creole Amour will grown enough to employ others who need jobs to get them on their feet to live their best life. Also, this laser cutter will help to save money from laser cutting expenses and remove time restraints and accessibility issues that come with not owning a laser cutter. ----The Rewards---- All wall signs and decor is hung using command strips. No signs will require nails or push pins. Most are relatively light and using the correct strength commander strips will hold wall decor in place. Any rewards that require a choice in material, color, etc. will be communicated via messages and surveys after the campaign is has ended and is successfully funded.

With The Curse of Roslof Keep, I�ve had the pleasure of designing a high level dungeon crawl, and Folio #23 will be the fourth installment of this particular dungeon. This particular crawl, known as The Kasbah Dungeon, features players taking on the DM as he or she assumes the role of The Infernal Machine that has been driven mad by a dark elder power beyond our own dimension. The players will have to defeat the monsters within the fourth level of the dungeon as well as try to figure out how to 'reboot' the Infernal Machine and wrest the control over the monster generator from the lurking darkness that threatens this world! I�m truly excited to journey in Level Four of The Kasbah Dungeon and to see what dastardly threats the Infernal Machine has in store for the players! What is included in Folio #23? This module will provide the adventurers with access to Level 4 of the Kasbah Dungeon as well as a new monster that even threatens the existence of the Infernal Machine. Dungeon details include 2D standard 'blue' hex maps as well as fully 3D renderings of Level 4. It also features a fully removable stand-alone cover that can act as DM screen. Send your high level party through the first 3 levels of the Kasbah Dungeon with Folios #20-23! Who is this adventure for?: It will be based around classic AD&D gaming mechanics, while also have 'grey' stat and treasure blocks for 5th Edition D&D, so it is easily playable in BOTH formats. It has been designed for 6-8 characters, roughly levels 11 thru 13, and will include a Virtual Table Top map without secret doors, traps, and numbers. Check out the incredible 3D maps! What are the 'Bridge' Mini-Adventure Trios? There are 2 sets of mini-adventures, the first three help characters transition for the original Roslof Keep campaign to the new Kasbah Dungeon campaign. The second three are set within the happenings of the Kasbah Dungeon and help add content to the first three levels of the dungeon. They each have a map, and a 10-15 room dungeon that will add magic, experience, and content to the overall campaign arc. What are all the other Folio products? The bulk of my Folio adventure series has been in physical form and can be found at artofthegenre.com. For the purposes of some of the upper pledge levels, these previously produced adventures are offered at a substantial savings. Thus far, there have been 22 Folio standard removable cover adventures, and 5 hardcover Folio books (3 compile and reprint the Folio campaigns, and 2 are gaming supplements). You can see more about these products in the video below. For the Hardcover pledge, what are the 'Orange Spine' books?: These 'Complete' volume hardcovers include not only all the information from 6 Folio adventure modules, but also 6 or more 'mini-adventure' supplements added for extra content, iconic character cards that are playable, and a gazetteer supplement that defines the world the adventure takes place in. Also included is the Storyteller's Arcana, a 128 page DM & Player guide of my own tips and experiences in 30 years of gaming, and the Folio of Fiendish Monsters with 115 new monsters. ALL these books are in in both AD&D and 5th Edition D&D formats. 4 of your incredible hardcovers! *TRADEMARK DISCLAIMER ""D&D"" and ""AD&D"" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

Back today and receive 6 Exclusive Characters and an Art Book which will not be available to mass market! Overview: The Refuge: Terror from the Deep takes you into treacherous waters with a 2-6 player competitive dive and a 1-4 player solo and cooperative dive. Compete with rival divers in a frantic race to the escape pods, or work together in a story-driven experience to defeat the kraken! Whichever game mode you choose, you'll be one of eight asymmetric characters in an immersive, cinematic experience that takes you head to head with an angry Kraken! The Refuge: Terror from the Deep includes 25 gorgeous miniatures. We have been fortunate enough to work with two amazing sculptors: David Whitaker & Tom Lishman. David's work includes minis for Lord of the Rings: Journeys into Middle Earth, Moonstone, and more. Tom has sculpted for games such as Dark Souls: the Board Game, Descent 2nd Edition, and Godtear. We're incredibly excited about the miniatures in The Refuge: Terror from the Deep, and we think you will be too. A larger scale brings out more details and make minis easier to handle and paint. Painted by Den of Imagination. Miniatures supplied unpainted. The Refuge: Terror from the Deep's competitive dive is based on our 2016 release The Refuge: A Race for Survival. The Refuge: a race for survival continues to be enjoyed by gamers all over the world, and is well-received for combining exciting, fast-paced gameplay with simple mechanics. We're excited to take that to the next level in competitive dive � an action filled race to the finish! Escape The Kraken � or Die Trying In competitive dives, 2-6 players race to the escape pods of the mysterious UB-85 submarine. To reach the refuge of the escape pods, players must carefully plan their movement to outwit their opponents � and to avoid the Kraken's wrath! To win, be the first diver to reach the escape pods at the end of the board with a Decryptor or complete an Objective for the key to a specific pod. On your turn, you take one action: Move your character one space and activate the space you land on Draw a Salvage card Play a Salvage card Use one of your character's abilities As you move, you'll activate spaces on the board with special features: Spawn spaces let you place pesky tentacles on other unoccupied Spawn spaces. Cave spaces are safe and tentacles can't reach you there. Whirlpool spaces let you switch with a player who is currently on a Cave. Lair spaces lets you control the Kraken's tentacles to knock defenseless characters back to the start. Card Driven Combos: Combining your hand of Salvage cards, Character abilities, and movement allows you to chain together devastating moves � propelling you toward the final goal and luring tentacles to attack your opponents. Don't wait too long to string together the perfect combination though: a slow start means there will be a dozen tentacles blocking your path! Solo and Cooperative dives bring you an immersive, cinematic experience in the world of The Refuge. 1-4 divers will work together to solve a series of challenging objectives deep beneath the sea � as the Kraken threatens to overwhelm them. The victory conditions change every game, providing new challenges and puzzles each time you dive (especially as you try each of the asymmetric characters). All the action of an underwater monster movie in 30 minutes! Story-driven Experience To win, you'll need to complete all three objectives without being overwhelmed by the Kraken. Each Objective drives a little more of your undersea story � you might need to recover a shipwreck, research the Kraken's behavior, or get devoured by the Kraken and cut your way out from the inside! When you complete an objective, you earn the reward on the back side! On your turn, take two actions: Move your character one space and activate the space you land on Play a Salvage card Use a Character Ability Discard two matching Salvage cards to recover a diver or Character ability You'll need to carefully plan with your teammates to combine your Salvage and Character abilities to accomplish objectives, because at the end of each turn, you'll reveal a Kraken card, which will move the Kraken's head and the tentacles on the board. Easy and Intuitive Kraken AI: The top section of each Kraken card moves its head, and the bottom section moves the tentacles in the three columns of the board directly in front of the head. If the Kraken's tentacles reach your starting area, you'll gain Threat - which can make you lose the game. When you eliminate tentacles, you'll earn valuable Salvage cards which will help you accomplish your goals: Built from the Ground Up for Solo: At every step of the way � cooperative dives were designed with solo in mind. All objectives work as a solo diver, and the Kraken AI already provides a powerful and flexible framework for a solo opponent: The Refuge: Terror from the Deep is a standalone sequel to B&B Games Studios' 2016 release The Refuge: a race for survival, and does not require the base game. However, every pledge comes with 18 Kickstarter Exclusive Crossover Character cards for players who own both games! These introduce all new character roles for the 6 player minis in The Refuge: a Race for Survival, and for players who have both Terror from the Deep and Race for Survival, allow you to use the zombie-killing survivors as characters in the competitive dive of Terror from the Deep.

This new postpartum tool guides you through creating a postpartum plan and easily connects it with your network of trusted family and friends that can be there to lend a helping hand�all with the push of a button from your phone or computer. It also provides postpartum education to both you and your chosen helpers/support team to inform all involved in your experience. Whether it�s a helpful meal delivered, an hour or two of childcare for a desperately needed nap or walk around the block, a request for an adult conversation, and everything in between, Aida pushes out calls for a little assistance to your support network. The person from that group who can help easily accepts that call. It�s really that simple. Aida is for parents and parents-to-be who want to take charge of their postpartum experience by creating a postpartum plan with the support from their friends and family. Asking for help shouldn't be hard. With Aida, we�re taking back the term postpartum�changing it from one of depression, isolation, or �getting back to your old self� to one of strength, support, and togetherness. Picture this: the entire day has been spent feeding, changing, and bouncing an amazing but why won�t this little thing sleep baby, all while keeping up with a toddler who can�t be left out of sight. The clock says it�s 1:00PM. Food? Nope. What is a glass of water? What is that smell? Help is needed, but who is even available and what would the ask even be? It�s all overwhelming and too much trouble to figure out who can help so it�s easier to go at it alone. Sound familiar? We�ve been there, and it�s a hard place to be. Now, let�s paint a new picture, with Aida. The day will start the same (sorry), but thankfully you created a plan for postpartum with Aida. Meals, togetherness, or extra hands�get help when you need it. With a push of a button, Aida sends out the call to your network of chosen family and friends who are ready to meet your needs. They accept the call and are ready to lend a hand. A shower, shoulder to lean on, and warm tea. You are charged physically and emotionally for the rest of the day. Sweet relief. Cris is a mother, parenting two spirited boys with her steadfast husband. Her own struggle in postpartum inspired her to become a doula. She aspires to connect with fellow humans and support them as they navigate pregnancy, birth, and the messy, joyful journey into parenthood. TGW Studio is a social impact marketing and creative studio that partners with forward-thinking businesses and individuals to tell their stories and breathe life into ideas. As parents themselves with similar blindsiding experiences into parenthood and the desire to spark change in that arena, it was a natural fit to team up with Cris to bring Aida to life."

In the beginning, there was tons of testing with various knee pad solutions and dozens of different types of fabric and materials. With years of trial and error, the knee pads evolved into using her husband�s biking arm sleeve warmers, silicon, and shoo goo. After 6 years of extensive research and progression, it has led her to create the first of its kind, an all day wearing, flexible, durable, tear resistant knee pad. By using a sneaker sole material on the knee, they can last far longer than any other knee pad out there withstanding wear on cement, asphalt, rock, you name it. First created out of a need to promote independence for people with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy, hypotonia, and hemophilia. Now after some testing, the Skneeks go beyond just special needs. They are being used by rock and wall climbers and have potential for so much more. There is a need for a multi-sport tear resistant kneepad. - video with subtitles here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxzgz9RUJ70&t=8s .....

We are teaming up with others to help in this journey giving people the ability to live life to the fullest as everyone deserves the ability to enjoy every day recreation and to Liiv! After testing all types of knee pads, hard shell, volleyball, and other various knee protection, even sweat bands, not one would work in the way we needed it to. They would either tear, too hard, too short, can�t walk/crawl in comfortably, didn�t stay in place, and just not meant for all day use and for constant impact on hard surfaces.

Any funds raised above the goal will go into a larger order, as well as future pin designs that will be able to come out sooner with your help. Whichever pin designs get unlocked will get produced. ***Pin Description*** Approx 1.5 Inches Black Nickel Plated Dual Post (to prevent spinning) Hard Enamel (Color and details may vary slightly from production) Once the campaign is over and all the Kickstarter rewards have been sent out to backers, any leftover pins will be available for purchase in my online shop.

PLUS, pledging through this campaign gives you the pins at a DISCOUNTED PRICE! Backers will choose their pins from the funded designs through a survey at the end of the campaign. Surveys will be sent out after the campaign ends. New to Kickstarter? For any of you that are not familiar with Kickstarter or how crowdfunding works, it is pretty simple. There is a funding period for a project (on average, it's 30 days). If the project reaches or surpasses its goal before these 30 days, great! If the project reaches 30 days and doesn't reach its goal, the project is unsuccessful, anyone who backed the project will not get charged anything, no one will receive any rewards. If the project is successful, at the end of the funding period, Kickstarter sends out surveys to backers and collects the funds that everyone has pledged. (Please keep in mind that the money you pledge is not taken from you the moment you decide to support this Kickstarter campaign. You are only charged if the campaign is successful.) To avoid shipping delays, everyone who backed the project should return their survey with their correct address and any other needed information as quickly as possible. ***TIMELINE*** Mid June (Start) - Kickstarter launched Early July - Kickstarter campaign ends and surveys are emailed to during that week. This will tell me what items you want. Mid July - 2 weeks after the campaign the funds are released and I will submit pins into production! Production should be roughly 3-4 weeks from the manufacture. Late July - If everything runs smoothly I should have the pins in hand for inspection. Please allow me time to inspect and hand pack your orders! Early August - You should received your orders by mail within 3-5 days (depending on where you are in the world. From my experience it International Orders will take longer! About 2-3 weeks) ***Cost Breakdown*** Pin Production: 70% Shipping & Packaging: 20% Kickstarter Fees: 10%"

Heroes are made there, and people die. In December, when the Pipeline Masters are held, and the waves can hit twenty feet, the best professional surfers on the planet are concentrated in a handful of beachfront rentals within a few hundred yards of each other. These houses are the closest thing to an actual backstage that exists on the North Shore. This is where surfing�s elite convene. But don�t expect to jump off a tour bus with your suntan lotion & fanny pack and get to truly experience the North Shore. This is the birthplace of modern surfing, but much of the real action is off limits to the general public. The North Shore is an extremely tight-knit community that is largely inaccessible to most visitors. This book is an intimate behind-the-scenes tour of the North Shore shot with remarkable access and from a perspective rarely seen by outsiders. HI 1K features an astounding 1000 candid photos, portraits and interviews shot over the course of 10 seasons. The rich backstories of these moments are illuminated with dozens of detailed and evocative captions. HI 1K is a lush and voyeuristic journey chronicling the private lives and unguarded moments of the larger-than-life characters that make up the surf culture of the North Shore. Why Kickstarter? We�re incredibly excited to announce the pre-sale campaign for HI 1K � 10 years, 1000 moments on the North Shore of Hawaii. The creative team at Indoek have an amazing track record of creating beautifully designed book projects that remain true to the aesthetic and tone of the images and content inside. Last year they produced and designed the critically acclaimed �Surf Shacks� book. For this project, we�ve spent countless hours curating and editing thousands of photos from 10 years worth of material. We�ve researched paper stocks, sourced an amazing offset printer, and assembled 244 page layouts that bring the saltwater, grit, excitement and splendor of the North Shore to life. We are passionately committed to creating the most meticulously-designed book and using the highest quality printing methods and materials. This process is not cheap, but this book was too important for us to cut corners, or to concede control by handing it over to an outside publisher. Instead, we opted to produce and fund this book by offering it directly to a community that recognizes the value of this material and trusts our commitment to quality. This project has been a massive undertaking, but we�re incredible proud of what we�ve put together. Now we just need your support to help us get over the finish line. PRINTING DETAILS HI 1K will be a stunning hardcover book available to the general pubic in fall 2019. Kickstarter backers will receive first edition copies at a significantly discounted price before they are released to the public. Unfortunately we can't ship pre-sale copies of HI 1K internationally due to the high shipping costs and the associated fees charged by Kickstarter. Please check back in fall 2019 - We will be offering HI 1K for worldwide sales! The book specs are as follows: 244 Pages. 4 Color Offset printing with spot varnish. Case bound, hardcover with fabric wrap and foil stamp. Embossed cover image. 157 GSM Matte Art Paper. 9.5"" X 11.5"" HI 1K Page Layouts and Captions Examples ""Greyson skated up to the Banzai Skatepark with two Coors tallboys, took a long swig, and then dropped in wearing flip flops. His casual flow and perfect style is mesmerizing to watch. He is the undeniable star of the park. But rather than monopolizing time and taking more runs than others, I actually found myself wanting to see him skate more. Instead, he seemed to relish in the social aspect of the scene. I watched him roam from corner to corner of the park cracking jokes, laughing, and talking to groms and girls like a celebrity working the room of a Hollywood restaurant. After finishing his Coors, he wiped his sun-bleached, overgrown beard, and cracked open another. He stood quizzically, and with his movie star smile he wondered out loud to nobody in particular why more people weren�t drinking beer. It was as if we all were at his private party and he was genuinely concerned that some guests might not be having enough fun. Everybody certainly was."" ""I'd been commissioned to shoot the legendary surfer Bruce Irons for an ad campaign. I knew that I wanted to do an underwater portrait, but I felt that it was very important that we had a controlled environment to work in. I decided to shoot it in his pool. Thankfully, the waves were flat on the island that day, so I had Bruce's undivided attention... sort of. We met him at his house and I started by taking some portraits of him around the property. I kept attempting to get him into the pool, but there always seemed to be something that would distract his attention. I eventually got him to put on board shorts and he approached the water. Just as I thought we were finally going to start shooting, Bruce suddenly became obsessed with trying to figure out why his remote-controlled audio system wasn't working. I watched patiently as the sunlight began to fade. I ultimately got him into the water, but I wasn't getting anything spectacular. We came up with the concept of trying to shoot him blowing ""vortex bubbles"". Neither one of us knew how to go about making them. With wet hands, I frantically attempted to search for some info on my phone. It was approaching late afternoon and we were losing daylight fast. After about 60 seconds, I happened to look over and see Bruce sitting by himself cross-legged at the bottom of the pool nonchalantly blowing a flawless stream of bubbles. I jumped in the pool and began shooting. I had a water-housing, but no mask, so I was virtually blind under water. I estimated the framing of Bruce as best as I could, then I panned the camera and fired multiple shots left to right and up and down hoping to capture the appropriate cropping. After about three or four attempts, we nailed the perfect shot. I got out of the pool and reveled in the epic picture that we had just captured. I asked Bruce how he managed to figure out the bubble technique. He declared mysteriously, ""It's simple.... it's how dolphins do it"". Bruce later gave me a long cryptic speech about how ""...basically, the entire universe is nothing but vortexes."" ""Mark Cunningham is a North Shore lifeguard and a pioneer of the sport of bodysurfing. He is a true Hawaiian waterman, and he has a very intimate relationship with the sea. Bodysurfing doesn't involve a lot of equipment - it is wave riding in it's purest form. Before he swam out into the ocean this day, I saw him pause at the water's edge, stare into the horizon, and have a quiet reflective moment. It was just him and the sea. He's witnessed the energy of these waves take human lives. He's also had countless hours of pleasure as a result of their power. As I stood there watching him, his vast respect and love for this insurmountable force was palpable"" ""The day was riddled with controversial scores. Kelly Slater and John John Florence both put a on a brave face and gave the obligatory interviews to the hungry press. It was an epic battle that played out like a Shakespearean play. The young prince didn't quite usurp the King, but John John did have the consolation of the Triple Crown trophy and the knowledge that during his matchup against World Champion Mick Fanning, he had masterfully put the Champ in a combo position within minutes of the start of their heat. Kelly Slater earned himself another prestigious Pipe Masters title. They both surfed magnificently that day... but their their awe-inspiring accomplishments were tainted with the bitter irony that Kelly had desperately wanted another world title, and John John had lusted for the elusive Pipe title. Despite their magnificent victories, they both were horribly disappointed. At dusk, I spotted the 11 time World Champ walking solemnly down the bike path. Alone. The number 2 on the back of his jersey resonated poignantly in my mind as I watched Kelly make the 5 minute trek towards his home - sans entourage or fanfare."" The Surfer Poll is the one time of year where the top surfers in the world gather to wear skirts too small and suits too large. But then again, judging surfers on their fashion sensibilities is as pointless as trying to critique Cara Delevingne on her barrel-riding skills. People have designated lanes. The attendees that chose to keep it simple with a modest black dress or a button down shirt with closed toed shoes tended to pull it off best. JJF�s well-tailored blue suit was the exception that proved the rule, while Mason Ho made the sensible choice of a Hawaiian shirt and black pants. Classic look. Although these two Hawaiian locals have very different personalities, they share at least one thing in common. They are both universally revered on the North Shore. John is the humble heir apparent and Mason is the loveable wisecracking prince. Both of them have the upmost respect for their surfing elders and the DNA of the sport. Mason loves to get loose, but he also knows just where to draw the line. Shortly after this picture, he had to politely reign in his right hand man Burger�s rowdy backstage antics. �Just because we won this award, doesn�t mean that they won�t kick us out, Burger!� ""Pipeline is not only one of the most dangerous waves on the planet, it is also one of the most crowded. All of the top rated surfers on the pro-tour as well as a handfull of local wildcards compete in the prestigious Pipe Masters contest every December. Just being a competitor is a huge honor, but being in the Pipe Masters event also provides another invaluable opportunity - the chance to surf this legendary break with only a few other surfers in the lineup. The break is closed to the public during the contest, but the moment after the final heat is completed, the lineup is once again teeming with dozens of surfers.

Hello! My name is Melissa and I am the artist/owner behind Mimosa Studio, and this will be my third Kickstarter Project. These will all be black nickel plated, hard enamel, with a single pin post and rubber clutch. They will all have the same body size of approximately 5/8"". The ears will make some closer to 3/4"" in total height. The initial 7 pins are using the same mini snowmen molds from my previous Kickstarter, but with more traditional coloring instead of solid white. At the end of the campaign, I will send out a survey for you to select which pin(s) you wanted. Pin Grading Pin grading varies from maker to maker, but there are typically three categories: Standard Grade (Nearly Perfect), B-Grade (Minor Defects), and Seconds (Major Defects). Most pins will have very minor defects in them, as it's almost impossible to have a truly ""perfect"" pin, which is very subjective from eye to eye anyway. Backers will receive standard grade pins, which means any flaws will be subtle, if noticeable at all. Costs The initial cost of the entire project is low, as the molds for the original seven are already made. With the funds that I have already placed aside for this project, I only need $500 more for the main goal. The stretch goals are spaced a bit further apart, to help cover the production costs of the new designs, as well as cover the freebies that will be included in select tiers. Timeline If successfully funded, charges will begin on July 13th, so please plan accordingly. There may be a delay due to it being the weekend, but it's better to anticipate the earlier date. It will take up to 3 weeks for payments to be cleared before I can pay the manufacturer, hopefully around August 2. From there, it takes an additional 4-6 weeks for production, so I hope to have these in hand around September 13th. I plan to have all of these shipped by the end of September, but this is also based on the number of backers. If there are more than I anticipate, then it could overflow into October, but I will work as quickly as I can. Goals UNLOCKED! My first stretch goal is to have all ten of these designs printed on a 3.5x5"" sticker sheet, which will unlock at $1000. This will be produced by an outside party. UNLOCKED! My second stretch goal, newly updated to $1400 (was $1600) will be to have the mouse mini pin FREE for tiers B, C, D, E, and the two early bird tiers (all 3+ pin tiers except for the B-Grade and Minor defects tiers). UNLOCKED! My third stretch goal, newly updated to $1800 (was $2200), will be to have the panda mini FREE for tiers C, D, E, and the two early bird tiers (all 5+ pin tiers except for the B-Grade and Minor defects tiers). My fourth stretch goal, newly updated to $2200 (was $3000), will be to have the red panda mini pin FREE for tiers D, E, and the two early bird tiers (all 7+ pin tiers except for the B-Grade and Minor defects tiers). My fifth stretch goal will unlock at $2400, in which the washi tape will be free for all tiers! My sixth stretch goal will unlock at $2600, in which the mini cow pin will be free for all tiers! Updates The sticker sheet has now been updated to include the cow! The cow mini pin will now be on the survey and can be pledged for. I am doing both a brown and black cow, as well as glitter variants of them. I've also added a Fall Friends washi tape! These will be a $4 add-on ($6 each after the campaign ends). If we hit $2400, it will be free for all tiers!"

Gunsho's Goetia is an ongoing series of 72 illustrations of the demons of the Goetia. Each demon is produced as a limited edition 5-color screen print. I've been working on and off on my Goetia series for a decade. Though artistically rewarding, the costs of producing each print makes tends to put the series on the back burner. I've produced 29 prints so far and I've got a lot more to go before I finish 72. Money for materials and labor has been an obvious obstacle. Each illustration takes time to draw, color, and then print by myself. It's a costly endeavor. I'm hoping to remedy that by raising funds to produce one print at a time until I'm finished with the series. By contributing to this, you'll make it more possible to continue this series and bring it to light. Thank you."

We believe it takes a village to raise a healthy child, and the Share Fairies diverse village of characters are here to support you. Share Fairies is the passion project of a sister-duo, Stefani and Amy, who are both moms to small children. We know how difficult milestones in learning and developmental transitions can be for children and parents, and we created the Share Fairies to ease these challenges. Our initial goal is to publish the first of a series of Share Fairies children�s books. This first book will empower children ��to donate and share their baby/toddler items when developmentally ready to take the next step. ""We're the Share Fairies and we love to share! The big kids give, and it shows they care. When the babies receive, they giggle and coo. Thank you for sharing; we appreciate you!"" Problem: ""My child simply will not give up her binky/pacifier. She panics when it rolls under the couch and I carry around three extras in the diaper bag just in case. Is there a stress-free way that my child will volunteer to give up her binky?"" Solution: Share Fairies! Problem: ""Potty training has been so difficult! Even though my child is capable of being diaper-free, he simply will not let go of his diapers. Is there a stress-free way that my child will volunteer to give up diapers for a big-kid potty?"" Solution: Share Fairies! Problem: ""My child's play room and bedroom are filled with old toys. She refuses to give them away, but Santa is coming next week and we simply cannot fit any more toys in these spaces. Is there a stress-free way that my child will volunteer to donate her toys?"" Solution: Share Fairies! Our Story When Stefani�s daughter Kate was two years old, she took Kate to the dentist for a checkup. It turned out that Kate�s teeth had been moving in all of the wrong ways due to her beloved binky, and it was time to ""take it away."" As Stefani and her wife geared up to cut off the tip or simply ""lose"" every single binky Kate owned, it occurred to them that it would be much more palatable if Kate made the choice to give them up on her own. Stefani found several pacifier/binky fairy books on Amazon but was disappointed that all the books she reviewed were either gender-specific or limited to use with pacifiers. Having two young kids of her own, both of whom cherished their binkies, Amy also became interested in finding a better way to help her children part ways with their precious baby items. Thus, the idea for Share Fairies was born! We provided Kate with a special Share Fairies box (parents provide a receptacle), gave her time to personalize the box by coloring and decorating the outside, and, right before bed, we read/sang our new Share Fairies book! To our surprise, it worked! Kate voluntarily rounded up every single binky and placed them in the box all by herself. She said goodbye and crawled right into bed! In the following days, Kate referenced the Share Fairies several times in terms of where her binkies had gone, and she was happy to have donated. Needless to say, our donation journey had begun! Six months later, Kate�s cousin Reese was visited by the Share Fairies and waved goodbye to her binkies with no tears shed! Our first Share Fairies book is a fourteen stanza, rhyming song (read a sample of the story below) about the Share Fairies needing your child's help to donate items to the babies who really need them. When the Share Fairies retrieve items during the night, they may leave a special Thank-You note or a small token (stickers, toothbrush, a book) of their appreciation in the box. We decided to further test the theory that our idea could work with other children, so we asked our friends and family with children to test it out. We sent the story out and measured the results! 5/5 other children have jumped on the Share Fairies bandwagon and have successfully given up binkies, bottles, diapers, and toys! Since we introduced the Share Fairies into our family, our children have also successfully donated their bottles, diapers, pull-ups, old toys, and training toilet to the younger children who need them! SAMPLE STANZAS: Deep in the Land of Sharing, magical creatures lurk, Share Fairies work while they toil, hard at work. Singing joyous songs and spreading shareful cheer, To the big kids (like you) who are big enough to hear. �We�re the Share Fairies and we love to share. The big kids give, and it shows they care. When the babies receive, they giggle and coo. It�s time to share. We are waiting for you!� When it is time to choose a box, you know what to do. You�re a big kid now. Share toys you don�t use. Share those diapers and the bottles. Spit that binky out! Get ready! Get set! Let�s hear you shout! What makes Share Fairies Unique? The Share Fairies is a different concept than any other product or publication on the market because we take a holistic approach to empowering children to share. Not only will we publish our first book to empower kids to let go of their beloved baby items; our vision is to expand the Share Fairies brand to sharing in all facets of life by publishing many more books in our series and by creating a robust website, blog, and set of resources parents can access for support. We envision supporting childhood social emotional learning and academic endeavors by catering to children and by providing parallel resources to parents and guardians. The Share Fairies access a child�s sense of wonder, sparking imagination and creativity unlike other products or publications. The Share Fairies believe in diversity, inclusion, and gender neutrality. The artwork we envision for our fairies and the Land of Sharing showcases a plethora of diverse personalities, colors, shapes, sizes, abilities, and cultures. Boys and girls alike will identify with our fairies, which will more closely reflect an intentional artistic approach in diversity of character rather than the traditional vision of a petite, pink fairy. Other ideas to incorporate engaging elements include creating a Share Fairies tracker to be accessed on our website so kids can track the location of the Share Fairies who are on the way to their homes (comparable to a Santa tracker), and to have the text of each book recorded as a song to be accessed through the website. The audio element is a fun way to read the story with a child, while also supporting early childhood literacy by allowing kids to read the book independently with support from the song. Sample Future Books: Share Fairies: Feelings are Meant to be Shared (Sharing feelings) Share Fairies: Friends Share (Sharing with others) Share Fairies: The Season of Sharing (Holiday edition) Share Fairies: The Kind of Human I Want To Be (Sharing kindness) Share Fairies: Sharing Cultures (Celebrating diversity) Share Fairies: Share the Wealth (An introduction to financial literacy and social responsibility) Share Fairies: Sharing Responsibility (Taking responsibility) The Budget The book will be a fully illustrated hardcover, 8x10 inches and 20 pages. We will also publish an eBook in EPUB/PDF format. Your donation in support of Share Fairies will contribute to: 1. Illustration & Book Design Fees: Working with a local artist! 2. Publishing Expenses 3. Administrative Fees: website, shipping fees, ISBN creation, etc. 4. Kickstarter Fees (8% - 10%) Aspiration: Professional vocal artist to perform the Share Fairies song. Please note that the estimated delivery date in the Rewards section is January 2020. Our goal is to deliver prior to Christmas 2019, but we are building in time during production for any adjustments that may need to be honored. Thank you.

Each Brief is made of 100% certified organic pima cotton - a naturally hypoallergenic, silky smooth fabric that's 100% free of toxins, synthetics and pesticides. And because studies show we should replace our everyday underwear once a year to stay healthy, we take the guesswork out of knowing when it's time to refresh your underwear drawer. Each pair comes with a unique D.O.B. to help keep track. Stick with us, and never worry about underwear shopping again. Take our Quick Fit Quiz� to find briefs perfect for your bum > The Annual Brief comes in 3 styles.... And 2 colors... MIX AND MATCH colors and styles within all pledge levels.

Designed for Everyday: lightweight fabric to wear running, jogging, walking, working, brunch-ing and everything in-between. Machine Washable: pop them in the wash with like colors, tumble dry or line dry and voila! Made in Los Angeles: with our family-owned factory. Stamped with Unique D.O.B.: because studies show we should replace everyday underwear annually, each Annual Brief comes with a discreetly stamped 'Date of Birth' to help keep track. Landfill Free: each Annual Brief shipment comes with a Recycle Club pouch, to send back pairs that are past their prime to our recycling partner for refinement and repurposing (i.e. in insulation) to divert waste from landfill. Auto-Refresh Guarantee: our annual subscription program keeps track of when it may be time to swap out your old pairs for new, so you don't have to.

Recorded in remote forested hideouts, off-kilter compositions of harp, layered strings, pump organ, found sounds, and crystal glass explore the versatility of queer love and survival. Written during songwriter Elliott Miskovicz�s passage to living in the woods due to neurological conditions after a lifetime in the Philadelphia area, these 11 songs follow the journey of the sacrifices we make in the name of solace. Although rural life was not always easy as a trans fag, his songwriting there evolved from a tool for coping with chaos into an expression of reverence for the enduring ecosystems surrounding him. Mixed by Candlewolfe sound and currently being mastered by Kris Force, Versatile's physical release will include 11 handmade drawings of plants corresponding to each song by herbalist Miranda Resnick, and an evocative cover poster by queer metal artist Stephen Wilson.

From the waterproof 25L capacity and 30D ripstop material to the anti-theft pockets and �Brain� pouch on the top, you just found your new favorite go-to pack. The minimal look hides the functional pockets, which are right where they should be in a pack. When packed down, it stays incognito so you are ready to go on your day adventures. Have you ever tried a packable daypack only to find that it is basically just a cheap sack of material? Or maybe you have been bringing your high quality backpack with you on all your trips and travels? The Uinta Daypack brings you a high quality feature heavy backpack in the palm of your hand! Key Features Packs Down to the Size of Your Hand 30D Ripstop Material Water Resistant With DWR Coating 25 L Capacity Anti-theft Pockets Strategically Placed Against Your Back. Hydration Bladder Compatible All Zippers Sealed All Zippers YKK Ultra Lightweight (Only 14 oz) Cargo Strap For Extra Storage Roll Top For Water Seal G-hook Reflective Front Zippers For Visibility Brain Pouch Adjustable Sternum Strap DSLR Camera Quick Access 25L Capacity The daypack fits into your pocket to be stowed away, yet it can be filled with all of your gear for a day trip. This is enough for your typical gear setup like water bottles, food, extra clothes, cameras, phone, and other everyday carry gear. 25 Liters is like 40 apples, 400 golf balls, or 6000 marbles, for those of us who measure things that way. The pockets on the outside are great for extra gear and a cargo strap for carrying large items like a jacket, tripod, or a skateboard. The main pocket also is large enough for up to 18"" laptops! Packable The daypack packs into it's own zippered pocket so there's no stuff sack to lose! This is one of the defining characteristics of the daypack. It packs down into it's own pocket to be stowed out of the way until it is needed. It can easily fit inside any travel bag ready to be used on those days walking around Machu Picchu or exploring the Neuschwanstein castle. The pack fits into its own pocket so there is no stuff sack to lose! Water Resistant Hopefully you never get rained on this much, but if you are, we've got you covered! All Zippers are Sealed, All are YKK The inside of the pack will keep your stuff confidently dry with a DWR coated 30D Nylon Ripstop. Who wants to open a pack to find a wet camera or have to eat a soggy sandwich? Not us. The outside pockets also have sealed zippers, and will keep things dry from rain or water splashing. Anti-Theft Keep your gear secure where you know it can't be accessed by anyone but you. Secure pockets give you the confidence of keeping your gear protected, yet its easily accessed by only you. The main pocket is for your laptop or tablet, with a smaller pocket for your phone, passport, or wallet. This pocket gives easy access to take a quick shot, respond to a message, or pay for something. The anti-theft pockets cannot be reached by anyone without swinging the pack to your side, which allows for easy access of your valuables. Keep your valuables hidden and touching your back, where you can feel that they are secure. Nobody has access to the pockets against your back except for you. Gear Access That Makes Sense The Roll Top lets you easily take gear in and out. Quick access through the side vertical zipper (sealed). The roll top opens wide for easy stuffing of your pack with all your gear, while the sealed side zipper allows for easy access without having to open the top again. It's the best of both worlds! Premium, Low Profile Materials Only the highest quality materials are used for the daypack. The main fabric is an incredibly strong 30D Nylon Ripstop, with a DWR water resistant coating. This will keep water out, scratches off, and will last a long time. Every zipper is water sealed and are the industry leading YKK with a soft grip TPU molded zipper pull. All of these have been field tested to last the test of rugged conditions. We have also decided to change the logo to black due to popular demand! We will be getting a mock up of what it will look like soon but in the meantime use your vivid imagination to picture the logo black (shouldn't be too hard). The Straps and Adjusters The shoulder straps on this pack are as wide as a standard backpack (2"") and have a light padding to provide comfort while still being lightweight. The mesh on the underside of the shoulder straps gives a cool and lightweight feeling, while still keeping their strength from the reinforcements designed in along the sides. The shoulder straps are extra long so every body type can wear the pack comfortably. Shoulder Strap (Left) has a soft mesh on the outside with padding on the inside. Sternum strap (right) can adjust up and down and open wider. Sternum straps should stand the test of time, that's what we believe. The sternum strap is super robust and has a light stretchy section so it is extra comfy. It can be adjusted up, down, and wide to fit every person's body type. The strap dimensions are: 18"" (45cm) length padded section + 24"" (60cm) adjustable nylon strap length, so the total usable strap length is 42"" (107cm). Water Bladder Compatible The Uinta Daypack has an integrated water bladder system that is perfect for hiking or those long days to always keep you hydrated. The hose routing makes sense without having to leave a zipper cracked open. There is a seperate compartment just for a hydration bladder that does not open to the main compartment. The hose can be pushed through the hole and around to the shoulder strap for quick access where you need it. Most 2L Hydration packs will fit into the custom designed pocket. Perfect Complementary products (Designed to fit together) Perfect Hydration Bladder (2L) This is not your typical hydration bladder. It is packed with our favorite features such as pop-proof TPU material that is seriously tough, the bladder mouth that completely opens to turn it inside out to clean it, and a quick release mechanism for the hose. It is dishwasher safe, leak-proof, and has a pop-up bite valve that lets out just the right amount of fluid when biting. All of the features are super durable and made from the highest quality materials. Would you do this to your old blue hydration pack? Didn't think so. This one can take the abuse. Washable! Turn it inside out and throw it in the dishwasher! Have you ever made the worst mistake ever and left liquid in your old water bladder or even worse put Gatorade in it? If you are like us, you have, and you will never forget how horrible it was to clean out the bladder. We think time is better spent doing anything else in the world, so you can easily clean this bladder by turning it completely inside out and putting it in the dishwasher! Compression Packing Cubes Compress these indestructible cubes down by 30%. If you've never experienced the joy of traveling with packing cubes, prepare yourself to regret never having them before... This set of three cubes compress down your stuff to carry the lowest possible volume. They are made with a super strong, yet lightweight 410D Nylon Ripstop and YKK zippers. The compression zipper brings the volume down by about 30% to make packing your gear efficient and dense. The cubes open all the way so they can be used right in drawers without having to unpack and repack when you are done. All these features fit into a super small package that weighs next to nothing. This is what the kit includes Kit Includes: 2L Compression Cube: Perfect for electronics or small personal items. 4L Compression Cube: Just the right size for undies and Tees. 10L Compression Cube: This is the big boy that keeps all your pants, shirts, and maybe your travel companion's too! Featured on: When will it all ship? Design Process Project birth and development: The project was born from a 10 day trip in Europe where I brought both a large duffel and a standard backpack, which didn't make a lot of sense to me. I wore the duffel on my back and the backpack on my front, which made me feel like a Bull in a china shop wherever I went. I could have fit all my gear into my large duffel except that my daypack didn't fit well, so I was forced to carry it outside like a dope. The problem distracted from the amazing places we visited. When I got back I looked at the available options only to find packs that were too simple, too small, or too expensive. The gears in my head started turning and I started researching to find and solve the problems found in packable daypacks available on the market. Here I am thinking about an easier way to do things: Walking around like this even for a little while is frustrating and makes you vulnerable to pickpocketers. Customers were surveyed, the pack was scrutinized, field tested, iterated on, and finally we captured the design with only the best features. The included features hone in on the most important uses of a day pack, and cut out the rest. The minimal design is very functional, yet does not add unnecessary complexity that can clutter the use and ad failure points. Early survey data, Sketches, and first prototype iterations. Refunds/Returns? We only use premium materials and offer a one year warranty. We will repair or replace any product that somehow don't hold up to do what it was designed to be used for.

After years of getting requests to add a clip to our Original Machine Era Pen, we�ve finally come up with a solution worthy of this well-known design. Originally released in 2015, the Machine Era Original Brass quickly became our most popular item. Although we don�t know exactly how many we�ve made. It�s been featured on almost every gear blog, Multiple collaborations, EDC review channels, and rose to #1 brass pen on Amazon�s Choice. We�ve decided to clean up some lines, dial in some finishing work, add a 3D machined pocket to hold the well made (in USA) extra flexible clip in place, and actually laser engrave our logo so you know it�s the real deal- It�s inspired quite a few copies. Adding a 3D machined clip holding pocket doubles production time, but securely holds the made in USA extra flexible spring steel clip- no spinning, scratching the body, or coming loose. The Machine Era Markup comes pre-loaded with a felt tip Fineliner by Schmidt. We fell in love with this new ink, and thought it worked perfectly with this design. But don�t worry, if that�s not your thing, it still fits standard Pilot g2 cartridges (also included). The internals are the same as our Original. 100% machined. No springs or any other moving parts. Machine Era | Markup in Solid Brass Machine Era | Markup in Stainless Machine Era | Markup in Black DLC Simple. Utilitarian. Solid in hand feel. Fineliner ink The 1.0mm Schmidt 6040 Fineliner is a Reservoir based refill with a spring loaded felt tip. For those of you who aren't familiar with fineliners- it writes like well flowing (non-permanent) marker. Hand Polished Stainless Steel Features & Specs: Machined clip pocket Zero tip play Postable cap threads on body Balanced weight Compact size No springs or mechanisms Weight- 1.6oz Length (capped)- 4.6 inches Length (open)- 4.3 inches Diameter- 0.40 inches Fits Standard Pilot G2 refills (included) Pre-loaded with a Schmidt Fineliner (included) Finish The Stainless steel version is hand polished to perfection. The Black DLC is blasted to a matte finish and coated with aerospace diamond like carbon. The brass has an incredibly clean off the machine finish that we�ve dialed in after much trial and error over the years. About us and how we operate. As many of you have noticed, we don�t always keep making our products. Although we frequently get requests for gear we�ve discontinued, our main priority is always to keep improving and releasing new designs. Our machine time is limited, and most of what we manufacture isn�t going to be in production forever. So if you like what you see, get it while you can. We 100% always run out of stock. We�re a small two man shop and plan to stay that way. That said, we�re super excited about this project and a few others currently in the works. Stay tuned in. Thanks for your continued support! Be in the know. Keep with us and our latest projects is via instagram: @machineera Machine Era Shop | Richmond, Va Wireframe drawing from the prototyping process (2015)."

I enjoy writing and I enjoy having a real life physical book to add to my collection, so I thought I'd give it a go. I collected and refined a good number of my pieces and ""wrote"" a book. It's done, it's cool, I'm stoked! BUT... it's just a document saved to my computer at the moment. I want you to have a real, hands-on, quality book, and the printing isn't cheap. If your keeping up with me at the moment, you know that I'm in school and that clinicals are going to prevent me from working full time until I graduate from school, so there's not a lot of extra change under the couch cushions to try to make this project a reality. That's why I've started this Kickstarter. I'm not looking for a handout here. If you contribute to my goal, I promise you will receive a quality product in the form of a personal treasure! If you've enjoyed any of my writings, I know that you will think this little book is pretty sweet!"

Broadfork & Friends is Employing and Training Women in Farm Skills, Providing Affordable Labor and Coordinated Growing for the Lost Sierra Region To bring local food to the community table, we need to bring everyone around the table. So, we at BFF are working with all the food-adjacent groups already existing, raising our hands to say, ""We smart and strong ladies will come together to break ground and grow food for the community, in the best way possible."" We want to be as non-mechanized as possible, hence the broadfork (a low-till leverage device), empower women to work and coordinate all year (hence Broadfork & Friends Collective) not be discarded in October at the end of the growing season (winter crops projects and fundraising), and pool everyone's efforts and energy to get the best biodynamic community grown yields, year after year. The hard lessons of growing food in the Sierra Nevada Range have been learned by those who went before, mostly men, until recently when women took to the dirt. Most of the farms of prior years are not growing any longer, with the exception of the exceptional, Gary Romano, at Sierra Valley Farms. There is a huge potential and rising awareness in this area, in the heart of Plumas County, for local food production, reimagining the CSA model under a new paradigm, including even the smallest gardens, granting access to gleaning AND year-long work for our local women. We are working on demonstrating a new model of health, entrepreneurship and agro-ecology. With your help we will build our workers and community membership, outfitting our admin and populating and publishing our web forum. If you believe, like us, in the power of food to build community, create experiences and build meaningful relationships, then we want you to join us to make this a reality. We're willing to put in the work, we just need the support and resources to bring this to life... WHY NOW? There is an itch in the community to grow and eat locally. A lot of things are happening and most of it is happening fast. What is currently happening: The education of children around food production is covered with all the schools housing their own gardens and teachers, and there is a new Eco-Farm Certificate program for aspiring farmers at Feather River College A 2.5 acre plot on private property donated to FRC and County Action Committee under the Lost Sierra Community Food Project, designed by two young women as part of a Master's degree project. The donated food will supply the Seniors, Veterans and School Lunch Programs A group of locals purchased an old dilapidated property with farmable acreage attached to be the local Farmer's Market location after Quincy Natural Foods decided it was too much of an expense. A couple from Idaho is establishing themselves under the name The Funky Beets, growing at what was our local market farm and building out their own CSA, like they did in Idaho, to replace the Five Foot Farm-sized hole left when High Altitude Harvest folded. Sage Eggs & Ham, which provides rare-heritage breed and grass fed and finished pork, is rebuilding her Food Hub/Buyer's Club to flex and grow with the new food producing sprouting out everywhere. There is a lot of energetic forces swirling in the atmosphere looking to fill the vacuum left by our recent slump in local producers, markets and distribution. BROADFORK & Friends aims to be the link to all the information on what is happening, broadening our membership of townsfolk and building out more small gardens and workshops and specialized events to enrich community, and give everyone a chance to have a personal connection to their food, flowers, herbs, remedies and renewing the nutrient cycle. Agriculture, historically, has not been so kind to women. The shift from foraging and kinship societies to a patriarchal, private property system meant women had few rights and were expected to provide the labor force in Ford factory-style. The work involved in gardening and farming is worthwhile, healthful and therapeutic. The act of working together in the soil, planting and harvesting is as nourishing as the eating around a table with friends and family. Why can it not be self-sustaining and beneficial to all involved? Sign up to be part of the Solution, get more info on joining the collaborative @ BFF Form What will we do with the Money? Support development and growth of our Collective: Signage, Advertising and Admin . . . As a start-up we still have the costs of building out a new entity. With our new garden spaces and gatherings being planned we need SIGNS! We need to be able to have a presence and explain our goals to those who see what's happening and want the info. Composting Program . . . Currently all manner of materials gets dumped into the waste transfer station in East Quincy. In the mix is plenty of food waste. There is not a lot of positive publicity around the practice of separating and processing food into working compost. We will be building compost bins, making bike trailers for the pick-up of full buckets and leaving new clean buckets, also buying the buckets and branding them with the BFF logo and instructions on what goes in the bucket. WELLNESS ""Gathering"" GARDENS . . . Currently we have spaces in line to develop into raised bed gardens. UPDATE!! We were given access to a source of old garden beds, set on concrete and full of fallow soils. We are placing those in our partner sites and preparing the irrigation, planting and planning. All the sites will also be assessed for appropriate composting systems and suitable irrigation. We aim to share the healing component of growing food, flowers and herbs; from handling the soil, to the social gathering of people around planting, maintaining & harvesting, all the way up to preparing and enjoying the fruits of our labors. We will offer special access to our members and run demonstrations, events and workshops. Ladies' Mud Wrestling ... Otherwise known as Fundraising and Community Service Every season offers a new opportunity to do something FUN and actually raise FUNDS. We will offer bikini weeding in the hot summer days, also a community stress relief ""SOIL SOCIALS"", and Buche de Noel contest in Winter, and every crazy amusing thing we can come up with: Winter salads, anyone? We also facilitate symposium sessions, in the vein of design charettes bringing together innovative people from the food community creating an dynamic discussion around our local food culture. Our goal is to increase cooperation among are producers, chefs and food processors by creating an improved Local Food culture that will help to define our products, and expand their reach. As with any new venture, there are a lot of unpaid hours and expenses in setting up. Your amazing involvement will allow us to turn this vision into a reality, keep prices fair for workers and affordable for producers and make this a truly local, Broadfork & Friends Collective success! Our most recent sponsored Charette, bringing together everyone with concern for food production, education and distribution. Winter Cropping ... Year-Round growing and fresh greens all winter-long! As part of expanding our reach and improving access to fresh, local food we intend to build cold frames and outfit our garden sites with cold cover and other old-world techniques to keep a garden productive even when the temperature drops. It is so exciting to imagine walking through the snow to harvest your dinner's ingredients. Also, with our canning and preserving workshops we will have stored BFF goodness on all our member's shelves till spring. BFF Facilitated Community Marketplace ... Digital Farmer's Market and YARD to MARKET! We already developed a localized App to share real-time what is available and happening with our Community and Membership. Eventually, we want to also have a physical space, for producers and buyers to exchange for the benefit of all. Our Market Location will provide affordable avenues for our farmers/gardeners to sell their product on a DIY inventory system and get paid monthly or quarterly. In addition to amazing local comestibles, we want to have featured a number of local musicians and artisans, workshops and special events. We're passionate about creating a truly unique, free space, for our community to gather around food. Together we can fund the extras that create a memorable experience, while keeping prices low for our local producers. (See Yard to Market Article, below) Yard to Market Co-op enables backyard gardeners to bring a surplus of eggs or small amounts of produce farmers markets, local grocery stores, and restaurants. The gardener-to-consumer pathway allows customers to talk one-on-one with the producers of the food they're buying. Photo by Scott David Gordon. BFF BRANDING ... Support our local makers, by helping us spread the word. We believe that the BFF brand evokes something special that is worth celebrating. From the sweetest corn, juiciest strawberries to the best summer solstice sunscreen - we want to help distinguish Broadfork & Friends Partner products, and showcase those to the world. Through our local coordinated growing, our Partners receive the best fresh or preserved ingredients to make their finished products. They will be branded to promote the mission and message, and businesses that source our local products will understand the brand, celebrating the effort to employ and empower women and stimulate the local economy. We will also supply a GOOD-BUY list to our members and community of products that we verify as fair to the environment and the workers. Hopefully this list will grow and make it easy to support, allowing you to quickly identify what's a GOOD Purchase! And participating merchants get a window sticker to show their support. FOOD EVENTS! ... As part of Membership we will host special dinners, picnics and breakfast. We want to see more events that involve amazing food and experiences in Plumas County. In partnership with our producers, and our talented citizenry, we are looking to create and host events for the community to connect around food, like the other amazing food cultures we see around the world, historically and new shifts back to the source. We hope to reach outside our locale too, by posting EXCURSIONS thru AIRBNB. WE KNOW THIS CAN WORK ...BECAUSE IT HAS. We all owe a lot to Elizabeth at FIVE FOOT FARM (founded by two 5'2"" farming females) for she put in all the effort and hours and created a produce stand on Saturdays full of the best and freshest goods, and designed a CSA system that work beautifully for the area. Elizabeth mentored many of us and pioneered the best run CSA ""High Altitude Harvest"" in the area, up until last year! BIODYNAMICS ... Along with supplying work and food and education, we also care for the entire system, building bat, bird, and bee friendly spaces and integrating animals back into the Agrarian structure, both wild and domesticated.

Cooperative Principles We need funding to pay for set-up, advertising an actual physical space to meet and a cottage kitchen certification. Once that ball is rolling though, we will be able to make agreements and plans with farms and farmers to add extra hands and orders to the process. We hope to unify everyone under the mission of Learning, Producing, Harvesting and Giving Back.

The TourIt ZOOM Trailer is: A cooler that keeps your food and beverages cold for 24 hours A messenger bag for your everyday belongings A detachable fanny pack for on-the-go activities A bike bag with reflective material and straps to attach to your handle Remember those big and expensive coolers you used to carry when spending time outdoors? The ones that made the whole experience a bit uncomfortable and otherwise were mostly left in your garage to collect dust? And remember those other small coolers that were actually cheap and easy to carry, but you totally gave up on because they simply did not store all you needed to carry nor kept your drinks cold for very long? Awesome; now that you remembered both, feel free to forget all about them! TOURIT is proud to introduce the ZOOM Trailer, the multifunctional cooler/messenger bag. It will ensure your cooler is never forgotten in the garage and no food or beverage is left behind. As a cooler, the ZOOM Trailer is truly unique. It's designed to have huge storage capacity (it can fit 20 cans) while still compact enough for easy carrying. And the best part? It's designed to keep food and beverages cool for up to 24 hours with freeze packs. The ZOOM Trailer is an all-weather soft cooler utility bag that covers all your outdoor needs while meeting FDA requirements for food packaging. What�s more, with the ZOOM Trailer, one bag is all you need! As a messenger bag, you can easily use it to transport your laptop (it comes with a removable pouch to safely carry laptops up to 15.6 inches), documents, chargers, and other small items like granola bars so you can enjoy healthy snacks throughout your day! In fact, the ZOOM Trailer is so convenient as a messenger bag that it features a unique three-strap shoulder system that eases the burden on your shoulders while also allowing you to conveniently keep it to one side of your body. That's why the ZOOM Trailer is more than just a cooler, it's the perfect multifunctional bag for your everyday needs... ... whether you're going to the office in the morning or you're heading to the gym in the afternoon. And as if that weren't enough, we've added even more storage to the ZOOM Trailer. The front pocket is actually a detachable fanny pack that can be used completely separately. Fanny packs have made an official comeback this year with convenient hands-free storage for jogging or exploring a new area without lugging around a giant bag. Because you never know where you�ll need to go or how you�ll need to get there, the ZOOM Trailer even comes with adjustable bicycle cruiser straps that make it ridiculously easy to attach to your bike. Whether for your commuting needs or outdoor recreation, taking this unique bag on your bike is as smart and easy as it gets! The adjustable bike straps aren't the only extra feature increasing capacity and versatility of the ZOOM Trailer. The bag's bottom straps allow you to easily take clothing, towels, and blankets to the beach and on camping and other short trips. The nature-lover in you will be very happy to know that the ZOOM Trailer is an eco-friendly bag. However, its environmentally-friendly nature does not compromise the bag's strength and durability, since the ZOOM Trailer is made with a durable and resistant TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) material, which means the bag can withstand scratching and folding without getting worn out. Did you know? Between 100 and 200 billion pounds of plastic is manufactured annually An estimated 10% of plastic ends up in the oceans every year About 20% comes from ships and platforms in the sea The remaining 80% comes from the land � garbage that travels through storm drains or watersheds and accumulates in streams, rivers, and bays. Eventually, this plastic garbage finds its way into our world's vast oceans. We strive to reduce the environmental burden and provide higher quality materials to our customers, partners and consumers. The ZOOM Trailer has been successfully tested for its FDA & BPA-Free features. Believe it or not, the ZOOM Trailer gets even better: all its zippers are water-repellent! The ZOOM Trailer comes in black, navy, red, green & camo grey, giving you five incredible colors to choose from. With super early bird discounts, you can get one for up to 43% off! Get yours now!

My name is Lil Jimmy Touzel. I've been making records for over two decades, but every album that I've ever made has been as a sideman or producer. I love being a sideman, but I've never made my own record and I think it's time for me to step out into the world and make my very first solo album. I'm really excited to share my talents as frontman with the world, but I need your help to cross the finish line with this project. I've already started recording 4 of the 10 songs to be included on my album at an amazing all-analog studio in Oakland, CA called Owl Sight Recorders. My good friend and audio engineer, Alex Laipeneiks, is handling all the recording and mixing work. The 4 songs that we've already recorded sound really amazing, if I do say so myself! I'm prepared to pay for all of the recording, mixing, mastering, and licensing out of my own pocket. However, I'm launching this kickstarter campaign to cover the cost of manufacturing the vinyl LPs, CDs, and album posters. I've listed a breakdown of the budget below to give y'all a clearer picture of the cost of making an album. Needless to say, its really expensive! Budget breakdown -Recording, Mixing, and Mastering: $2,500 -Vinyl manufacturing: $1,500 -CD manufacturing: $350 -Graphic Design: I'm thrilled that the design company Tiny Crowbar has offered to do this work pro bono. -LP + CD Packaging & Printing: $2,000 *It's super important to me not to cut corners on this step. I want an album cover that's one-of-a-kind and that has a rustic, homemade feeling. I need a custom print shop to complete this step. I'm thrilled to be working with MCL Custom Screenprinters in El Cerrito, CA! -Licensing and Publishing: $1,000 Budget total = $7,350 If I don't hit the $3,888 goal by June 30th, I don't get to keep ANY of the money raised to support this record and your credit card will not be charged. Additionally, as you can see, my total budget of $7,350 is almost twice the amount of my $3,888 campaign goal. If I'm lucky enough to exceed my campaign goal, I have some stretch goals planned to help this album reach a wider audience. My primary stretch goal, should i be so lucky as to exceed my $3,888 goal, is to invest in a music PR specialist to help with the radio campaign and to try and get my album reviewed by media outlets that match my genre and style. What will my debut solo album sound like? This album is gonna sound super-dreamy and minimal. There will be lots of reverb, slapback delay, and tremolo. I won't be using a backing band. I'll just be singing and playing my Fender Bass VI. My repertoire will consist of some of my original songs, a co-write, and some old country and bluegrass tunes that I've reimagined for this album. Will I still be working as a sideman? Absolutely! I will always love working as a sideman. I'll still be playing with the Earl Brothers, Dave Ricketts, the Silver Bell Jazz Band, the Vivants, Blisses B, the Town Howlers, Mitch Polzak and the Royal Deuces, Hank Maninger and the Jukebox Charlies, and Nashville HoneymoonI However, I do plan on taking my solo act on the road and touring in support of this album, so please be on the lookout for me in a town near you.

Aquatella is a 4-stage countertop water filter that eliminates over 99% of all harmful pathogens, heavy metals, pesticides, and chemicals from your drinking water. Tap water is treated with a large number of chemicals to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Plus, even if the source of the water is pure, that water must travel through pipes (sometimes very old pipes) to finally reach your home. These chemicals are routinely added to our water: Aquatella will filter out all those things and purify your water! Keep your water clean and your body healthy! Who�s ready for delicious, clean water? Aquatella comes equipped with the latest nanofiltration filters. It works even with low water pressure and boasts the highest removal rate in its class. Using a micro high-quality sediment filter, this stage removes small particles including dust, dirt, rust, grit, and particles that are 15 times smaller than a grain of sand. Removes Pesticides, Formaldehyde, Chlorine, Heavy Metals, and Odors. The nano-membrane filter is a unique system possessing removal capabilities well beyond the scope of conventional filtration technologies. This stage is capable of removing a wide range of waterborne contaminants including bacteria, macro-molecules, colloids, and micro-sediment. Enhances the fresh taste of water, providing a natural taste by removing dissolved gases and odors through a high quality granular activated bituminous filter. Also removes residual chlorine, pesticides, heavy metals, organic pollutants, and odors. The process of removing fluoride also lightly alkalizes your water (a natural side effect of the fluoride removal process). Enjoy fluoride-free, alkaline water with the Optional Fluoride Filter! Oh and guess what�as a thank you for being a Kickstarter backer, we�re including the Fluoride Filter (Compare at $60 with other filters) for FREE! The Fluoride Filter is an upgrade of the Activated Carbon filter (replaces it) and removes everything the Carbon Filter filters just as well along with fluoride. When we say these filters last, they REALLY Last. Aquatella was built to handle the nastiest tap water. That�s 200x more than a single Brita filter! To put that in perspective, if you drank half a gallon of water a day - you wouldn�t need to replace your filter for almost 44 years! We still recommend changing the filter every year to keep the flow rate high, but in a doomsday scenario, one Aquatella will provide you fresh water for a long time.

Argent Saga Logo Argent Saga is a brand-new trading card game (TCG) from Alter Reality Games (ARG). ARG is known around the world as one of the largest card retail shops and for their Circuit Series of cash tournaments. Alter Reality Games has been in business for over twenty years and as such has seen the rise and fall of innumerable card games. Every time a game unfortunately dies off, we see a community of players left without a place to go. We hate seeing this happen, especially when the reason for a game�s untimely demise is publisher mismanagement. We created Argent Saga to give the power back to the community by engaging with our players on an intimate level. Between our unprecedented level of community involvement and our team�s combined experience of over 100 years in the game business, we aim to avoid the pitfalls of our predecessors and create the next big thing in card gaming. Argent Saga: Trading Card Game is the result of countless hours of playtesting and devotion to one central idea: Let�s make a game that�s fun, easy to pick up, and that can react quickly to player feedback. We�re not a huge company with corporate overlords to please; we started small and have grown because of the community. In many ways, Argent Saga is a love letter to that community. A trading card game by the Community, for the Community Argent Saga was designed by world-renowned Yu-Gi-Oh! player Jeff Jones and Force of Will and Kaijudo champion, Rob Hebert, with art direction by John Kimmel, lore by Ian Spiegel-Blum, and additional assistance from Christopher Medina. Jim McMahan and Brad Hoisington of Alter Reality Games are the masterminds behind the whole project. Jeff Jones, Rob Hebert, Jim McMahan, Brad Hoisington While we�ve got plenty of industry insiders behind the scenes, the game is really the product of a year�s worth of community involvement. Everything from the logo to the colors used on the templates and names for keywords has gone through our dedicated and growing group of Facebook followers. We�ve kept our community in the loop from step one and plan to continue to do so as we grow. Oh, and we plan to grow. Lots.

A Unique Fantasy World The World of Argos Argent Saga takes place on the planet Argos. The planet has six continents, each of varying sizes, four main oceans, strings of islands throughout, incredibly diverse topography and vegetation with many familiar climate-types and a few totally alien. These so-called �alien� climate-types would be unique to earthlings, and could include markers like Light Showers, burning fog, volcanos that erupt snow, places where metal sleets from the sky, and more. Despite having many different continents, countries, and cultures, nearly all of our first set takes place on the continent of Turrim during Age 778. Every 10th spot represents 100 years in Earth time. So, for example, Age 768 would be ten years prior to Age 778. Turrim is twice the size of the United States and broken up loosely into seven unique districts. Each district is defined by a Tower of Power that lies within it. Everything on Turrim revolves around these towers; they provide sustenance to the ground, power to their machines, energy for spellcasting; shards of the towers are used as currency. Control of the towers, therefore, represents control of the continent and, as far as the people on Turrim know, the world. At the beginning of our story, the Turrim people are too far from the other continents to know that they even exist, and as such believe they are the only people on Argos. How could this be, one might wonder? Turrim technology, while advanced, is almost totally reliant on the towers for fuel. Shardlight is the gas for any motor; the further one gets from the source of Shardlight being used, the less a machine works. Go far enough, and your plane could fall out of the sky, your new-fangled motor vehicle stops in its tracks, your horse-body augmentations malfunction. (Horse-body augmentations, such as lasers on horse�s heads, armor, and robotic legs to increase speed, are all the rage in the Scarlet District). The geographical ignorance of the Turrim people could become a troubling point down the road but will not be particularly relevant for us at the beginning. The entire society is based on Shardlight; almost nothing is possible without it, from travel to communication to farming techniques. Because of this, weapons and accessories that may not be relevant in today�s real-world society, like swords, axes, and medieval style cannons, are significantly more useful in Argos when powered up by immense Shardlight. We can also surmise that the culture of Argos plays a large role in which technology has flourished and which hasn�t. Couldthe people of Turrim create airplanes that run on a different energy source to get to another continent? Sure. But why would they? That�s like saying, �Could you create a form of life that doesn�t rely on the sun?� Maybe. But... we have the sun, so there�s not much pressure to do so. Turrim Society As touched on in �The World of Argos� section, the continent of Turrim is roughly broken up into six districts organized geographically around one central Tower. In the center of the continent is the biggest, most powerful of these towers, called The Argent Tower. No district lays claim to this tower; instead, the immediate surrounding city, known as the City of Silver, or just Silver, is a sort of demilitarized zone. In most districts, the people are both effected by the cold war running through society but can live their lives without being majorly affected at all. Within the districts are many unique communities, sub-districts, burroughs, and neighborhoods. Surrounding the districts proper are smaller villages, a few off-the-map shanty towns, mercenary outposts, forts, bases, and lawless riders. The people of Turrim have a mostly capitalistic society with all of the virtues and problems that capitalism brings. There are weaponsmakers, bankers, lawyers, brother owners, bakers, teachers, business people... everything one might expect in a society of people organized by wealth instead of birthright. In the early days, royalty existed in Turrim and some districts even still profess their loyalty to the throne. But this is mostly unimportant and viewed as a novelty by most of Turrim society, a holdover from a more inferior time. Secret societies, too, exist and pull strings behind the scenes. In other words, there is no more aristocracy in Turrim than there is in modern-day America, which is to say, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Society has adjusted to an invisible guillotine over their heads; for generations now, the Frigid War has threatened to break out into open war amongst the districts. If this happens, the very soul of Argos and the future of the Turrim people and the towers will be at stake. Turrim Society is roughly broken into two major groups, each of which follow the Mayor of their district and adhere to a certain vision of the future. These two groups are called The Forge and The Rose. The Forge and the Rose The Forge and The Rose are the two names given to the loose association of districts that exist among ideological lines. The Forge believes that the power of the towers, known as Shardlight, should be used to force society forward. They would use the power to increase their means of production, generate new technology, build new robots, and force the world into a new industrial age in which order and balance reign. They would burn everything down to its roots to forge a new future of their own design. The Rose, on the other hand, believes in freedom. If they adhered to a modern-day American political philosophy, they would be Libertarians. They wear brightly colored clothes, use technology sparingly, and want, more than anything, the freedom to do what they want. They�re a little flowery in dress, many-petaled, and thorny. The Towers and the Districts As discussed previously, Turrim society is based almost entirely on who controls the six Towers of Power. The Towers are living, breathing entities, and are wells of enormous power. They can defend themselves, refuse to let people inside, and choose in a spiritual way who they bestow with their Shardlight � their immense power made portable and used throughout society to channel energy into machines, cast spells, heal, and more. They have long memories, may choose champions to grant power to, and can even communicate on a spiritual level. They could produce avatars to interact more directly with the people if they so choose. This is most apparent in the existence of Spirits within the shards. Spirits are creatures made manifest from the power of individual shards. Champions partner with spirits to enhance their powers, cast spells from different elements than their own, and to perform incredible feats. People who use shardlight must do so by channeling the energy through a physical shard: a piece of the tower from which the shardlight originated. For example, if someone wanted to channel Scarlet shardlight, they would need a shard broken off of the Scarlet Tower. In the card game, these will be represented as our resource system. Think of the towers as bottle caps on top of a shaken-up soda pop: if a tower falls or were to be removed, the resulting explosion of energy would be catastrophic. As described above, the towers are somewhat cognizant and as such demand certain sacrifices from those that would use their power. The Shadow Tower, for example, demands blood. The Vigilant Tower demands emotion. The specific demands of each tower are closely held secrets by those that control the Districts in which the towers reside; if others were to discover the means of extracting power from the towers, they could theoretically offer sacrifices to the tower to replenish their stores of Shardlight. No District would give up their power so easily, as each color of Shardlight corresponds to a different element and set of abilities. Each of the six districts surrounds a tower. Below, I have listed each of the towers, their surrounding districts, symbol, and more. The Argent Tower Primary Color: Silver Element: Neutral District Name: The City of Silver, Silver Symbol: Silver Lynx Demographics: The City of Silver surrounding the Argent Tower is one of the most diverse in all of Turrim. People of every creed, color, and birth-district flock to the neutral safety of the City of Silver. It has two major ports with excellent waterway access to the other districts, making it an economic powerhouse. Religious cults and scholars can be seen. To the north, one can easily see the Shadow Tower, made of gray slate, and to the south, the Vigilant Tower, made from pristine white marble. Political Body: A network of local politicians vie for power, but the true influence in the City of Silver is in the hands of the seafaring merchants. For those few influential families that control the seas control the economic ebb and flow of the city. Alignment: Neutral The Vigilant Tower Primary Color: Yellow Element: Light District Name: Knitehood Symbol: Sphynx Demographics: The Vigilant Tower is primarily organized into militaristic defenders who, as their name implies, remain vigilant in the face of an always-changing world. This is a strict military district almost entirely made up of military men and women. Their colors are white and purple and each member of the district needs at least a modicum of military training. Almost all have shaved heads and shaved eyebrows. They are people of few words, choosing instead to remain as stalwart bulwarks against their foes. They desire order more than chaos. Political Body: Everything in the district serves the military force stationed within. Alignment: Starts out as the Rose; betrays them, joins the Forge The Azure Tower Primary Color: Blue Element: Water District Name: Stormheld Symbol: Vampire Squid Demographics: Stormheld shares a main waterway with the City of Silver, and therefore has a thriving merchant community as well. This attracts men and women of every persuasion; it is the largest District geographically and by population. It is a beautiful, colorful place with much of society centered around the docks. Mei-Yu Political Body: Various magical cults vie for power over Stormheld. The most prominent of these is the Iaikuma, led by Mei Yu, a powerful channeler with a hidden agenda. In this world, magic and science often go hand-in-hand; in Stormheld, you could find an enchanter on the same street as a DNA-splicing scientist. Alignment: The Forge Shardlight Research Facility in Stormheld The Skytree Tower Primary Color: Green Element: Air District Name: Sol Symbol: An Alkonost Demographics: If Stormheld controls the waterways, then Sol controls the skies. Between the two, almost all control of trade and commerce is under their purview. Nearly the entire district surrounding the tower is a desolate, barren desert; the tower, uniquely, is thinnest at its base, growing like running vines rapidly as it ascends to the heavens. Eventually, the vines blossom into a tremendous bulb, upon which the district truly resides. The people of Sol are an aerial, somewhat militarized bunch. Their cousins in the outskirts of the district are an agrarian society of farmers and ranchers. Beyond the deserts underneath the tower lay quite possibly the most beautiful lands in all the districts, and where our main character, Ariana, grew up. Political Body: This district is one of the most spread out and includes those that live on the branches of the tower in the sky and the �sandlanders� beneath. Those living in the agrarian areas of the district are largely inspired visually from Oriental and Aztec societies. As such, they typically wear beautiful, fine silks with big bursts of color. The people are generally beautiful, positive, forward-thinking and colorful. They laugh easily and love music. They would prefer not to think about politics much and leave much of the war-waging to the Shogunate of the Sun. As in our history, the shoguns are a sort of de facto shadow government; while the physical landscape of Sol is doused in splendid sunlight, the politics are shadowy and bloody. The Shogunate employs futuristic ninjas as spies and a unique mixture of Aztec and Samurai styles as foot-soldiers. Alignment: The Forge Eitan The Shadow Tower Primary Color: Dark grays, charcoal, black Element: Darkness District Name: Gloom Symbol: Crow Political Body: The people of Gloom are quick to smile � too quick. You can never fully Demographics: District Gloom has an almost Tim Burton-esque vibe; the people of Gloom have huge personalities, a flair for the dramatic, and a tremendous sense of style. They wear tailored suits with pinstripes and patterns, bowties, occasional top hats, carry canes... They are largely pale, having lived most of their lives underneath the darkness of the Shadow Tower, with long, thin limbs and conniving minds. They are almost vampiric in appearance and tend to stay away from overly sunny spots; you won�t see many District Gloom residents vacationing on the beaches of Sol. In many ways, this district is a gothic wonderland. While most people prefer to handle their dealings behind the scenes with overly complicated lawsuits and sowing chaos through the legal system, the frontline of their defense is a group of citizen-policemen gunslingers. As opposed to the finely tailored suits the dandies of Gloom prefer, the gunslingers wear cured leather, stylish hats, ride destriers, and carry shardlight-infused hand cannons (i.e., guns). Gunslingers have their own independent codes of morality and ethics that differ from one to the next. trust a citizen of Gloom; but you can trust that they�re trying to get one over on you. It may not be apparent; they are masters of the long con, twisting and turning every situation to their favor. As such, they are the most distrusted member of the Rose; both other districts believe they would change sides as soon as it became convenient. While individuals in Gloom are highly efficient, the government is anything but � by design. They are key trading partners with Stormheld, despite being on opposite ends of the Forge/Rose war. Alignment: Rose The Scarlet Tower Primary Color: Crimsons and deep Element: Fire District Name: Rao Symbol: Dragon Demographics: District Rao is primarily made up of aristocratic factory-owning elites and the blue-collar workers that perform the grunt work; this district is where nearly all machines are made. The waterways cannot be used by anyone except the Rao, who have developed special boats and marine vessels designed to withstand the heat. As such, their underwater animal life has evolved to adhere to the heat; it is said that long, slithering dragons live in the Lava Oceans, as they�re called. The closer one gets to Stormheld, the cooler the water becomes. Nearly all of the trees in this district are scarred by unending burns. However, pieces of bark from these trees are used in various potions, including healing and more. Political Body: The Rao are the only people that still adhere to a sort of constitutional monarchy � the �High Lord� rules in name above all of the other Lords, who rule over the Handlers. But the High Lord is rather ineffectual; he�s a young ruler, just into his 20s, and lacks the power of command his elderly father had. The Lords tend to ignore them and work as somewhat independent fiefdoms. One potential side-story could be the rise or fall of the royal family; they are, of course, named Rao.

We're highlighting the emotional, scary, real parts of her story so her struggles and victories don't fade away like so many do. Many families feel like their loved one's stories are slipping through their fingers--confused about how to capture a meaningful representation of how they feel. Imagine being able to see a film of your great-great grandmother you've never met. It's not just a slideshow but a very well-made film. You see her telling the story. You hear her voice. You're able to emotionally connect to her, and it's engaging enough to actually sit through the whole thing. You feel like you actually connected with someone you won't ever met in this life, but still your sense of belonging to your family and ancestry explodes. That's the vision we have. Someone needs to start making these films happen. There are so many films on the ""big screen"" about fictional characters, in a fictional world, leaving us without much ""real"" material to bring into our own lives. We want to add our voices to the fight for light, by pushing for more real and honest content focused on REAL PEOPLE whose relatable stories can inspire your own. And you're getting their story first-hand, from their own mouth.

Our first model headphones that block out sound were first invented by an airplane pilot (who is more qualified than that?) for long flights and since then have become a vital part of daily travel and life. Some people use them for added clarity when listening to music and audio or just with the noise cancelling activated for turning down the sounds of the world. Active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones are perfect for reducing the roaring sounds of engines and traffic from public transportation, the chattering of busy city life, coworker voices in the office or the everyday distracting sounds at home or school. Now the big question, there are so many headphones out there how do you choose? With all the over-priced big brand headphones we have made it our mission to offer a premium ANC headphone without breaking the bank. Like you, we have family and daily expenses that must come first. We have worked strategically with our factory to deliver an ANC headphone that features many, if not more, of the features of more expensive brands.

We followed with out first set of 14 Garden of Yokai pins in January of this year, creating Cat, Fox, Rabbit, Deer and even a Koi Fish mermaid!

A wildly creative and motivated team of University of Florida students and alumni filmmakers are embarking on another adventure this summer. This group is set to film in June of 2019 a fantastically wicked horror film. This Kickstarter is being put towards our budget for the film. It will be used on any equipment, props, outfits, production design, food for crew and location creation for the film. The support through this page will help create opportunities for all the members in our cast and crew to gain valuable experience that will benefit them in their future careers. We are all dedicated to making this film the best it can be. It would be greatly appreciated by the crew for any help and support that is given. After production, we plan to submit this into festivals because we believe that it has the potential to shake up the horror genre. Below is a summary of ""Growing Pains"". We hope you take the time to peak inside our little creation. Summary: DARREL has just graduated High School with his two best friends, TREVOR and JENNIE. He is under the impression that all 3 of them will stay together in the small town during college, Trevor and Jennie have different plans. They plan to move away to start their own separate adventures. In the hope to change Darrel�s mind and motivate him to move on, Jennie and Trevor have dug up the time capsule the 3 buried together as children. One last trip down memory lane turns into a night of nightmares, when the 3 friends don�t only open a box of memories but open the gate for a fiendish and horrific figure, called The Gazer. As Jennie and Trevor work to rid themselves of The Gazer�s torture, Darrel is determined to show the true potential The Gazer has as the savior of their friendship."

It is not a modern struggle, but rather one that has been present in our country for generations. The parallels between immigration in 1910's Texas and immigration now is both eerie and fascinating. Our film follows two Latina women in 1910's Texas, a mother and daughter, who are migrants from Mexico seeking a better life. Their lives are put in danger when they happen to be caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they go from hunting rabbits to becoming the hunted. By looking at a familiar issue through a historical context, we are able to examine the impact of how we treated immigrants then and let it inform our treatment of them now. Through the female characters of this story, we see the time period through a feminine lens, offering a human visage point to this deeply divisive issue, all while connecting it to the relevant issues we face as a country today. Historical Setting: In 1910, a bloody revolution exploded throughout Mexico, when the dictator Porfirio Diaz was challenged by intellectuals and liberals. This war of ideals became known as the Mexican Revolution, and was a concomitant reason for the brutal treatment of Mexicans living in the Texas Borderlands during this time. The reported violence occurring in Mexico (thievery, murder, arson) of Mexican citizens against their countrymen and U.S. citizens travelled fast to the Texas border. This forever tainted the image of the Mexican, whether they were Tejanos, Mexican-Americans, or Mexican migrants. They were all seen as violent, dirty, sinful people who could not be trusted. Therefore, the Anglo-Texans, who felt most threatened by their ever-growing presence in the country believed extralegal violence was not only necessary, but mandatory to protect themselves. This fear continued to grow in large part from the fear mongering, prejudice, and bias put out by state and local news outlets, clumping all Mexicans together in the same category, demonizing them and marring the trust between the Mexicans living in Texas and their Anglo neighbors. This anti-American rhetoric that got passed around and reported on, was held in high regard as fact, and became the driving force behind the prejudice and righteous fury Anglos had towards the Mexicans living in their country as the Revolution surged on. During this brutal time, Mexicans found their lives and livelihoods increasingly at risk by segregation, lynchings, and outright racism. It is something all too familiar in our country right now, a human issue we still grapple with finding an answer to, and one we must work together towards repairing. Director's Statement Have you ever felt connected to a story, but don't know why? That's how I explain why I was drawn to this history and creating the story of these two women. I'm intrigued by unknown histories and the people within them, and that is what drew me to this project. The humanity of it. The tragedy of prejudice and hate, and how that affects the lives of people. To understand this story, to feel empathy for these people and this time, you just need to be human. We can see ourselves in these characters, feel for them, root for them. To me this film is an anti-Western, we don't see this story through a white man's perspective, but rather the migrants'. How many Westerns can you count that have women of color at the center, that tell their history, and more importantly, show their perspective? Not many. Along with my natural curiosity in the places that surround me, my life and experiences inform my writing. This story harkens back to a difficult trauma my mother and I experienced, and having the center of the story be between a mother and daughter was no mistake. It was incredibly important to me that it centered around two women caught in a horrific situation and how they dealt with it. More importantly, I wanted to explore the human face of immigration, of moving, of migrating, from someone else's perspective. How do the choices we make affect the lives of those around us? What steps must we take as people, as a society, to ensure that this history does not repeat itself? Why support us in finishing this film? In this political landscape, this story feels at once foreign and familiar. It is from a different time, but the parallels of where we were then and where we are now are undeniable. It is a history rarely, if ever, visited in cinema today or in generations past, and we feel it is imperative to shed light on something that has had lingering effects on Mexican immigrants. By supporting this film, you are supporting this little know history being shared with a larger audience, Mexican history, and the career of a female filmmaker. Women directors are historically the most under-represented demographic in Hollywood--something that is slowly changing, but there is still much work to be done. By supporting this film, you are helping a female filmmaker get her film out into the world. Once the film is completed it is going on to be a apart of an immigration-in-cinema series at Violet Crown Cinema in Austin and then will be screening at 3 different ACLU locations in Texas. The ACLU screenings will be followed by immigrants' rights panels! We are so lucky to have the support of these organizations, but we cannot make these events happen without finishing the film first.

The screenplay, written by Annie Bradford, took over 2 years to hone, a plethora of research, and over 103 rewrites. Actress Emma Perez-Trevino served as the translator for the script, and brought her experience as a former news reporter on the southern border to the storytelling process. Writer/Director Annie Bradford talks with actress Emma Perez-Trevino about the next scene. Alonso Lujan joined the crew as the Director of Photography. It was really important for us to have someone who was passionate about the story leading the camera team, and Lujan captured beautiful footage with them. The post production team is also full of compelling, talented, hard-working artists who come from diverse backgrounds. DP Alonso Lujan talks about the set ups for the next scene with his camera team, Beca Rodriguez and Sean Salcido.

She's thrilled to be joining this project and designing the soundscape of this film. Daniel Fernandez/ Music Composition Hailing from Honduras, Austin-based musician Daniel Fernandez gravitated towards music at an early age. He loves exploring new ways to tell stories through music and is so thrilled to be completing the original composition for this film. Daniel leads the rock quartet band, The Halfways, in Austin, TX, and their music has been described as ""energetic"", ""full of sonic textures"", and ""unusual song structures"". Cullen Kelly / Color Correction Cullen Kelly is an LA-based colorist, writer, and director. His film work has been been featured at SXSW and other festivals. He's had a successful colorist career as well doing work for several music videos, commercials, and TV shows, which have been featured in Rolling Stone and Netflix among others. He's excited to be apart of this special project and bring the images to life that Lujan created for this film.

OVERVIEW Pleasant Canyon is, in it's essence, the story of two Irish brothers at odds. Having grown up in a household where their father's life was ruled by the bottle, Dusty and Jasper O'Banion have been through quite a lot before we meet them. After losing his ranch on a wild placed bet in Oklahoma Indian territory, Emmett O'banion moved his family to Carson City, NV under the false pretense that a distant cousin of his had founded the silver mining enterprise that ruled the development of the area. With a defiled family name in town, his two sons were forced to fend for themselves and defend their own integrity against the other townsfolk. It's not until their father is shot and killed in a bar fight that each of them must find their own journey to making sure their mother is taken care of. Our story takes place after Jasper has left town on a mission to rob several banks and bring home money to save their mother from another ill fated marriage. We meet Jasper as his brother breaks him out of the Ballarat jailhouse in the deserts of California. This is story of their journey together, trying to find peace with each other and make it south to avoid being killed by a posse of Pinkerton agents and law folk. Western in genre, the period piece focuses on the dynamic of a sibling relationship that's been shattered due to their family's struggle against alcoholism. Dusty, the older of the two, has spent the last five years of his life working in the Carson City mines to bring home enough money to support his family. Jasper, who was always much closer with his mother, has devised a plan to rid the family of their troubles for good. When he's caught after robbing two banks further south he's forced to rely on his brother to get them out of harms way and head to Mexico. WHY THIS STORY? The plight of Jasper's fight to save his mother is close to home for me, as I too had to try and help my own mother after my parents' divorce from the pitfalls of trusting a new man unworthy of her love. In many ways Jasper's sacrifice and journey to a darker side of life is a small piece of me that I hope others who have gone through a similar situation will be able to relate to. Beyond that, the tail of two brothers trying to make amends, working both together and against each other is a dynamic that we can all relate to in some way or another. Being raised in a town of 2000 people, all of my best friends are brothers to me blood or not. We've been through highs and lows and when I was young one of those irreplaceable friends passed away. Ultimately, this story is a reflection of many things in my own life as well as an homage to my love for the western genre. WHY A WESTERN? Having grown up in Telluride, CO I've been fascinated by the west since I was a kid. Now a ski town, the San Juan mountains once produced millions of dollars of gold in their heyday. Tails of Alfred Packer, Soapy Smith, Butch Cassidy and the Hole In The Wall Gang and the history that goes along with the west holds a special place in my heart. Directors like Leone, Corbucci, Peckinpah, Tarantino have created amazing works of cinema that continue to inspire me today and in all of that I endeavor to create my own tails of the west. This is the start of that mission. Think of Dusty's story as the prologue for another film down the line. WHY AM I ASKING FOR HELP? We will be making this short no matter the outcome of the kickstarter. However, any help that I can get from friends, family, or anyone else willing to put their trust in me as a storyteller will go a long way. Creating a period piece is no small feat and it requires an enormous amount of support from some very talented people. I have an incredible crew taking shape, with two phenomenal leads and we're lucky enough to shoot on 2 perf 35mm film, with a Director of Photography on board who will help take this project to a higher place than I could have ever dreamed of. WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO? Not only will your donations help us feed and house the crew on location - they will help us cover permitting and insurance costs; fund critical story elements like props, costumes, animals; allow us to secure the necessary gear and support; and most importantly make sure we have everything needed to create a safe environment on set."

It is also an intimate, genuine, and often funny portrayal of one of the most daring nonviolent direct actions in recent history, as well as the unbreakable bonds of friendship that were forged along the way. We are entering a critical moment in the Tibetan people's epic struggle for freedom. Reeling under seven decades of Chinese occupation, Tibet remains one of the world's last, and most oppressed, colonies. China�s all-out campaign to erase Tibet from the global consciousness, by means of coercion and cash, has created a conspiracy of silence on the issue. But Tibetans in Tibet, as well as in exile, continue to resist China's tyranny in their own creative ways, through acts of resistance wherever and whenever possible. With this film, we will propel Tibet to the center of the global spotlight, just as China prepares to host the 2022 Olympic Games. To reach fresh audiences, members of the Everest Action Team have reunited to share their harrowing and inspirational protest story with the world for the first time. We have assembled a �dream team� of experienced storytellers and high-caliber filmmakers to produce a unique, engaging documentary that we hope will inspire a new generation of people to support the Tibetan cause. Tibet is one of the most restricted places on the planet today - a no-go zone for international journalists and foreign watchdogs - but our film slips between the bars. Where the Earth Meets the Sky is a compelling tale of courage and international solidarity; of friends uniting for something much bigger than themselves; of taking risks to see a bit more justice in the world. Produced by the Everest Action Team themselves, this film is designed to leverage the upcoming Olympic media spotlight to draw attention to China�s growing authoritarianism, widespread surveillance, and ongoing brutality in Tibet. Our team is passionate and driven to make this film come to life, and we are confident we have the right plan and tools to turn it into a major success. We have come as far as we can through self-funding and volunteered time and so, in order to take our film to the next level, we need the support of our community and those out there we haven't yet met but who are committed to supporting Tibetan freedom and innovative, independent, documentary filmmaking. In essence, if you're reading this, we need you!

Everest Action Team & Students for a Free Tibet Synopsis: A group of unlikely, tech-savvy activists orchestrates a high-stakes heist on Mount Everest to steal China's global spotlight ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games, refocusing the world's attention on occupied Tibet. Pulling off the near-impossible and inspiring a generation of activists, this film reveals a rare, behind-the-scenes, glimpse into an historic moment in Tibet's ongoing struggle for freedom. Storyline: In 2007, five young activists, including one Tibetan, entered occupied Tibet, breached a militarized zone on the side of Mount Everest, and launched a nonviolent protest of historic proportions. As part of its aggressive lobby to win the Olympic Games, China promised the most spectacular ""Torch Relay"" in Olympic history, including summiting Mt. Everest, the world's tallest mountain. For Tibetans, such a symbol of international unity paraded across their occupied country was the height of mockery and disrespect. For human rights activists, it also represented the opportunity of a generation: a chance to steal China�s coveted Olympic Spotlight and shine it instead on the horrific occupation of Tibet. Indeed, the elaborate Global Torch Relay and the Opening Ceremonies for Beijing�s 2008 Games were the most widely watched events in human history. At the center of our story is Tendor, �The Torchbearer,� a young Tibetan born in exile and raised in the Tibetan Children�s Village refugee schools in Dharamsala, India, founded by His Holiness the Dalai Lama�s sister. Tendor was brought up on stories of Tibetan resistance, living side by side with friends and schoolmates who escaped Tibet as children (some of whom lost their limbs to frostbite while crossing the Himalayas) and were desperate to see their families again. He grew up longing for the day he would see his homeland with his own eyes, like any exile yearning to return to a free Tibet. Never did he imagine that when that day came, he�d be traveling incognito, mostly hiding in hotels, and pretending to be anything but Tibetan. Surrounding Tendor is a group of undercover activists, each with a unique skill for the mission�s success. Lhadon, �The Mastermind,� leads Students for a Free Tibet - the organization that planned the daring protest - and is the public voice of the action. Shannon, �The Organizer,� is charged with building her �dream team� for accomplishing the risky mission, and acts as the central hub of the group�s connection, personally recruiting each member. Laurel, �The Smooth Talker,� has years of experience with nonviolent direct action planning and dealing with authority figures while putting his body on the line for his convictions. Kirsten, �The Smuggler,� has spent her career ferrying funds and information across borders for an underground network of frontline activists. Jeff, �The Geek,� is a highly trained mountaineer and direct action activist with a brilliant mind for outsmarting the technological obstacles the team eventually faces. Tendor�s love for his homeland, coupled with his enduring faith in his people, drive the team�and the film�ever forward towards Everest and their inevitable arrest. At night, in the cover of their hotel rooms, they are busy making protest T-shirts, assembling a large banner, and designing the �Opening Ceremony for Team Tibet.� By day, they struggle to hold their tongues and pretend to be charmed by China�s grotesque development of Tibet in order to earn the trust of government minders and nosey tour operators, and to avoid provoking any suspicion of their true intentions. The team�s mission is to expose China's Olympic Torch Relay as a massive publicity stunt meant to cover up the truth of Beijing's appalling human rights record, including the brutal, decades-long occupation of Tibet. To this end, they stage a colorful protest, rich with symbolism and strong messaging�from 17,500 feet. They successfully conduct�and broadcast�their Opening Ceremony for Team Tibet, unveiling a protest banner and lighting a unique butter-lamp torch, while Tendor sings the banned Tibetan National Anthem. They are immediately arrested at gunpoint and whisked away into days of intense interrogation. Meanwhile, out in the world, the action is a success. When China unveils its torch route the following day, outlets from CNN to Sports Illustrated pair that story with the Tibetan independence activists who protested on Everest and �haven�t been heard from since.� The team has hijacked China's Olympic limelight before the torch relay even begins, putting Tibet�s occupation front and center at a time that China desperately wants the world to forget it. With the 2021 release of Where the Earth Meets the Sky we plan to again challenge the Chinese government's false narrative on Tibet and remind the world that a few committed voices of dissent can forever change the story.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my first-ever Kickstarter campaign! With this campaign I'm hoping to raise enough funds to get my first enamel pin into production! I'm Kathleen and I'm best known for sewing pincushion cats. I have a small business called ""The Fat Cat Factory"" where I get to let my imagination run wild. I get to take all my quirky cat designs I have in my head and turn them into tangible products for other people to love and enjoy. Or at the very least, make someone smile. The bulk of my work has been from sewing and turning my cats into felt pincushions, ornaments, magnets and garlands. This has been a project in the making for many years. I've always wanted to turn my cat designs into enamel pins. And I've finally decided to go for it! So that is what this Kickstarter campaign has been created for...to help bring this concept into an actuality. And with your support, pledges and sharing of this fundraiser, I'm sure we'll be able to accomplish it! For those of you new to Kickstarter, here's how it works: The funding system is all-or-nothing. The campaign will run for 30 days and during that time you can pledge to help fund the project. And you are only charged if the campaign is successfully funded. If the initial funding goal isn't met, no one gets charged anything. Pledging for the styles you're interested in (even if they are still locked) will contribute to unlocking those (and more) styles. All pledges, big or small, will help to reach the ultimate goal of a full 5 pin collection! You can change your pledge, or cancel, at anytime while the campaign is still active. Though, you will not be able to change your pledge after the campaign ends. After the campaign ends, if successfully funded, surveys will be sent out to obtain which of the unlocked pins you choose and to gather shipping address. Feel free to contact me! I'm here to answer any questions and/or concerns you may have! When I was thinking about which of my cat characters I wanted to try making pins of first, I kept coming back to Halloween. I absolutely love Halloween and it is my favorite time of the year. And what goes better with Halloween than cats, right? So it only made sense to have my first enamel pin collection be ""Halloween Fat Cats""! The 1st pin that I'm hoping to get into production is my personal favorite: the Jack-o-lantern cat! Once that initial funding goal is met, then the other cat designs... Ghost, Vampire, Black Cat and Skeleton... will start to get unlocked as their stretch funding goals are met. So the more pledges coming in means there is a better chance of getting all 5 styles funded. All pledges, big or small, will help to reach the ultimate goal of a full collection! Pledging for the styles you're interested in (even if they are still locked) will contribute to unlocking more styles. **The Stretch Goals have been updated thanks to a pledge offline! My mom and aunt wanted to pledge but don't know how to use the internet (and my mom doesn't even have a computer) so they gave me a check. Haha...gotta love family! So that's great new to all of us and the new unlocking pledge goal costs have been adjusted!** **In the final hours, I've decided to go ahead and ""Unlock"" the Vampire Cat pin! I will self-fund him so backers will now have 3 pin styles to choose from! Yay! (pincushion and ornaments are open to all 5 styles) The bulk of the funds will go towards manufacturing of the pins. Since this is my first time making pins I've chosen to go the route of using a middle-person instead of a direct-to-factory. Yes, the cost is a little more than what they'd be if I used a factory direct. But I honestly feel that this is a safer way to go since I don't have a tried-and-true factory. Going through a middle-person is helping me to make sure my designs are ready for production and they'll be able to help fix any issues that may arise through the manufacturing process. Plus this company was highly recommended to me and is already proving to be very helpful to a new enamel pin designer, such as myself. I feel that my pins will be in very safe hands! Again, since this is my first experience in enamel pin making, I'm allowing 1-2 months for production time. I'm hoping the 2 month mark is an over-estimation, but I figure it's better to allow for any unexpected delays that may come up. For backers within the US: The majority will be getting shipped out with USPS First Class Mail, with tracking included. Depending on the weight, some of the packages will be getting shipped out USPS Priority Mail (the rewards with multiple pincushions included) For international backers: There will be a flat fee of $8 for shipping to Canada. And a flat fee of $12 for shipping to Everywhere Else. All packages will be insured, but sadly the tracking will usually drop off once it leaves the US. Please note international backers are responsible for any customs, tax, etc... which may be charged by your specific county. I'm sorry about that but it is out of my control! And I will always declare the full value of your pledge on all international custom forms and will list it as merchandise not as a ""gift"". It is illegal for one to do so otherwise. Or course I had to include some of my original Fat Cats into the reward levels! Though the Black Cat (in all forms...pincushion, ornament and garland) has never been available to purchase before! He's a brand new style I made to compliment his enamel pin counterpart. Along with the enamel pins, included in some of the pledge levels will be, limited quantities, of pincushions, ornaments and garlands. Those pledge levels will be available in limited quantity. And some of them, due to the higher shipping weight, won't be available for shipping outside the US. The garland will feature the 5 enamel cat pin styles: Jack-o-lantern, Ghost, Vampire, Black Cat and Skeleton Thank you for taking the time to look through everything and reach all the way to the very bottom here! You are awesome! So just for you, I've added a little bit of fun random trivia about myself: my lucky number is 8, my favorite animal is the Pallas Cat (or the Wombat or the Groundhog - I go back and forth often), I have a border-line obsession with Buster Keaton and I have Lupus. Shout out to all my fellow Spoonies! When I'm not sewing Fat Cats, I'm playing with my 2 furbabies: Little Nina and Fatty Elvis. I wish everyday was Halloween so I would have a reason to keep up my decorations year-round and make more costumes...(This year I'm hoping to make a Squirrel Girl costume). I never learned to ride a bike and I often trip going up the steps. My sewing room walls are this super bright lime green which everyone, but me, seems to hate. I love reading and will try any and/or all books but I can't seem to make it through a Stephen King book. Ever. And I've tried multiple books, multiple times. And lastly, I'm terrified of yellow-jackets. I will hyperventilate and possibly pass out. And if you liked all that, come say hi on social media!

This project will fund an ""absurdist, surrealistic"" alternate history anthology, entitled RAMMING THE RAMPARTS, containing approximately 9 or more all-original (no reprint) short stories by some of todays hottest SF&F authors. The inspiration comes from our current President's recent commentary on the Fourth of July, including the idea that our Army ""took over the airports"" during the Revolutionary War. What if there had been airports during that war? Absurd! George Washington was not a fighter pilot! There was no ""Battle at LaGuardia Baggage Claim""! And yet... This anthology asks authors to explore these and other absurd, surrealistic alternate histories. These DO NOT need to be based off of our current President's comments, either on July 4th or at any other time. However, I'd like to see at least a few stories based off of airports during the Revolution. I'd like to keep the stories set around that era, actually, so the 18th Century or so, although this is not a hard and fast rule. Backers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce an ebook of the anthology�including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Confirmed anchor authors include: Gerald Brandt David B. Coe Esther Friesner Elektra Hammond Nancy Holzner Rhondi Salsitz Steven H Silver Alan Smale Harry Turtledove Confirmed Stretch Goal authors include: Walter H. Hunt Gini Koch Kristine Kathryn Rusch This is a ""quick and dirty"" Kickstarter from Zombies Need Brains, so at the moment there is no cover art. Stretch goals will include expansion of the anthology beyond the initial 9 authors to include stories from an open call and possibly a paperback version of the book. We offer professional pay rates. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, including an open submission window if the Kickstarter is successful and reaches certain stretch goals, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current theme for a chance to be part of the anthology. And Zombies Need Brains is officially a ""qualifying market"" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)! ZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors. Check out our current offerings: Temporally Out of Order Alien Artifacts Were- Submerged All Hail Our Robot Conquerors! The Death of All Things Guilds & Glaives Second Round: A Return to the Ur-Bar The Razor's Edge Portals Temporally Deactivated Alternate Peace at https://squareup.com/market/zombies-need-brains-llc. You can also find them online at Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble; they are available in trade paperback format as well as on almost all ebook platforms (Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Scribd, etc.). If the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of October 2019. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of December 2019 and the ebook to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2020. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the number of the stories in the book, allow for higher production values for the ebooks, increased advertising, and potentially the production of a paperback edition of the book. Stretch goals would include adding additional story slots to the books (most of which will be filled with an open call for submissions), producing a paperback, etc. We will add additional stretch goals as the Kickstarter proceeds. Stretch Goal: Once the Kickstarter reaches $6,000, we will add Walter H. Hunt as an anchor author to the anthology! Stretch Goal: Once the Kickstarter reaches $7,000, we will add Gini Koch as an anchor author to the anthology! Stretch Goal: Once the Kickstarter reaches $8,000, we will add Kristine Kathryn Rusch as an anchor author to the anthology! Stretch Goal: Once the Kickstarter reaches $10,000, we will do an open call for submissions to the anthology in order to fill SIX additional story slots, so the anthology will contain a minimum of 18 stories. Zombies Need Brains LLC is a small press owned and operated by Joshua Palmatier that focuses on producing professional quality science fiction and fantasy themed anthologies initially funded by Kickstarters. Having successfully published ten anthologies in the last five years, ZNB is currently expanding its anthology production, with the intent to eventually publish stand-alone books once the press has gained its footing.

As of the end of this campaign, there is no contact button on Kickstarter. To send us a message please click here or on this banner: It's rare to be able to work on something you love. This is what happened with On the Underground. Long out of print, it was a favourite in our gaming group and when we realized that the rights were available, we reached out to Sebastian Bleasdale and, well, here we are! The massive network of London Underground stations makes up one of the most complex transportation systems in the world, and On the Underground challenges you to develop it. Build the most successful lines, connect them to landmarks and attract passenger traffic! On the Underground is a game for players who love to create. While seemingly a simple game, the strategic depth takes you beyond other network-building games such as Ticket to Ride, Thurn & Taxis and Through the Desert. Besides each game being different due to the on-board objectives, the Passenger introduces a singular challenge to each turn of the game, inviting you to participate (and earn points) even when it is not your turn. This edition of On the Underground includes the all-new Berlin map, a challenging change of pace for those who have played the original London one, which has also been updated to match the real-life Underground and improve gameplay. Besides adding Berlin and improving the art and graphic design, we took the opportunity to perfect the contents of the game, and even more so for the Deluxe edition that we hope to create with your support! We decided early on to include more than one Passenger shape options, and thus the five custom-shaped tokens were born. Three of them (wheelchair user, elderly and pregnant) were kindly provided by Ian O'Toole and Alban Viard. In addition, we felt the need to do even more to thank you for your support, and with something truly special. That is why we created the transparent acrylic token, and we gave it a shape that may be familiar to our previous backers... Finally, we decided to wrap the whole package up in something even more ""Deluxe"", a beautiful slip case that will have your box shining amongst others on your shelf - literally. The wraparound UV coating on the water-colour graphical elements gives it an elegant sheen that stands out. The Deluxe edition will be available through this campaign (including any retail backers - see below) and through events where we participate. We also wanted to make sure that we offer the basic edition of the game to those who do not want improved components. There are no other differences between the two editions. Note that the included rulebook for any basic edition copies fulfilled as part of this campaign may depict Deluxe components. In On the Underground, players compete to build the most valuable and convenient transportation network in London or Berlin. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players. At the beginning of each turn, 4 Destination cards are facing up, corresponding to stations on the map. A player�s turn consists of taking four actions, followed by the Passenger�s movement. After the player�s turn, the Passenger token is moved along built lines and avoiding empty track spaces as much as possible, in order to reach 1 or 2 Destination stations. The Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, and then play passes to the next player in clockwise order. Players score points in two ways: � By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by building a circular line in London, or by collecting Landmark tiles in Berlin. � By having the Passenger use their lines when moving. The game is over after all Destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns. The player that has earned the most points is the winner, having built the most valuable network On the Underground!

Solo David Turczi has worked with Sebastian to create a really cool solo mode, with its materials available as a post-campaign add-on, via Backerkit. As usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free by clicking here: Note: The videos below show prototype components. The game may look really good in these videos, but know that the final product is even better (linen-finish cards, board & box, wooden screen-printed tokens, etc.). With that said, here we go!

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT. Shipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 39 USD / 52 CAD / 57 AUD / 39 CHF / 4288 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees. We can also not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken. Certain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. We expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped. Regrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or at any other convention. We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained. Costs The real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. It includes costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them. EU: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD USA: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD Worldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: At least 18-28 USD IMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit. Retailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/on-the-underground-london-berlin/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations This offer is available only to retailers which have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. Stores with event space will be prioritized and all entities and locations will be verified. Online-only retailers will be considered in territories where there no physical retailers have backed the campaign. Fulfillment will be conducted in the following steps: 1. Individual backers 2. Physical stores 3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step There will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit. Only retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order the game, should there be any stock available, for at least 6 months after fulfillment has commenced. Please contact us for more information. What You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials. We also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add ""hidden"" profit in the pledge levels that we can then ""spend"" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals. Retail availability: We pledge that, along with the exception of a limited number of retail backer and convention copies, your games will arrive long before the game (the basic edition) is available through wide distribution. SPIEL availability: Should production be completed in time, we plan to airship a limited number of copies to Essen, where we will be selling them. As mentioned above, we can not offer pickup there or at any other convention, and we can not guarantee availability.

Charles Manson. Rodney Alcala. All these serial murderers had something in common: they were good-looking�dare I say fuckable?�and deeply charismatic. Also, they were pathetic, whiny baby-men who were so pathologically incapable of handling rejection that they literally had to kill people to feel better. Let�s face it: true crime is having something of a moment. From podcasts like Serial to fictionalized retellings like American Crime Story, murder media is saturating our airwaves. But the real horror story�the one going untold�is that so much of this is happening because dudes don�t know how to handle their feelings. Enter RIDING IN SUBARUS WITH BOYS. When Iris� friends drive away from a campsite parking lot while she�s in the bathroom, she�s stranded in the middle of nowhere with an overstuffed backpack and a dead phone. She decides to hitch a ride, and as luck would have it, the first person to stop for her is a cute guy named Noah who likes the same weirdo music as her. But as soon as Iris lets her guard down, she discovers that Noah may not be as harmless as he looks... Tonally, RIDING IN SUBARUS WITH BOYS is what would happen if the protagonist of IT FOLLOWS stood up halfway through the movie and was like, �Wait, what the fuck?� Much like the patriarchy, this project straddles the line between a horror film and a dark comedy: it�s a story about how women are expected to work overtime to help emotionally stunted men deal with their feelings, even if it means putting ourselves in harm�s way. Depending on how you hold it up to the light, that fact is either terrifying, bleakly funny, or both. Visually, RIDING IN SUBARUS WITH BOYS combines the lush scenery of northern New Jersey with a rich, dark palette heavy in blues and greens. The goal is a dramatic, almost romantic look, to be juxtaposed with unsettling, awkward shot composition. Examples? Sure, we've got examples! Visual reference: IT FOLLOWS Visual reference: DEATH PROOF Visual reference: MILLENNIUM MAMBO Visual reference: HEATHERS SUBARUS writer/director Keely Weiss on location I�m making this movie because I believe we need to find a new way to talk about toxic masculinity. The attitude that �boys will be boys� is not yet extinct: Brett Kavanaugh�s Supreme Court confirmation last year served as ample evidence of this. And we already know that the consequences of this conditioning are dire�for proof, look at just about any news story involving the rape or murder of women. And even though movies and shows like Big Little Lies have us finally talking about the consequences of this kind of masculinity, it sometimes feels like we�re missing the point. Sure, men like Donald Trump or Alexander Skarsgard�s Big Little Lies character Perry Wright pose a real and dangerous threat, but the root of toxic masculinity isn�t �manly� behavior or even aggression: it�s entitlement. From GamerGate to �incel� culture, the internet is rife with examples of �nice� guys who feel so entitled to women�s time and attention that when they don�t get what they want, they believe they have a right to go out and take it. But we are afraid to offend the delicate sensibilities of the men around us by acknowledging that male fragility is putting us all in danger. I say screw that: it�s high time that we recognize �manliness� for the farce that it is. The sooner we decide it�s okay for men to be laughed at, the sooner women will stop dying. We're working with a badass crew featuring women in all lead roles. Meet our key collaborators: Keely Weiss (Writer/Director) is a writer and filmmaker. Her short film THE THING ABOUT US has screened at film festivals all over the world, including Outfest and BFI Flare, and was executive produced by Jill Soloway. Keely was previously the Features Editor at Harper�s BAZAAR and has written for Interview, Nylon, LA Weekly, and elsewhere. Marie Bardi (Producer) is a Brooklyn-based producer with experience in narrative features, branded content, and short films. Recent credits include the features HER SMELL (dir. Alex Ross Perry; Official Selection - TIFF and NYFF) and MODERN PERSUASION (dir. Jonathan Lisecki / Alex Appel; currently in post), and the shorts 86�D (dir. Alan Palomo; Vimeo Staff Pick) and THREE STARS (dir. Emily Yoshida; currently in post). She graduated with honors from NYU�s Tisch School of the Arts with a BA in Cinema Studies and Producing. Charlotte Hornsby (Director of Photography) is a cinematographer based in New York. She shot the 2017 and 2018 Sundance Film Festival Narrative Short Film Jury Award-winning films HAIR WOLF and LUCIA BEFORE AND AFTER. Her work has appeared in Pitchfork, Nylon, Rolling Stone, the Fader, MTV, The New Yorker, Vogue and at the Sundance Film Festival, SXSW, BAM Cinemafest and MoMA. We are currently working with a $15,000 budget which is coming entirely from personal savings. This money will cover most of production, but it's not quite enough, so we're looking to grants and this Kickstarter campaign to make up the difference. Here's the breakdown of where your $10,000 will go: Camera and equipment rentals: $4,300 Meals for cast and crew: $700 Post-production: $5,000 Any extra money raised past the initial $10,000 goal will help us cover submissions to film festivals and marketing materials."

Ahma & Alan still: Gregory Yuan as Alan (left). Akio Chen as Officer Bei (right).  -  () -  ( This film is based on personal experience: I moved to Taiwan after college to study Mandarin and to reconnect with family living there. I was almost deported for allegedly teaching English illegally at a kindergarten since I was not �Taiwanese� (i.e. no Taiwanese passport or ID). There was a law that forbids foreigners from teaching kindergarten in Taiwan for fear the children would be culturally corrupted. When I had to report to the police station, my ahma (grandma) came with me. She told the officers, �My grandson�s Taiwanese! He doesn�t need to work illegally, I can take care of him!� Seeing such strength come from this small, elderly woman gave me such pride to be her grandson and was part of the inspiration for this story. My ahma, circa 2006. | 2006. Ahma & Alan tackles identity issues many Asian Americans and the Asian diaspora face: What world do we belong to? Asia or America? This film shows the generational and cultural loss that comes with immigration, particularly in the loss of one�s heritage language. As a child (age 4-5) in the U.S., I was proud of my Taiwanese background and spoke an elemental mix of Taiwanese (Hokkien), Mandarin, and English. Entering kindergarten I was teased for my lack of English fluency. Going through elementary, I began to attach shame to speaking Mandarin and Taiwanese in public and a disdain for having to go to Chinese school. I didn�t want to be seen as less American or even worse, considered a FOB by others. I eventually lost my Mandarin and Taiwanese language ability. The connection I had with my non-English speaking grandparents, who were helping my parents raise me, grew tenuous and distant. Years later, after my grandparents had moved back to Taiwan, I visited my ahma and ahgong (grandpa) as an adult and I saw how unconditional familial love can still connect us across time and nationality. This is what I want to explore in Ahma & Alan. Me age 8 or so in California. 8 This is a passion project of mine that I�ve personally funded along with tremendous help from my family. Late 2018, I left my job in Los Angeles to travel to Taiwan and give this film 100% of my attention and energy. After much hard work, encouragement, and some luck, we were able to complete principle photography with an extraordinary local and international cast and crew. However, we�re stuck. I�m back in LA with the raw files for the film, but we don�t have the necessary funds to complete post production in addition to paying back deferred production costs. That�s why we need your help. Creating a high quality, professional short film, even after cutting costs, requires a large amount of resources and funds. Let's find out how much. Why the $18,000 goal? The funds from this Kickstarter will first be used to complete post-production costs for this film such as: Editing Coloring Sound mixing Musical score Costs estimated to be $9,000. The remaining $9,000 will be used to pay back a portion of the production costs of $23,000 such as: Crew Cast Gear Production Design Transportation Catering Remaining funds will be used towards marketing, festival fees, and travel. Thus the $18,000 is to cover a little over half of the total budget (56%). Here's a video where I give a more detailed breakdown of film budgeting. As you can see, making a high quality, professional level film costs money! Which is why we need your help. Ahma & Alan still: Grandma Lin (actor Mei-Hou Wu).

We grew tired of the usual hustle and bustle of corporate life, and we set out to do something good for ourselves and the community. The company started as just a production company, with a plan to produce green- to roasted-bean coffee, with a nerdy and an outdoorsy twist to it. We felt that both of those markets had no real representation in the coffee world, and we felt like both of those worlds pretty well represented who we are. We're video gamers, hikers, table-top RPG'ers, campers, and so much more. No one else seemed to really hit the nail on the head of what we wanted to convey. As the idea came closer to life, it became a store front; a place for everyone to come in for a cup of coffee, a latt�, or some un-thought-of concoction based on a video game character. We feel like everyone wants to feel that sense of adventure. Whether you're a desk jockey like we've almost always been, a travelling salesman, a professional rock climber, a video game streamer, a weekend warrior, or, well, anything... we want our coffee to give you the fuel to put you feet first into your next adventure. This Kickstarter hopes to be the foundation of a beautiful project that will unit a community, provide career potential for many individuals, breathe life into an avenue otherwise under-touched, and light the beacons so that more may know the way.

I present to you a badge designed to hack other badges. This badge is not only cool looking, but also features a playground for better understanding digital communication and a very useful tool for people of all skill levels in electronics. Not to mention it's hackable and blinky. About the Badge render of boards Electronic badges are becoming more common, but after what ever conference they were procured at, they often quickly find their way to a drawer or wall hook and are not ever used again. I wanted to design a badge that was useful long-term and wouldn't end up gathering dust. As I was trying to figure out what to design for this badge, I noticed that I kept using one tool on my work bench, my bus pirate. For those who don't know this tool, designed by Dangerous Prototypes,it has a myriad of features as follows: 0-5.5volt tolerant pins 0-6volt measurement probe 1Hz-40MHz frequency measurement 1kHz - 4MHz pulse-width modulator, frequency generator On-board multi-voltage pull-up resistors On-board 3.3volt and 5volt power supplies with software reset Macros for common operations Bus traffic sniffers (SPI, I2C) A bootloader for easy firmware updates Transparent USB->serial mode 10Hz-1MHz low-speed logic analyzer Servo driver Can program many AVR microcontrollers (Supported by AVRdude/Can emulate the AVR STK500 v2 with alternate ST500 Clone firmware ) Programs FPGAs and CPLDs with alternate XSVF firmware Scriptable from Perl, Python, etc. The community has written firmware which adds even more features. I decided to integrate the bus pirate v3.6 because it has better support from the original developers and community over the bus pirate v4 which, while newer, didn't see as great of support from the developers. The badge has a switch that can be used to physically disconnect the bus pirate from the rest of the badge or connect the bus pirate to either act as a UART bridge to the brain of the badge or get an I2C playground for learning and testing. Both the recognizer badge and identity addon are back-lit with RGB LEDs so you can hack into the badge, choose your color, and have groovy animations. The recognizer badge also features: 8x12 LED matrix display 3 buttons 3 SAO ports 2 Minibadge ports USB micro-b port 2xAA batteries #WifiCactus I've also collaborated with @d4rkm4tter to bring you this #wificactus SAO which will work with any badge that supports the new SAO 1.69 standard. Final board render Who am I? I am a computer science and electrical engineering technology student. I have designed a couple of addons for SAINTCON and decided I wanted to design my own indie badge for DEF CON 27. End of line."

We're funded, so here's what happens if go even higher! $2000 Everyone gets hard cover copies of the the book instead of softbound. $2500 Everyone gets a bonus print from Angela and a Foxy lanyard to wear at work or conventions. The Project Scott and Angela have produced a gorgeous and spooky book. It's about a very wise fox who doesn't believe in ghosts even when they are chasing him. If you like the Adams Family or know what happens if you say Beetlejuice three times, you'll feel right at home. We've been showing this book at conventions and fairs for several months now and everyone loves the art. Angela did amazing work and we can't wait for you to see it. Timeline We love this book, and guess what? The book is already finished! We just need to print it and send it into your hands so you can love it too. We expect to be printed and shipped before the end of September. Plenty of time for Halloween and Christmas. Reward levels that include a bonus print by Angela are marked for Delivery in early October. Just to be safe as the print will be new and we want it done right. But we expect it to be done and shipped in September as well. The long term plan is after the kickstarter success, in October at the earliest, the book will be available for purchase online at places like Amazon and Barnes & Noble. You will already have your copy by then, and if you live in the continental US, you didn't pay for shipping or tax. That was on us. Reading Level The words are suitable for a 4th grade reading level, and we figure nine and up is a good range for scary stories. If your child is brave enough for ghost stories, they will be more than ready. Younger kids may love it too, but they'll need someone to read it to them. Current Cover Design Bah! Restarts! Money!

For more than a decade Lost Battalion Games, has been remembering the allied invasion of Normandy. We want to share our love of the history and our appreciation of the sacrifice of ordinary men called to acts of true valor and courage. The D-Day invasion battle was a stage where perfect execution by the British 6th Airborne division was contrasted by amazing improvisation by the American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions. The Landing at Utah beach was executed generally according to plan. But �Bloody Omaha� beach and the raiding forces like Point du Hoc had to adapt to confusion and disorder. Sometimes coming ashore while in the wrong place, faced with stiff resistance from Axis forces. In all, D-Day was tragic and triumphant. We want to allow you to remember this great battle with us, while sharing a game of cards with family and friends. How Can You Help? First off please spread the word through posting on Facebook, history blogs, reddit pages, game forums or any other platform where you have an established presence and voice. Lend us your voice. Our project is first and foremost about remembering those who fought in D-Day. We do that through stories and games shared with our family and friends. Support us in any of these backer levels: D-Day 75th Anniversary Backer - $10 USD You will receive a copy of the D-Day 75th Anniversary Bridge Size playing card deck. Share the Memories Backer - $250 USD You will receive a case (30 decks) of D-Day 75th Anniversary Bridge Size playing card decks. Customize the Illustration and Memorandum My Uncle Fought Backer - $350 USD We will illustrate one card using a photograph of your ""Uncle"" (or any family or friend). You must have a photograph of your ""Uncle"" for which you own the copyright or is in the public domain. We will use this as a guide for the artist to do a custom illustration of a single card - for example, the 2 of Hearts. Your custom card will be included in each deck of your reward. Reward is a case of 30 decks. D-Day Legacy Backer - $1000 USD You can replace one illustration in the deck that everyone gets, with a custom illustration and two line text memorandum. Our artist will exercise creative license to enshrine the moment you wish to commemorate. We will use your photograph as a guide for the artist to do a custom illustration of a single card. You will also be able to choose which of the remaining cards in the deck will feature your custom illustration. This will be selected in backer order. You will receive a case containing 30 decks of D-Day 75th Anniversary edition cards. Custom Illustration and Memorandum Our good friend Tom Burman from Sergeants: Day of Days. The above example was done for a Vietnam era veteran that served in the 101st Airborne. We did this because of his avid play and support for our Sergeants: Miniatures Game. For backers of ""Legacy"" and ""My Uncle Fought"" levels this is the way we convert your photograph into a production illustration. We have done many of these for veterans and museums. Please join us in remembering the valor of these men. Moments in Time Time, Force and Memorandum Each card in the deck commemorates a moment in time on D-Day.

Now, my eyes are set on a new adventure film that promises the same thrills and action of a roller-coaster ride -- OPERATION CAVITY. 'Write what you know.' That's the traditional wisdom that screenwriting gurus tell aspiring filmmakers when they're searching for ideas to create. However, I took a bit of a different approach, 'Write what you fear.' I began developing this project four years ago after shooting my last award-winning short film, Hi-Glow Retro. The concept focuses on a boy and his fear of the dentist. Growing up, that boy was me. test footage Maybe I can blame myself for having a mouthful of cavities from a diet of sour candies or that time the orthodontist shaved down my front teeth so that they were perfectly flat-edge. Whatever it may be, I know this -- in the eyes of a kid, going to the dentist can be terrifying. Syringes. Drills. Pliers. Now, throw in my love for great action films and we have OPERATION CAVITY. test footage WHAT IS OPERATION CAVITY? This is a heist film. Think Stranger Things meets Ocean's 11. Or for the older crowd think 1980s-style adventure, like what Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment started off creating. Operation Cavity is an unusual coming-of-age story that follows 11 year-old Douglas Maroney as he plots to rob the dentist who traumatized his childhood. test footage When Douglas complains to his friends about his dentist, keeping a tooth that he extracted from him � he soon discovers that he�s not the only one. In fact, they realize that the dentist has a secret collection that he�s been building over the years. Douglas and his friends are inspired to plot an elaborate heist to steal back their teeth from the Dentist and sell it to younger students on the 'black market' at school for tooth fairy money. Fast. Action. High-Stakes. This is a bank job. There�s never a dull moment on this roller-coaster ride. As any good film, there are some comedic moments, but this isn�t a comedy � these kids want their teeth back. Each shot will push the narrative or introduce a new piece of information to help our viewers follow along. Think Hell or High Water, Die Hard, Jurassic Park, Sicario, Ocean�s 11, Baby Driver, Overlord, and Goodfellas. test footage THE A-TEAM In order to successfully pull off a heist, you need a highly-skilled group of craftsmen -- Mountain-Movers. Can-Doers. Punctual. Creative. These humans below are seasoned professionals, the Avengers of filmmaking. Alex on-set with his #1 fan WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY MONEY? Our last film, Hi-Glow Retro, proved that we could produce a compelling and striking film inexpensively. Four years later, we have grown tremendously as filmmakers and have gained tons of experience. Now we want to step up our game, but we need your help. We've already invested a significant amount of our own resources and will be receiving no pay for this shoot. The budget we're asking for is what we need to get everything else done: from craft services to the custom design and creating a denture for the surgery scene. From start to finish, from production to post, you will be making this film happen. And it will be epic. We hope to encourage supporters of independent film to participate in this production from the very beginning. We want to involve you (the audience) in this adventure, as well as give you opportunities to share in the success of the film. Alex and the team prepare for liftoff. BUDGET GAME PLAN As soon as we�ve successfully funded this project, we�ll immediately move into production. We�ve already began pre-production work (location scouting, scheduling and more), and selecting key cast and on-boarding crew members (and you). But to officially attach these professionals, we first need to complete funding. We plan to shoot for four days in Early August 2019 in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Our goal is to premiere at film festivals in the Spring of 2020. This project is a proof of concept for a TV series that Alex is currently developing. Alex directing a commercial for Unilever in Myanmar. REWARDS The poster has not yet been created but it will be similar to this poster for Hi-Glow Retro or better! Silvermine's 'Make Mountains Move' T-Shirt Festival Premieres! As an Executive Producer, you'll join us on the red carpet. Alex and producers at the Connecticut premiere of Hi-Glow Retro WHY KICKSTARTER? I have helped four Kickstarter campaigns raise close to a million dollars through the videos I have created over the past seven years. Among the most successful campaigns were EMBR Wave, a campaign that reached $629,856 from a $100,000 goal and Daniel's, which raised $243,918 from a $25,000 goal. I have witnessed the influence that Kickstarter has in helping creators find supporters for their projects and now I am hoping to find those supporters for my own passion project, Operation Cavity. WHY SHOULD I CARE? Alex is a sought after director known for creating distinctive worlds with emotional storytelling, strong characters and a very cinematic visual style. Operation Cavity is his most ambitious project yet and will surely be the best. Why not be involved in creating something epic? Below are some of Alex's greatest hits (including Hi-Glow Retro above): THANK YOU Thank you for reading about OPERATION CAVITY! This project is very important to us and we are excited to share it with you. Follow us on Twitter , Instagram , and Like us on Facebook Simply put, we CANNOT make this without YOU! With Kickstarter it is all or nothing. If a campaign does not reach its goal, no money is collected, no project can get made, and thus no rewards distributed.

Text: Each line is exactly 11 syllables with the exact same stressed and unstressed meter, save for a couple twists expertly crafted for literary effect. My grandma's imprint and saying ""no"" to a major publishing deal Since starting this project, I�ve connected with many amazing people in the publishing world. Two of these people asked me if they could bring my book to their publisher (one of which was a Big 5 house)! I said ""no"". Why? It�s important for me to publish my first book under my grandmother�s imprint. My grandma fought to be a part of the boys club of business and I'm not going to let her down! We've dotted our ""i""s, crossed our ""t""s, and are ready to print! We�ve been certified by the leading crowdfunding logistics partner to ensure we understand the complexities of fulfillment, we have a sound logistics plan, and we know exactly how to reliably and cost-effectively get our books into your kids� hands. We�ve also partnered with an Independent Publishing Collective so that we can band together with others in order to get the same discounted rates that the big publishing houses get. The funds raised here will go entirely towards printing, shipping, credit card processing, and other fees associated with production and fulfillment (The resurrection of my grandmother's imprint and working with industry professionals to create the book itself has already been funded separately). My daily inspiration and my larger mission This big-hearted boy below likes to wear skirts and dresses sometimes... and he rocks the color pink. In the Victorian Era, all young boys wore dresses (and often had long hair) and in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries pink was considered the most suitable color for boys (while blue, of course, was for girls). I bring this up to put into perspective the sheer randomness of our society's ""rules"". I desperately want to shine a light on the arbitrary, to normalize the abnormal, and to do my part to increase the declining levels of empathy in our world. This book is about being true to oneself, despite societal pressures that dictate how one ""should"" behave or what (or even whom!) one ""should"" like. As such, after this crowdfunding campaign is complete and we're able to go to print, a portion of the profits from each book that's eventually sold on Amazon will be donated to an amazing LGBTQ charity that helps create safe-spaces for kids of all gender expressions in as many schools as possible. Here's what you've all been waiting for! In addition to the book itself, here are a few other fun rewards you can get! Discounts & Freebies :) With each additional book you order, you get increasingly more significant discounts plus more free rewards! With multiple copies on hand, you'll always have the perfect gift for the next baby shower or kids birthday party. #Winning. Plus, research shows that spending money on others makes us happier than saving money or spending money on ourselves. So get your happy on :) The Rewards Included Up Close & Personal We're working with a group of amazing educators and empathy researchers to build out our discussion guide as well as a short, fun, and interactive empathy workshop. Then, on June 21st, we'll be testing this out with a group of almost 30 4-7 year olds! In addition to the reading and workshop, you'll be able to have a personal chat with the author about anything from empathy research to starting a publishing company to going heli-skiing ;) This reward tier also includes a special thank-you to you, in ink, in the book itself! Personalized Poem & Portrait This is a Kicstarter exclusive and will not be available after this campaign. Send us a picture of a loved one and some details about them and we'll create a personalized portrait and poem. This will be framed to make the perfect gift! Shipping Rates by Country Our warehouse is located in the US. As such, we're able to offer free shipping across the entire United States. At a loss to us, we will offer $5 flat rate shipping to Canada and $10 flat rate shipping to the rest of the world. Since we have Canadian roots, we figured we'd also offer a free pick-up option in a couple major Canadian cities. If you're interested in that, you'll be able to let us know via the survey at the end. You'll be required to pay for shipping up front but we'll hand you back your $5 in cash upon pick-up. You may even be able to have a spot of tea with the author or her mom! We may be able to arrange for free pick-up locations in other countries/cities as well. This will depend on the volume of orders from each region and whether or not we know people traveling there :) Cute toddler pictured above not included. Unless you're offering up childcare... Timeline You can expect to receive your digital rewards in July and your physical rewards in September (We�re aware that some educators may require their books in August. If this is the case for you, let us know via the survey at the end and we can arrange for expedited shipping. We�re happy to waive the additional shipping fees if enough copies are purchased.) Readings/Workshops will be scheduled in July, via the survey, and slots will be available throughout the school year, starting in September."

Learning the game is easy, and it is enjoyable to play without mastering any of the deep strategies. Of course, it is all the more fun as you learn the strategic plays that appear unwise and end up paying off in the end. The Tuxtla deck has five suits of cards numbered 1 through 10. Each round takes less than 10 minutes to play and is fast paced. A game is won when a player reaches a total of 15 points. Most games last under 30 minutes. The beta version of the deck has been fully designed and tested for playability and for quality of materials. This Kickstarter campaign will fund the final steps of production and distribution of the game. As we exceed our funding goal we will go into our second design plan for the cards, moving from a caricature to a more realistic image for each card. We will also move up from a plain box to customized or even to a custom tin box. About Call Family Games The Call Family grew up playing games. Each holiday, family event, and many evenings are spent around the game table. Grandpa says that game playing allowed his children to learn ""how to lose without being losers"". Relationships are strengthened, self image improved, and education enhanced through game play. Interpersonal relationships skills are refined. And most importantly, games are fun. A number of years ago we started vetting out ideas for new games that should be marketed, culling the best aspects of the games we love most and creating fun, family oriented games. We have so many exciting projects to start, but we realize that we need to get significant experience under our belts before we move on to some of the more involved games. We decided to launch Tuxtla as our first game precisely because it is so well tested (we have played it for years) and because we can set a very low funding level for our first offering. As we continue to gain experience we will refine and then offer future projects through Kickstarter. We are excited for this first launch!"

In order to get the gold you need, you will have to turn to the wealthiest - and most dangerous! - individual you know... The Dragon! In Jesse Li's Dragon's Interest, you will be the leader of one of these kingdoms, and it will be up to you to outbid, out maneuver, and out play your opponents to reign supreme. You will borrow gold from the draconian loan shark on the mountain to finance your improvements, but you will need to make sure you have ample reserves on hand when the Dragon comes calling, because if you can't pay her back, she will take out her anger on you and your kingdom, laying waste to all you hold dear! Dragon's Interest has players competing with economic engines that they will create in their kingdoms. They will collect gold and knights and knowing when to spend or save those resources will be the tightrope they will need to walk. Dragon's Interest modifies and enhances the original mechanisms found in Ponzi Scheme to allow players to bluff their opponents and engage in secret bidding wars as they try to stay one step ahead of their opponents, and of course their scaly loan shark. Only the player who does the best job in rebuilding a large and diverse Kingdom will come out on top in this mid-weight Euro style strategy game! At the start of each round, you will bid interest payment values for your loan from the dragon. The more interest you're willing to pay, the better your selection of loan value and building type. Take turns activating buildings. Gain resources based on how many of a particular building you have, then make secret offers to others (based on the type of building you activated) for buildings and resources. Be careful- if your offer is too low, it may backfire on you! At the end of the round, the Dragon will move at least one space around the mountain. Whichever building type she passes dictates which building projects owe interest to her - payable immediately! Sometimes new building tiles revealed in the center will indicate that she should be moved more than one space, or that other events should trigger. Click on the banner above to read the rules to Dragon's Interest! At $30,000, we will add a King and Dragon Meeple to the game to take the place of their cardboard counterparts. At $45,000 we will add a Mountain Meeple for your Dragon to circle, as well as stickers for all the meeples - your Knights, King, Dragon, and Mountain that was just unlocked. At $60,000, we will add a cloth lining into the Premium Magnetic Box so your Knights and Coins don't get so bruised when they are thrown into it! Dragon's Interest will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped inside a custom fitted box to ensure maximum safety when being shipped to you.. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy. What does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of the above countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you! Friendly Local Game Stores are an invaluable part of this hobby that we love, and we appreciate everything they do to bring value to the industry. TMG recognizes that the brick & mortar store is not only a place to buy games, but a location for people to enjoy their hobby with a welcoming community. The individuals who own and run game stores are some of the most informed people within the industry, and the knowledge that they have shared with TMG has proven to be most insightful. We invite all Retailers to join our Facebook Retailer Group so they can be part of the conversation between publisher and retailer, get any questions they might have answered, and be involved in future projects. The group is available now, and not just for backers. You can find it here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TMGRetailers/ Please use our TMG Retailer Facebook Group for specific pledge information for Dragon's Interest."

This innovative new brace works by decelerating rather than inhibiting your natural range-of-motion like bulky metal/material braces. Great For Any Water Sports / Wicks Away Sweat / Keeps Your Muscles Warm During Any Activity! Invented by a health professional in San Francisco who was tired of non-solutions from a stale industry. SuperSkin� rapidly came to life via design work: And testing multiple materials and manufacturing processes to achieve the quality we wanted: Various Prototypes For over a year, we've tested it across a variety of activities including running, swimming, surfing, snow sports, cycling, boxing, weight training, hiking and more. SuperSkin� provides the support you need for any activity that puts a strain on your knees!! Our product has been tested and proven to work. We've done the research, been granted our patent and trademark rights, and now want to get our product into your hands!! We've identified a few important updates we'd like to make so we can bring you the best product possible. We've done everything we can to get it this far, but now we need your backing to help us take the next step!! The process required to create the molds for SuperSkin� is extremely expensive and we can't do it without your help! Once the molds are made, we can start manufacturing at scale and ensure timely delivery to our backers!!! �The device helps stabilize my knee joint and gives me more confidence. I feel stronger when I wear it and my knee feels better even after I remove the brace. I love it and would not ski or workout without it!� One of our earliest beta testers was a 66-year-old lawyer and mother of two who enjoys being active. She suffered an initial knee injury in 2005, and pain reappeared in 2015 and persisted through 2018. Her injury included swelling of the right knee joint with sever degenerative changes including spurring, loose bone chips, and a torn meniscus. This was the worst knee pain she had felt during the course of her various injuries, to the point she was unable to walk and felt anxious. The potential for knee pain is always on her mind, and she was seeking a better solution. While working through all her rehab, she was introduced to SuperSkin� by its creator, who was also her personal trainer, in August 2018. She started wearing SuperSkin� when she was riding her bike, skiing and working out at the gym. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

The Mimic�s Grid is an innovative new tool for your tabletop - a versatile gaming surface that enables infinite world building through an impressive set of features and modular design. It's an adaptable game tile for your roleplaying sessions. Build each room on the fly with magnetic elements. Throw your minis and monsters down and they snap into place. Build hybrid environments with 2D and 3D elements or draw directly on the surface with any type of marker. FEATURES: 10� x 10� Carbon Steel Platform: Light. Durable. Square. 1� x 1� Grid: Perfect for gaming or table-based spreadsheets. Chemical Resistant Surface: A lot like Teflon, but for markers and stuff. Use any kind of marker on it, and it comes out squeaky clean. Please don't use them to cook meals (we haven't tested that functionality). Integrated Impact Frame: Keeps �em from denting and warping, even when you flip tables. Neoprene Padding: Like most discerning gamers, the Grid prefers soft butt padding for long sessions. Embedded Magnets: Lock multiple grids into place and also (probably) erase VHS tapes. 2D Magnetic Maps: Slap �em in place! Slap elements down on top of �em! Move �em! Nope - that one was a joke. They stay in place. 3D Elements: Build elaborately planned death traps and environments for your players in three glorious dimensions. Adapt your Collection: Slap our included magnets on your existing minis and terrain. Don�t be shy, they won�t mind. Here's a quick list of the features written directly on the surface of a Grid with acrylic and permanent markers: BASICALLY, IT'S ALL ABOUT MAGNETS The Grid's entire surface is steel. You can stick elements directly to it with any type of magnets, or use the adhesive magnets we've hand-picked with just the right amount of force. Miniatures, terrain, maps � even refrigerator magnets, they all stay in place. No more meticulously setting up your dungeon and having that one clumsy player, let�s call him Steve, accidentally bumping the table and knocking everything over shifting your minis out of place. You can build your maps beforehand, even with terrain and minis in place, snapping them in when the time is right! It's versatile enough to change on the fly, too - allowing you to rearrange it quickly when Steve splits the party and wanders off to a cave or something. LIGHTWEIGHT AND DURABLE We designed the Grid with portability, weight, and durability in mind. Our prototypes weigh around half of a pound each. With 28 gauge steel, each Grid is a super tough little guy that won't get squished by all those heavy books. The bottom of the Grid is soft slip-resistant neoprene which lifts the Grid away from the table and helps keep it from sliding around and scratching the surface it sits on. Inside of the steel housing is an integrated impact frame that adds rigidity protects the Grid from dents and warping, even if you drop it or, kick it, or... you know, dropkick it. Although, we don�t know why you would dropkick something so great� in fact: All of this comes together to form the Mimic�s Grid, which is small enough to carry alongside your books and other roleplaying gear, and lightweight so carting them around won�t give you a hernia. The bottom line is � we know it sucks to carry all of your gear to a game, and we set out from the start to make the Grid light and portable! OK, BUT CAN I WRITE ON IT? Yes you can. Using science magic, we applied a durable coating to the Grid that imbues it with extreme chemical and stain resistance. We call it Any-Erase - you can draw on it with ANYtype of marker, and it cleans up easily - no streaks, no stains. That makes it spill-resistant, too, if one player at your table (Steve...) is prone to horizontally aligning their beverage containers - your art and the Grid should stay safe. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Permanent marker lines stay on the Grid until you clean them with alcohol or acetone - the ink won't smudge, and won't even come off with water or other cleaning solutions. Dry erase comes off with an easy wipe, and wet erase comes off with anything that is wet. Party with your Party like you're at a 90's Rave! With UV markers on your Mimic's Grid you too can create intricate maps like you've been trapped in an underground bunker on a mysterious island: Do you have any suggestions for markers that we should test next? Let us know in the comments! ONE MORE NEAT ANY-ERASE BONUS You want another rad feature? We got you! With the specialized coating and ability to use different marker types, you can draw out something, like a dungeon or city street, with a permanent marker, and then draw various elements with dry erase.

These unique sets will be available as one of the choices for the reward tiers that include an Artist Set. Each set is 14 pieces of high-quality urethane lovingly handcrafted by good ol' Dan. I can personally attest to the fact that he had a strange grin on his face the entire time he was sculpting these beautiful pieces, probably (definitely) lost in thoughts of all of the terrible things that would befall players in between his walls. Here's what comes in the set: 2 Doors 2 Four-Inch Walls 4 Two-Inch Walls 4 Corners 2 Columns CUSTOM CARRYING CASE The Legendary Hero Box and Maps tier includes a custom oak carrying case, and we wanted to show off what we've been working on so far with some pre-production design shots. The next step is to send this off to our manufacturer for prototyping, and we'll take you all with us on that journey when the time comes! It'll be made from white oak, which gives it a kind of rough-and-tumble ""don't mess with me"" vibe that we like very much It has a metal-plated bottom, just like yer mum It uses a pretty unique hidden barrel hinging system, giving it a flush exterior The inside has magnetic plates that your Grids will snap right into We've designed to hold 12 Grids The Mimic is laser burned on the outside to show that you are a cool person with cool tastes It's got room for books and other stuff, too! Keep in mind that this is a prototype render, and some of these details may change, but the basic design is there. We hope you like it! A Special Thank You Reward We're putting together a little romp through this world we're creating around the Cursed Crypt, and we're going to be giving all of our backers the very first adventure written specifically for the Mimic's Grid. Each backer will receive a PDF copy of the adventure, which will weave the tale of the Crypt, the world it is a part of, and the colorful characters that surround it. ADD-ONS AND PLEDGE MANAGEMENT MAP & 3D ARTISTS: Our stats are pretty good, but we know when we're outmatched. That's why we've partnered with incredible artists that the community knows and loves to bring unique creations to the Mimic�s Grid with Kickstarter Exclusive maps and content! You can get your hands on these beautiful maps made by these extremely talented people on any reward tier that includes an Artist Set. We're will post spotlight updates for each one of the Featured Updates throughout the campaign, including descriptions and sample images from the Artist Sets. Each Artist Set will be up to 900 Sq. Inches, and will include a mix of Environments (full-size 10""x10"" prints), Scenes (up to 10""x10"" prints with static, unmovable elements), and Elements (things that go into Environments and Scenes, trees and furniture and stuff). The exact quantity of how much of each thing is included in the sets is up to the artists - and that information will be included in the spotlight updates! Additional Artist Sets will be available in the Add-On Marketplace. Keep an eye out for Artist Spotlight updates toward the end of our Kickstarter. We are so insanely excited about these, and we cannot wait to show what these incredible artists have in store for us.

PLEDGE MANAGEMENT: We're working with BackerKit to set up a Pledge Management System and Add-On Marketplace that will give you access to all of the accessories, maps, and other goodies that aren't a part of the regular reward tiers. You'll get your hands on extra Grids, maps, and accessories as soon as our BackerKit marketplace goes live. If you backed the Kickstarter prior to the BackerKit Add-On Marketplace launching, you'll receive an email when it goes live. We expect that to happen during the second week of the Kickstarter, and we'll post an update when it is available. QUALITY GUARANTEE: Every single Grid's steel housing is manufactured, coated, painted, finished, and sandwiched with its guts in the good ol' USA, just minutes from our office in Spokane, Washington. Like us, our manufacturers are perfectionists with high standards for quality. That's one of the main reasons we partnered with them to help bring the Mimic's Grid to life. They put each and every Grid through an intense verification process and thorough check for imperfections before it is packaged. The Mimic's Grid is our flagship product, and is representative of the quality that we hope to provide you with all of our products. It's our introduction, like a very, very square handshake that is the foundation of a long-term friendship. We hope you see it that way, too. If your Grid is defective or imperfect in any way upon delivery, we will replace it for you immediately with no questions asked - that's our guarantee. SHIPPING: These costs are still estimates, and subject to change. We're addressing high international shipping charges across the board and will keep making strides to reduce them. Everything here is based directly off of current shipping quotes. We've struck up a bargain with a dark entity comprised of a swirling, pulsating void of utter darkness that stretches to the farthest reaches of reality - but based in the EU. They will handle all of your fulfillment needs. MOST IMPORTANTLY - We are expanding our relationship with fulfillment centers in countries we haven't listed below, which should lower costs even more. All costs are estimates and are subject to change. HEY! LOOK DOWN HERE! REVISED EU-FRIENDLY SHIPPING RATES! Shipping is estimated and suject to change! COMMUNITY: We wouldn�t have had the inspiration for this project without the amazing creations of the DIY, homebrew, and creator community. You are a beacon of light and hope in a bleak world, and we appreciate everything you do. One of the most exciting things about the future of the Mimic�s Grid is YOU. We can�t wait to see all of the crazy things that you�ll do with our product � whether it is building maps at angles, or even completely upside-down, adapting your own terrain and elements in creative ways, or using the Mimic�s Grid in ways we didn�t even anticipate. We can�t wait to hear about it all. At launch, we�re going to have a system in place for featuring your wonderful creations and for overall community interaction. Grab Your Own Artifacts from the Crypt In our hearts, we are crafters and creators - that's how the Mimic's Grid was born. We know that DIY is the beating heart of the RPG community - creators sharing their designs, supplements, and art to enhance other's experiences. We pledge to embrace that state of mind and do everything we can to provide the community with the resources you need to work with the Mimic's Grid. We're going to provide you with low-cost, easy-to-use adhesive magnetic discs to adapt your creations to work with the Grid. However, we promise to never limit you to only using our products or shun you because you used other magnets! Our creative team will share our process, our games, give tips and be there to answer any questions or help out when needed. We'll provide digital versions of our Cursed Crypt created maps and art assets for free, fully licensed for non-commercial reprint. We'll work with our partners to provide a portion of their creations to you in the same manner as our content. We are going to seek out partnerships with the best artists, content creators, and crafters out there. We will strive to be open and honest with you about every move we make as a company, and, just like it has been up to this point, everything we do will be ""community-first"". Want to see your artwork or creations featured on the Mimic�s Grid? Cool, we do, too! Get involved in the process by popping over to our website and contacting us. We look forward to working with you. We�ve got big plans for the way we�re going to feature you and your creations on the Mimic's Grid! Don't be shy! Contact us today, and let's talk! ABOUT CURSED CRYPT: Cursed Crypt is an American company based in Spokane, Washington that produces tabletop game accessories and content. We�re tabletop gamers. We love creating exciting worlds and that rush you get when you crit, those long sessions spent unraveling a mystery (or sometimes long sessions spent deciding whether to go left or right � we know how it goes). We studied our play sessions and started to think of ways to improve the processes without sacrificing interactivity or immersion. We firmly believe that adding too much automation or technology to a game ultimately detracts from the experience and stifles the magic. That frame of mind led us down the road to the Mimic�s Grid � the perfect tool for enhancing immersion and playability without sacrificing emotional investment. Ok, but who are you really? We are a team of marketers, engineers, technologists, and super friends that have worked together for over two decades running comic conventions and building digital products of many shapes and sizes. We have a ton of skills and specializations that have given us a keen eye for quality and what we think people will like. Prior to Cursed Crypt the partner team built Uxiliary, a Digital Agency in Spokane Washington. Launched in 2014, Uxiliary provides technical development and design services derived from user experience research. Notable clients include Nike, Intel, Dell, Amazon, The City of Spokane, INB, FSB, BECU, Northern Quest, and many more. We have stories, you should ask. Cursed Crypt is located in Spokane, WA.

Instead of duking it out with one another, you and your friends can Slay Your Enemies instead! The Slay Your Enemies expansion ships with every copy of the game! This game mode takes what is otherwise a straightforward and quick game and transforms it into an entirely different experience. Instead of a free-for-all, this mode pits one player, known as the raid master, against all the other players who form a party of adventurers with only one thing on their mind ""Glory"". In this mode you and your friends will face seemingly endless hordes of beasts and collect mythical items along the way to aid you in your future battles. Can you and your friends traverse all five raids and come out victorious? What We Need & What You Get Right now, we are turning to you, Kickstarter, for help raising the funds that we need to publish, print, market and distribute the first run of Slay Your Friends.

Principle Dilemma is an intellectual card-based board game which aims to give each player the opportunity to use their creative thinking and moral compass to delve deeper into their own minds, thoughts, and discomforts, as well as those of their opponents. Among the many diverse groups and situations in which Principle Dilemma has been played, two constants remain: Every person learned something about themselves, and something about those they were playing with. They couldn't wait to play again. This party game for thinkers can be played seriously or just for fun. Either way, it shatters the ice in a meaningful way by providing a stage for authentic and exciting conversation between friends and strangers alike. Principle Dilemma with the hand crafted cherry wooden box. The concept is simple.

Hear what some of our play testers have to say: ""Principle Dilemma is my go-to game for just about any gathering."" - Max A. (Play tester) ""A deep dive into your mentality and decision making...I found myself enjoying the game the more I played. It was interesting to have to defend your point of view and why you would do something. I can't wait to play it again."" - Michael L. (Blind play tester & professional game designer) ""A round of Principle Dilemma left my table of friends with a genuinely heartfelt conversation about how we allow the scales of humanity to tip. This game gets straight to the point of what it�s trying to accomplish and is open ended enough to adapt to whatever needs your game group might have.� - Jennifer G.

ABOUT SIDE-KICKED Sick and tired of being taken for granted by the citizens of Chicago, ignored by the media, and disrespected by the super-heroes they worked with, the sidekicks of Chicago WENT ON STRIKE. Side-Kicked Chapter #1 - Page 23 That is the story detailed in Side-Kicked Chapters 1-4, which were successfully funded on Kickstarter in two separate campaigns. This campaign is to raise funds to print Side-Kicked Chapter 5, the First Issue in a brand new 5-issue mini-series, and the beginning of an all-new, complete story in the world of Side-Kicked. But don't worry. If you missed out on Side-Kicked Chapters 1-4 (collected in the Side-Kicked Volume #1 trade paperback) you can still get copies through this campaign. There are three Reward Tiers specifically for catching up on the story so far. $13 - Digital Catch-Up Streamlined Edition $24 - DIGITAL CATCH-UP TIER $35 - PHYSICAL CATCH-UP TIER You can also INCREASE YOUR PLEDGE at ANY PLEDGE LEVEL to add a Digital Copy of Side-Kicked Chapters 1-4 ($8) OR a Physical Copy of the Side-Kicked Volume #1 trade paperback ($20). DISCLAIMER: You don't NEED Volume 1 to understand or enjoy Chapter 5 (Side-Kicked Volume 2: Issue #1), but you will certainly have a greater experience if you've read it. Side-Kicked Volume 2 (Chapters 5-9) is a 5-issue comic book mini-series created by series writer, Russell Brettholtz. Its story picks up right where Side-Kicked Chapter 4 left off. The strike is over. The sidekicks have teamed up with some of the heroes they formerly worked with creating Chicago's first super-team. But will an alien threat destroy the new status quo the sidekicks fought so hard for? And all the while, the former sidekicks to Chicago's greatest super-villains are consolidating their own power, filling the vacuum left by the imprisonment of their former bosses. Series writer and co-creator Russell Brettholtz (that's me) has already finished scripting the entirety of Chapters 5-9. Sales from the Volume 1 trade paperback produced enough profit that the artwork for Chapter 5 is paid for, but I will still need help with printing costs. Having physical copies of issues of Side-Kicked to sell provides me with the necessary money to continue paying my art team to produce this series (and reduce the funding goals for future Kickstarter campaigns to create Chapters 6-9). Once the artwork for all of Chapters 5-9 is complete, I will be able to present the new, complete series to Darby Pop (publisher of the Side-Kicked Volume #1 trade paperback) for consideration for greater publication. Side-Kicked Volume 2: Issue #1 (Chapter 5) Cover 1A - by Dustin Collins (Standard Cover) Who Will Love Side-Kicked? Fans of Side-Kicked Volume 1 (Seriously.

Collectors looking for limited print run books and great artwork. Supporters of independent comics who want to see what the comic book world has to offer beyond the BIG 2.

What Are People Saying About Side-Kicked? Side-Kicked Volume 1 Trade Paperback (collecting Chapters 1-4) ""You should pick up this book - its heart is in the right place... and yours will be in your throat!"" - Michael Zapcic (Comic Book Men) ""Brettholtz�s deadpan comedy allows few breaks for the sidekicks throughout, tapping into the down-on-their-luck wave (think Hawkeye or Ant-Man) that has proven to be a winning formula in the last few years. The series is worth a look if you are keen to venture outside the mainstream capes."" - Jeff Marsick (Newsarama) ""4 out of 5 Stars"" - Richard Vasseur (firstcomicsnews.com) ""Check out Side-Kicked - You'll be glad you did!"" - Ed Garrett (tmstash.com) ""I hope there�s a sequel."" - (Don't Read My Blog) Meet the Creative Team Writer: Russell Brettholtz Russell Brettholtz started reading comic books at the age of eight, when his grandmother gave him an Archie. At twelve he graduated to the X-Men which he collected for over twenty years. Russell�s road to writing comics began with X-Men fan-fiction in high school and college, and finally a story submission to Marvel (it was not published). When he realized that finding an artist and self-publishing were realistic possibilities thanks to the internet, Russell put serious effort into creating his own comic book. Side-Kicked was his first full length comic book with original characters. The Volume 1 (Chapters 1-4) trade paperback sold out of its initial Darby Pop Publishing printing and is well on its way to selling out of its second edition, as well. Russell lives in New York�s capital region with his wife and two daughters. Penciler: Andrey Portilla Andrey Portilla is a Colombian comic book artist and illustrator. He discovered his interest for comic books at the age of 14 when he bought his first Spawn. Marveled by the art of Greg Capullo, he began to copy his drawings and set a goal to someday reach the same level of success as him. Andrey made his professional studies in graphic design, but abandoned them soon after realizing that his course was deviating from his goal that was to draw and to live comics. From there, Andrey began to work for publishers in his native country, drawing textbooks and children's books, later beginning to work with comic projects for comic book publishers and indie authors. Andrey also worked on storyboard, character design and concept art. In his spare time, he likes to write stories, paint, read manga and draw his own comics. His previous works include Knight�s Legacy: Awakening of the Pen Ddraig (Heroic Tendencies Studios) and Dragon Tamers (Bronco Ink Publishing). Inker: Quepler Pirchiner Quepler Pirchiner is a 23 years old, comic book inker and colorist. He graduated in Graphic Design from Est�cio de S� University Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and has published works for the North American and Brazilian markets. One of his most recent works was for John Daniel Taylor IV�s, 3 CORPS (Top Secret Press). Colorist: Colin Patrick Moore Colin Patrick Moore is an artist and colorist based out of Portland, Oregon. His color work can be found with publishers like Dynamite and IDW, as well as in a wide variety of indie markets. His art can also be found in the webcomic, River City. Letterer: HdE HdE has been lettering comic books since 2010, having slapped fonts down on books published by Source Point Press, Attic Studios, Dark Horse, Darby Pop, Aspen Comics and Devil's Due Publishing. He also writes and presents 'HdE's Totally Unoriginal Gaming Show' on YouTube, an acclaimed but under-watched show in which he examines video games from every era. Side-Kicked Volume 2: Issue #1 (Chapter 5) Cover 1D - by Nikkol Jelenic (Limited to 100 copy print run)) What is the Money For? Comic books are expensive to make. The artwork for a single issue can easily cost between $4,000 and $5,000 dollars (or more). In order to raise the money to pay my art team I have sold off large portions of my personal comic book collection, attended comic book conventions to sell copies of Side-Kicked Volume 1, and ran two successful Kickstarter campaigns. I now have enough cash to cover the art costs for Side-Kicked Volume 2: Issue #1 (Chapter 5). The $3,000 Goal amount represents the money I will need to pay for printing costs for the physical copies of the comic and mini-prints, and packaging/shipping costs. I am not keeping any money for myself. This campaign is all about the production of the comic. A successful campaign means I will have new product to bring to conventions to sell and continue to save funds toward the artwork for the next issue. Check Out This Four Page Teaser! Page 10 Page 11 Page 12 Page 13 What Rewards Are Available? How Will Your Books Be Packaged? All comics will be individually bagged with boards. Backers at the $15 Print Edition Reward Tier will have their books shipped in ULINE Stay-Flat envelopes. All Backers at Physical Reward Tiers above $15 will have their books shipped in Gemini Comic Supply Flash Mailers. Original Art will be secured in hard plastic top-loaders, sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard in a large bubble mailer. I will be handling fulfillment, personally, so any problems can be directed straight to me and I can fix your problem without delay. (True Story: Months after my last campaign ended and the rewards had been shipped I got an e-mail from a backer. He told me that he never received his comics. I immediately put together a new package for him, drove it to the post office the next day, and he received his books just a few days later. Nearly a year later, his original package was returned to me, having apparently spent several months in a Houston sorting facility. Crazy) THANK YOU Thank you for taking the time to explore my Kickstarter campaign. Any contribution you can make to this project is greatly appreciated (and if you can't do it with money, consider helping by spreading the word). If you decide to become a Backer, please consider leaving a Comment letting me know where you heard about this project (Facebook, Twitter, Website Forum, a Friend, My mom, etc...). Marketing a comic book campaign for Kickstarter is very difficult and time consuming. Any information on what worked will help tremendously in the future. Thank you!"

Shakespeare: community members pitching in to put on an actor-produced collaboration for the West Marin Community. With your pledge, you are purchasing admission to the show - as always, KIDS are FREE!! For the origin story, read below: --- Mother's Day, 2015: the week prior I had just completed my humble first foray into self-producing a small theatre performance in West Marin. In my post-show doldrums, I told my husband that as a Mother's Day gift, I wanted to go and check out the site of an old and never-used amphitheater space in Inverness that was supposedly hidden on the grounds of St. Columba�s Episcopal Church. Told to me previously with mythical reverence, this alleged location on Sir Francis Drake Blvd. was imprinted in his early memories when he attended his brothers� middle school graduation there. A beautiful spot � but nobody uses it! Their Sunday service had just gotten out when we pulled into their driveway. Eventually a kindly lady approached what must have looked like a really strange couple tangled in the overgrown and dried out vegetation wandering the church property. When we asked, we were told that yes indeed there was an amphitheater buried in the weeds, and that they would love to revitalize it, but did not have the resources or people with the skills and machinery to get such a project going. At that moment, I realized what I needed to do. No question about it. I immediately started discussions with the rector and church members and we all agreed: this place will get cleaned up and restored and I will produce a play there in three months� time~! The amphitheater at St. Columba�s was designed and built in 1965 by Jack Mason (1911-1985), the beloved West Marin historian, writer and retired newspaper editor with deep roots in Inverness. It was built to host the West Marin Music Festival and for years gifted the Inverness hills with wafted symphonic works as well as opera! After a few wonderful years, the Festival changed venues and the amphitheater area became neglected. It lapsed back into a wild land with the plywood platform stage and most of the long bench seating turning back into earth. Our first crowdfunding effort was successful, as were the subsequent ones and I am proud to say that several in the town have already referred to the annual Shakespeare plays there as a �West Marin Tradition�. This gorgeous spot is directly across from Tomales Bay and sits on a gently up-sloping meadow, providing an idyllic atmosphere for picnicking and play-watching. With great thanks to Fr. Vincent Pizzuto, PhD., the Bishop's Committee and the congregants of St. Columba's, I am preparing for the fifth production at the site. Thank you to all who have supported so enthusiastically and generously the previous plays: Much Ado About Nothing, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night and The Taming of the Shrew. With this year's cast and artistic team, including David Abrams as Director, As You Like It is looking to be another fantastic show! Performances will be August 24, 25; August 31, Sept. 1 & 2 at 4pm. Your pledge reward will grant you admission. No need to choose which date at the time of pledging. Thank you for your support! Sharron"

We are simply asking if our friends and their friends, along with complete strangers we don't even know yet, would want to be part of doing something great.

The Naghash Ensemble's New CD & Book ""Songs of Exile - Volume III: Lamentations & Benedictions"" THE MUSIC We're a group of seven musicians from Armenia who play new music based on texts by the little-known 15th century Armenian mystic poet and priest Mkrtich Naghash. We're very excited to be working on the 3rd and final CD of the ""Songs of Exile"" trilogy. Our music combines the earthy spirituality of Armenian folk song with new classical music, contemporary post-minimalism and the energy of jazz and rock. The ensemble features 3 brilliant female vocalists and some of Armenia's finest instrumentalists on duduk, oud, dhol and piano. ""East meets West and antiquity meets modernity in this collection of ruminations, lamentations and incantations. Highly intriguing yet accessible.""�NPR THE TEXTS Mkrtich Naghash was a highly regarded Armenian poet and priest with a large following in muslim-ruled Diyarbakir. For many years he got along with the local authorities until he built a new church for his flock with a steeple that was higher than any of the local mosques. Naghash was told to take the steeple down but he refused. He was forced into exile and when he died all he left behind were 15 poems. These texts, written in an ancient form of Armenian, are a profound meditation on man's relationship to God from the perspective of a monk forced to live in exile for many years. ""Composer John Hodian brings the poems of the 15th century Armenian priest Mkrtich Naghash to life. The songs are unmistakably Armenian, but out of this world."" �Armenisch-Deutsche Korrespondenz IN PERFORMANCE While there is no replacing being at a live concert, we live in a video age, so if you have never heard The Naghash Ensemble before you might want to check out some excerpts from one of our recent shows in Belgium. VOLUME III OF THE TRILOGY This new CD will complete the ""Songs of Exile"" Trilogy. The music features new instruments, new sounds and a much broader emotional range. The opening track is a heartfelt lament on the death of Naghash's own son and is over 30 minutes long! We are still working on the recording but we have been performing excerpts of this piece at some of our concerts. Here is a sneak preview from a recent performance: A CD AND BOOK! All of our recordings come with a beautifully designed full color book with the poems, essays and liner notes translated into English, German, French and of course Armenian! We have really pulled out all the stops for this final CD/Book package and we're excited for you to have it. Please help us bring this project to life by making a pledge of whatever amount you are comfortable with. All of our work depends on the generosity of individual backers like you! THANK YOU!

THE STORY OF THE NAGHASH ENSEMBLE The idea for The Naghash Ensemble came to me when I was living in Armenia. I was exploring the ancient temple of Garni, when suddenly I heard the most amazing sound. It was the voice of Hasmik Bhagdasaryan singing medieval Armenian spiritual music and I was completely mesmerized. This sound instantly became part of my own musical DNA and I knew I had to create new music for this incredible voice. Discovering the Texts I began to search for texts that would fit this new mystic, rhythmic, ecstatic sound in my head. After several years researching in the libraries of New York, Berlin and Yerevan, I came across a small fragment of text by the little known medieval Armenian poet and priest, Mkrtich Naghash. Naghash's words leapt off the page into my soul. ""We are all exiles brother. No one has a homeland. We are bound together, the afterlife is our homeland.� �Mkrtich Naghash These poems are profound meditations on the vagaries of living a life in exile, a concept that is very important to many Armenians. As a descendent of Armenian Genocide survivors, I have always been aware of the atrocities of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. More than 1.5 million Armenians were either exterminated or sent on death marches. The few who survived, were eventually scattered around the globe. While written hundreds of years ago, Naghash's words are, sadly, just as relevant today in light of what is happening to many peoples throughout the world who are victims of violence and prejudice. REWARDS There are some truly wonderful premiums at all different levels of support. Varant Kandilian is Armenia's preeminent designer and he has outdone himself this time in creating both a beautiful book/CD package but also special rewards for our kickstarter contributors. This is the first time we will be offering Naghash Ensemble T-Shirts and even coffee mugs! The Naghash Ensemble Coffee Mugs The Naghash Ensemble T-Shirts OUR KICKSTARTER We launched a kickstarter 4 years ago when we created ""Songs of Exile - Volume II"" and we were profoundly moved by the level of support. One of the greatest rewards of doing a fundraising campaign (aside from being able to finish the project!) is meeting new people who hear the music of The Naghash Ensemble for the first time. Please share this link with anyone you think might be interested; Music lovers, Audiophiles, Medieval Poetry Freaks, Armenians & Non-Armenians.. EVERYBODY! THANK YOU!

Das Naghash Ensemble aus Armenien: ""Songs of Exile, Volume III � Lamentations & Benedictions"" (CD & Buch) DIE MUSIK Wir sind sieben Musiker aus Armenien und spielen neue Musik, die auf den Gedichten des mittelalterlichen armenischen Dichters und Priester Mkrtich Naghash basiert. In diesem Moment arbeiten wir an der dritten und letzten CD unserer �Songs of Exile�-Trilogie. Unsere Musik verbindet die Spiritualit�t armenischer Volksmusik mit neuer Klassik, zeitgen�ssischem Postminimalismus und der Energie von Jazz und Rock. Das Ensemble vereint drei brillante S�ngerinnen und einige der besten Instrumentalisten Armeniens an Duduk, Oud, Dhol und Fl�gel. �In dieser ber�hrenden Sammlung von Gedichten, Klagen und Beschw�rungen begegnen sich Osten und Westen, Mittelalter und Moderne.� NPR Mkrtich Naghash war ein hoch angesehener armenischer Dichter und Priester mit einer gro�en Gemeinde in der muslimisch regierten Stadt Diyarbakir. Nachdem er jahrelang friedlich mit der lokalen Regierung ausgekommen war, geriet er in Schwierigkeiten, als er eine neue Kirche f�r seine Gemeinde baute, denn der Kirchturm war h�her als die st�dtischen Minarette. Naghash wurde aufgefordert, den Kirchturm abzurei�en, doch er weigerte sich. Schlie�lich wurde er gezwungen, ins Exil zu gehen. Als er starb, waren das einzige, was er hinterlie�, 15 Gedichten. Diese mittelarmenischen Texte sind ergreifende Meditationen �ber die Beziehung des Menschen zu Gott aus der Perspektive eines Mannes, der gezwungen war, viele Jahre seines Lebens im Exil zu verbringen. �Komponist John Hodian erweckt die Gedichte des armenischen Priesters und Dichters Mkrtich Naghash aus dem 15. Jahrhundert zu neuem Leben. Die St�cke sind unverkennbar armenisch und zugleich wie nicht von dieser Welt.� Armenisch-Deutsche Korrespondenz LIVE IN CONCERT Ein Konzertbesuch l�sst sich durch nichts ersetzen � und doch leben wir in einem Zeitalter von Videos. Wenn Du das Naghash Ensemble also noch nie live erlebt hast, h�r rein: VOLUME III DER TRILOGIE Die neue CD �Songs of Exile, Volume III: Lamentations & Benedictions� bedient sich neuer Kl�nge und Instrumente � zu den Blasinstrumenten Duduk und Zurna gesellen sich jetzt Schvi, Pku und Blul, und die Perkussion an Dhol und Dumbek wird erweitert durch eine massiv-kraftvolle Capol-Dhol. Die emotionale Bandbreite der Musik ist nun gr��er als je zuvor. Das Er�ffnungsst�ck ist ein Lamento �ber den Tod von Naghashs Sohn � musikalisch spiegelt sich darin ein ganzes Leben wider, umgesetzt in mehr als 30 Minuten ergreifender Musik. Wir arbeiten zwar noch an den Aufnahmen f�r die CD, haben aber Ausz�ge aus diesem St�ck bereits bei einigen Konzerten gespielt. Hier siehst Du einen Live-Mitschnitt aus Belgien: CD & BUCH Zu jeder CD des Naghash Ensembles erh�ltst Du ein liebevoll gestaltetes Begleitbuch. Darin findest Du die �bersetzungen der Gedichte, auf denen die Musik basiert, sowie Essays �ber Mkrtich Naghash und das Naghash Ensemble � alles auf Deutsch, Englisch, Franz�sisch und Armenisch! F�r unsere neue CD und das Begleitbuch haben wir keine M�hen gescheut: Wir haben einen gro�artigen Designer und wunderbare �bersetzer versammelt � und nat�rlich einige der besten Musiker Armenien. Aber die Studioaufnahmen, das Abmischen, das Drucken der B�cher und das Pressen der CDs kosten viel Geld. Deshalb brauchen wir Deine Unterst�tzung. Hilf uns, die �Songs of Exile, Volume III� Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen! Jeder Beitrag z�hlt. DANKE! DIE GESCHICHTE DES NAGHASH ENSEMBLES Die Idee f�r das Naghash Ensemble kam mir, als ich in Armenien lebte. Ich erkundete gerade den antiken Tempel in Garni, als ich pl�tzlich wundersch�ne Kl�nge vernahm. Es war die Stimme der Sopranistin Hasmik Baghdasaryan, die mittelalterliche armenische Sakralmusik sang � und ich war wie hypnotisiert. Dieser Klang wurde augenblicklich Teil meiner musikalischen DNA und ich wusste, dass ich ihn in meiner eigenen Musik auf neue Weise nutzen wollte. Die Entdeckung der Texte In meinem Kopf begann ich, eine mystische, sehr rhythmische, geradezu ekstatische Musik zu h�ren. Jetzt fehlte nur noch der richtige Text, den ich daf�r vertonen konnte. Nach jahrelanger Suche in den Bibliotheken New Yorks, Berlins und Jerewans stie� ich schlie�lich auf ein Fragment des wenig bekannten mittelalterlichen Dichters und Priester Mkrtich Naghash. Seine Worte sprangen von der Seite direkt in meine Seele. �Wir alle sind Fremde, o Br�der, niemand hat Heimat. Wir alle m�ssen gehen, allein das Jenseits ist uns Heimat.� Mkrtich Naghash Diese Gedichte sind ergreifende Meditationen �ber das Dasein in der Fremde und die Beziehung des Menschen zu Gott. F�r viele Armenier ist dieses Konzept des Exils noch heute von gro�er Bedeutung. Als Enkel von �berlebenden des Genozids an den Armeniern hatte ich fr�h erfahren, was sich Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts im Osmanischen Reich ereignet hatte: Mehr als 1,5 Millionen Armenier waren ermordet oder auf Todesm�rsche geschickt worden und die wenigen �berlebenden hatten Zuflucht im Exil gesucht. Angesichts dessen, was heute in Syrien und anderen Regionen der Welt geschieht, ist es traurig und bemerkenswert, wie relevant Naghashs Gedichte immer noch sind. UNSER KICKSTARTER Vor vier Jahren haben wir unsere erste Kickstarter-Kampagne gestartet, um die ""Songs of Exile - Volume II"" aufzunehmen.

Lyra Lyra, inspired by the rhombus shaped constellation of the same name, is a unique morphing EDC knife with the design goal of creating the smallest closed knife possible while still providing a full four finger grip. This is our second morphing knife design and incorporates all of the lessons learned on our first project, the ambitious Eclipse morphing knife, of which we produced over 5000 units. The Lyra is a step up in every way from our first design, incorporating better materials, better finishes, and blade steel. There is much more intricate machining involved in this knife and the complexity of the design along with its unique opening mechanism and shape lend for a really interesting and usable show piece. Despite its creative looks it is in fact a very ergonomic and usable EDC knife. Mechanism The unique four bar mechanism to open the Lyra is also what gives it its best feature. On a standard folding knife the handle must be the same length as the blade or vice versa. This is a limitation to nano blade knives because generally the handle is equally as small. Most nano sized knives only offer a 1 or 2 finger grip which limits them to very low force cutting tasks. The Lyra does not have this issue. Its closed length is a mere 2� but when opened it has a full 3.2� length handle (4.7"" total open length). This allows for a full 4 finger grip, something rarely seen on a nano sized knife and a true no compromises solution! Grip The benefit of the linkage extension of the Lyra�s handle is apparent by all of the different grips available. The linkages were shaped to create smooth transitions from the handle to the blade and avoid creating any �hot spots� or pressure points when gripping the knife firmly. The result is a secure, comfortable, versatile handle that allows for long periods of continuous use and offering a number of useful grip options to accommodate any task: Blade The Lyra has an excellent blade. It�s a Wharncliffe shaped blade which is designed for utility use. It is has a scoop along the top edge that adds a cool style to the blade shape but also acts as an ergonomic finger rest for better control of the blade for better precision in cutting tasks. The best feature of this blade, however, is that it is made of super hard D2 tool steel which is one of the absolute hardest and most durable blade steels available having a hardness of 61 HRC. The blade is made from a thick 0.120 inch (3mm) stock so it has a very good rigidity but still maintains very good slicing ability due to its flat ground bevel design. There is even an ample sharpening choil present so you can easily maintain the blade sharpness, should you want to. That said, D2 should maintain a nice useable sharp edge for the life of the knife if using it for everyday standard activities. The black blade is DLC coated which is a super hard, scratch resistant coating found on high end military tactical equipment. The Lyra also features a completely protected blade design when closed, so your keys wont be able to hit the blade edge ensuring your knife will remain sharp even when carrying it everyday in a busy pocket. It does this with a specifically machined ""U"" channel that keeps the blade edge out of harms way. Utility The Lyra is such a usable little knife given its ergonomic handle and utility blade, it really is meant to be a useful every day carry knife that can do more than just the basic stuff if you need it too. By the way.. the bottle opener was a happy accident.. we didn't intend this to have a built in bottle opener but it ended up being the perfect shape. Design Specs We first set out to make something completely different from our first knife, the Eclipse, but we kept coming back to the four-bar style design, feeling we still had some interesting areas to explore with this type of mechanism. Sure enough, as we started brainstorming some of these cool ideas, an interesting design started to take form and it practically designed itself. The concept was based around a familiar ""coin"" knife design, like our first knife, but we wanted to get the maximum extension from the linkages to give a much more grippy, usable handle. We wanted to give the knife a more symmetric design from front to back so we made the blade a full flat grind and added a second set of linkages to the backside of the knife to give a total of 4 links. This greatly improves the rigidity of the open knife to give the best control and strength for more demanding cutting tasks. The Lyra is a statement of CNC machining, featuring contoured titanium handles and linkages with subtle chamfers and smooth media blasted surface finishes. The blade has a matching blasted surface on the steel which give a nice diffuse shine that looks almost ethereal in bright light. Don't let its small stature deceive you, this knife is still as intricate as even the best knives having 29 individual parts not counting the two dowel pins and ceramic detent balls. Specs: Blade Length: 1.2 inches Blade Material: Hardened D2 Steel (61 HRC) Blade Stock: 0.120 inches (3 mm) Handle Material: Titanium, 6AL-4V, Grade 5 Linkage Material: Titanium, 6AL-4V, Grade 5 Closed Diameter: 2.0 inches Open Length: 4.7 inches Knife Thickness: 0.4 inches (10 mm) Weight: 1.5 oz Lock Mechanism: Detent only, non-locking, 304 SST with 1.5 mm ceramic detent balls Manufacturing Lyra ismanufactured entirely by milling, turning, heat treating, plating and laser ablating raw metal materials. There are no corners cut to make this knife by all traditional machining methods to give the most industrial look and quality possible. The knives will be fully assembled in the California under our careful watch. We have a new contract manufacturer locally who will be doing the assembly work for us. As mentioned in our Improvement Goals section below, we had a lot of difficulty hand assembling units on the last project and it took time away from other quality checks we had intended to focus on more. With Lyra, we will be free to do all of the important quality checks and will personally tune each knife to consistent working order before shipping. Color Options We are initially offering the Lyra in 2 color options: Silver: Naturally finished titanium handle + links and D2 steel blade Black: Black DLC (Diamond like coating) titanium handle + links and Black DLC coated D2 steel blade (NEW) Carbon Fiber: Carbon fiber handle, titanium black DLC links, and D2 steel blade Other color/material options can be unlocked as funding Stretch Goals. See Stretch Goals section below. Unlock carbon fiber handle material option at the $50k stretch goal. Stretch Goals As part of the fun of campaigning on Kickstarter, we want to offer some additional cool Stretch Goals which will include new color/material options, or free additions, that are available once we reach the mentioned funding goal. This list may continue to expand too: Rewards Below is a table showing our reward pricing. As usual, the early birds and super early birds get an extra discount, though all reward tiers offer a discount over the $109 retail price. The double, triple, and retail packs offer further bulk discounts to the overall price. If you want to add an additional unit to your order, please just add +$89 (normal Kickstarter price) to your pledge over the initial amount for each additional unit you would like to purchase. Timeline Here is a timeline of events from now until shipment completes. This timeline represents quoted times by our manufacturers and assembler as well as some more realistic schedule tasks we learned about during our first project, like shipping time for example. We will, of course, plan to get things done as quickly as possible and push our manufacturers to expedite if possible so we can get you your knives quickly. USA Designed and Assembled Designed and assembled in the SF bay area just a few miles from Apple and Google headquarters. Improvement Goals Our first project, the Eclipse, had more backers than we ever expected it would. This put a huge challenge on us to mass manufacture and assemble the knives ourselves, a challenge which we tackled bit by bit. Despite this challenge we were able to deliver the Eclipse to more than 3200 backers and managed to provide customer support for those that had issues with their units for the several months following the shipping. We want to take what we learned from doing the Eclipse and move forward with new goals. Goals: Tolerancing - On our last project we had some issues maintaining part tolerances due to all of the different materials and coatings. Our vendor was using the same setup for all materials which created some variance in part dimensions (on the micron scale) based on ease/difficulty of machining each specific material. This was obviously an oversight but something we will be looking out for on this next run. We have also slightly adjusted our tolerances to account for worst case scenarios so assembly will go much smoother this time. Improved material finishes - The main issue with fit and finish was in our mishandling of materials during assembly causing undue scratches on some of the components. Our new contract manufacturer should be assembling these units to perfection while also avoiding mishandling units, they are much better equipped for this. Additionally we will have better DLC coatings on the black units with better matching to the blade DLC. Assembly - One of our main issues with our first knife project was that we hand assembled every unit ourselves. This was a nightmare given the number of steps involved and the number of units we sold and it extended our ship schedule as well as caused us to avoid doing all of the other crucial checks on quality and shipping addresses that we should have been prioritizing. We are happy to announce that this will not be an issue moving forward as we have a new contract manufacturer who will be doing all of the assembly work for us in their state of the art facility, locally here in the USA! We can now expect to spend more time ensuring the units are assembled to perfection! Schedule - As mentioned, we overshot our ship date by about 3 months on the last project. Part of this was due to some manufacturing delays and part was due to our inexperience assembling so many units and underestimating the time it would take to do so. Now that we have a professional contract manufacturer doing the assembly work, we have our vendors covering all of the production process for us with our tasks being much easier to estimate. This means, the timeline listed on this campaign is much more realistic! Shipping - There was a learning curve to climb for shipping units. We used an automated shipping software to help us and some mistakes were made (mainly, we did not ship a number of units to the UK, a mistake we had to fix later). We will have much more time to prepare for and focus on the shipping requirements before products finish, now that we have a manufacturer doing our assembly work for us, so fewer mistakes should happen. New lock design - Some of our backers had issues with their lock mechanism on the last knife malfunctioning. This was mainly due to assembly errors, but some of it was due to the fact that the lock took some practice to open correctly and if pressed too hard could bend in a permanent unlocked state requiring some creative steps to fix. The Lyra has a new mechanism design that does not lock but rather just holds the knife open or closed using a detent. This lock can also not be bent too far as it has a physical hard stop limiting how far it can deflect. This greatly simplifies the user experience as no practice is required to open and close the knife and the knife should be more legal worldwide not having a locking feature (this is maybe considered a slip lock now)."

Since releasing our debut album, Dark City, in 2017, we�ve been honing new songs through live performances, playing underground art party venues like Rubulad, immersive experiences like the McKittrick Hotel, cultural institutions like the New York Botanical Garden, and rock clubs like the Mercury Lounge. Now we�re working on an ambitious project that includes recording four new songs for a four track digital EP, a two track limited edition color 7� vinyl single, and a cycle of music videos, each utilizing different analog technologies. We�re calling it Bones and Burning, and we�re asking your help us make it happen. BONES AND BURNING Bones and Burning will include four original songs to be released on multiple platforms as an digital EP. Two of these songs, ""Terminus"" and ""Uncanny Carnival,"" will also be released as a limited edition color 7"" vinyl single, as a nod to our future lack of digital technology. Artwork by Heather Vaughan We�re also planning to create music videos for three of the songs, working with some incredible filmmakers in different mediums and styles. True to form, each video will be created using a different analog technique. The mad geniuses at WLND Brooklyn Public Access Internet will give our real estate nightmare tune ""Open House Fire"" their VHS/green-screen treatment.

Stretch Goal #1: $8,000 We have an opportunity to do something really spectacular with the music video for ""Terminus,"" our epic tale of hope lost and found again: a fully fledged short film, produced with a team of professionals. We've already started preliminary work with our creative team for the video, and we�ve come up with some truly ambitious ideas. We've written a multiple-page narrative script full of dramatic moments, special effects, and deep cinematic references. We've cast every band member we can in the video in distinct roles. We want to use multiple locations-- from the eerie abandoned WWII-era Fort Tilden ruins in the Rockaways, to the ghostly train tracks swallowed by nature in Forest Park, Queens, to the chaotic art-scape that is our beloved Rubulad in Bushwick. We want to hire professional cinematographers, a production designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, and a makeup artist. This is not to mention the cost of film stock, processing, editing, venue rental fees, and the expense of transporting and feeding a cast and crew of nearly 20 people over the course of three days. If we reach our $8,000 stretch goal, we can truly take this element of the project over the top and do it the way we dream of it without cutting corners. Are you with us? If we reach our stretch goal, we'll also record a special backers-only video rendition of our love letter to the party at the end of the world, ""Have You Heard,"" live at an upcoming practice, and share it exclusively with our backers.

We definitely didn't want to be on some high horse to ""save the planet�. Being a superhero sounds exhausting, so we save that for Halloween. For the past 18 months, we scoured the world for the best plant-based materials and created a shoe from scratch. A shoe that looks good, feels good, and does good for the environment. Let us tell you about the shoes, the innovative materials we used, and how they're made. Introducing our product, the PA1 (Pine-apple 1). We've spent the past 18 months crafting the perfect shoe that is comfortable, versatile, and environmentally impactful. Our shoes will keep you comfy from your morning commute to happy hour drinks, look as good with your date-night outfit as they do with your comfy sweats, and will last longer than Nicolas Cage's acting career.

Cork is a key ingredient in our shoe and over 45% of the world's cork is grown in Southern Portugal. The best know-how on working with cork is also there. There is a long heritage of making high-quality footwear in and around Porto, where there are over 300 shoe factories. We can be certain that everyone who works on a pair of Scoots is treated fairly and is paid a living wage. Dave spent a whole month in our factories to make sure. Portugal is strategically located right on the water, which allows us to easily ship our shoes to just about anywhere in the world. We also wouldn't mind some beach vacations. It's important to us to leave as small of an environmental footprint as possible. We accomplish this not only by responsibly sourcing our materials, but also by properly disposing of our shoes once you are done wearing them. We believe that we need to both minimize our negative effects and maximize our positive contributions to the environment. So in addition to our shoe disposal program, we also plant a tree for every email sign-up on our website and for every pair of Scoots purchased. With your help, we can make a difference: our goal is to plant 20,000 trees. Thanks to our email subscribers, we are more than half way there. Your support for Scoots can take us over the finish line! We partnered with Forest Nation to make this program possible and they have chosen Tanzania as a place where these trees can have the greatest impact. Check out one of their past projects, the transformation of the Kwembago Forest, below. We will collect your size information via a survey after the Kickstarter campaign concludes. Our sizing is very similar to a VANS slip on. Here'e exactly how to place your order! Questions? Give us a call at +1-872-588-0008 You'll be receiving your Scoots in early October. Here's what will happen from now to then: Our team is a diverse crew that brings a wealth of experience from a variety of industries to bring this company to life. These are just a few of the places where we have worked, and we are all incredibly proud to be part of the Scoots team now."

There�s 15 amazing artists telling just as many fantastic stories that will take you to everywhere from the dreams of a professional wrestler, to the wild west to the nonsensical post-apocalyptic future. The Paper Cuts Anthology is a labor of love designed to give you wonderful stories with the best production value we can. At the standard American graphic novel size of 6.625� x 10.25� it fits snugly with your other comics in your library. While this project was sprouted from a few college friends at the Memphis College of Art it�s grown to include many talented individuals from across the United States. Comics from creators both established in the industry and up-and-coming names ready to explode off the page.

We let the artists go unchained to deliver the stories they've wanted to tell and it�s paid off with a veritable mix tape of comics compiled to win your heart. We also worked to make some great rewards that will be exclusive to this campaign. We�ll have: Custom pins and shirts! A behind-the-scenes sketchbook showing concepts and early drafts from everyone in the project. Here�s the overview of all the reward tiers: **Not including travel expenses to Memphis, TN if needed! Ever since reading Flight, the anthology created by Kazu Kibuishi and his friends early in their careers, we�ve wanted to do the same thing with our college friends we grew to know and love. This idea has persisted with us because we believe we have stories to tell and one�s that are worth reading. Creator-owned comics are the lifeblood of the comics industry allowing for riskier and more exciting stories that forge into the unknown of storytelling. In a way your contribution here is in support of that idea that writers and artists, without limitations, are able to expand the boundaries of storytelling. That we can continue exploring the unending possibilities of the craft of comics. How will the money be spent? The bulk of the money will go towards production of the anthology itself with the next significant portion going to the creation and shipment of all rewards along with fees from Kickstarter. We've intentionally kept the campaign simple to keep costs down because our main goal is to put this book in your hands. This first volume has been a labor of love from us and because of that no contributing artist is receiving payment for their stories as part of the Kickstarter funds only with the exception of our one stretch goal which is artist bonuses to reward our crew of amazing artists for their time and contribution. Thank you all for your support! We�ve done so much work to get it to now but there�s no way we can succeed in this endeavor except with your help! So, please share this campaign on Facebook, slide it into your buddies DMs on Twitter, somehow give it a dog filter on Snapchat and get the word out about us!"

In 2017 while on a walk in the woods of Humboldt, Bigfoot ran into three humans on the trail... Lisa, Bigfoot, Ray and Neil at the Groundbreaking Ceremony Welcome! We�re Ray Noggle, Lisa Jennings and Neil Cheatum, three beer-loving friends living in McKinleyville who wanted to create a space for friends to gather. What began as an idea over a couple of beers - as all great ideas do - has grown into The Bigfoot Taproom, a tasting room with 32 taps and a 4,000+ square foot dog-friendly beer garden serving a selection of fine local and regional beers, wines and ciders and providing an exceptional location in which to drink them. Why McKinleyville? Aside from liking it enough to put down roots and call it home, McKinleyville is one of Humboldt County's prime locations of growth. However, it has few places to enjoy a cold IPA, pilsner, stout, cider or red wine - you get the picture. We imagined having a spot in our neighborhood with a diverse selection of beer, wine and cider. A place where we could enjoy the glorious sunny days with a great beverage in a great outdoor setting. We knew we�d frequent such a place, and we didn�t think we were alone. Our first step was looking for a location. Turns out available commercial spaces in McKinleyville are a rare commodity and none could accommodate the kind of outdoor space we wanted to create for the community to enjoy. Then we began looking for real estate and that's when a lovely little half-acre came on the market. It was centrally located in McKinleyville and big enough for our needs. We knew if we didn�t act fast it would be gone, so we made the jump and put in an offer. We secured financing, began designing the building and creating the design for what we�re calling Bigfoot's ""Playground"" - the outdoor beer garden. Simplicity being a key component, we chose an industrial metal building that could be erected quickly and would last a lifetime. Once the permits went in the building was ordered and now has arrived to be assembled. That brings us to the present: We have a location, we have a building, we even have plants ready and growing to adorn our beer garden. And yes, we have a lot of debt... Bigfoot looks over the plans Here�s where you come in: In order to make it the kind of kick-ass space that you�ll actually want to hang out in, it�s going to take a bit more money for Bigfoot to get his �creature comforts�: cozy chairs, custom tables and TVs. Plus, we could use more plants and trees fit for Bigfoot to make our beer garden an actual garden... just in time to enjoy the actual Humboldt summer. This Kickstarter was launched in the hopes that you'll want to help be a part of building The Bigfoot Taproom from the literal and figurative ground up - to have some ownership and pride in creating this neighborhood establishment. This is your chance to be an Original Member of our Mug Club or get a sweet special edition T shirt or hoodie. We�re so committed to making this YOUR neighborhood bar, we�re even giving you the opportunity to own your own barstool! The funds raised will - first and foremost - be allocated to fulfilling the rewards. After that, we will purchase additional chairs, tables and TVs with the remaining amount left to further landscape �Bigfoot�s Playground.� More about The Bigfoot Taproom With 32 taps, we�ll have ample room to highlight our fine local breweries and bring in some new and interesting regional offerings. The focus will be on local beer, cider, and wine made in the heart of Bigfoot country. Supporting our local community is of utmost importance to us and we look forward to partnering with other businesses and organizations. We want to become the gathering spot for socializing with friends, enjoying music, creating memories and admiring the beauty of Humboldt County. We hope you are as excited about The Bigfoot as we are! This Kickstarter campaign is dedicated to creating an inviting space with the comforts of home and an unparalleled beer garden. Please join us in building it! Follow our progress on Facebook More about The Rewards: T Shirt Designs Hooded Sweatshirt Designs A little more about us: Neil Cheatum Aside from a brief stint in another part of Bigfoot Country, Neil is a lifelong resident of Northern California. Raised in the backwoods of Redding, Neil moved to Humboldt in 1997 to drink beer (and attend HSU). He graduated in 2002 with a love for beer and cats - and also a degree in Computer Information Systems. After graduation, Neil stayed in Humboldt to work for a small local software company. In 2010, Neil took a position with Green Diamond where he still works today. In between haircuts and beard trims he has been mistaken for a woodland ape. He shares a home in McKinleyville with his longtime partner, Gini, and very many cats. Did we mention Neil has five cats? An avid music lover, Neil has been known to travel far and wide to see some of his favorite bands. In his spare time (which he will have very little of soon) he enjoys taking his motorcycle out for long rides to take in Humboldt County�s majestic views. Also, you know, cats... Lisa Jennings Lisa was born and raised in Northern California, Redding to be exact. She later moved to Humboldt in 2001 to attend and graduate from Humboldt State University with several degrees� and of course to be closer to the ever eluding Bigfoot. Over the years, Lisa has worked at many local spots serving many beers, to many hairy men, but has yet to serve Bigfoot. Determined to find this mysterious creature and see the wonders of the world, Lisa has traveled to over a dozen countries. Since her far reaching search for Bigfoot was without luck, she decided to make her own ""Bigfoot."" Lisa has been an instructor at HSU�s Kinesiology and Recreation Administration Department for the last 13 years. She owns a home in McKinleyville which she shares with her three dogs Tinky Winky, Badger Bear and Chance, aka The Nugs. In her spare time she... wait... she doesn�t have any... but back when she did have spare time she enjoyed painting, photography, and generally creating artwork to beautify homes of friends and family. Her artistic vision has a new home at The Bigfoot where she�s painted custom tabletops that will be used throughout the taproom and beer garden. Ray Noggle Although he wasn't born here, it seems like Ray has been a part of Humboldt County his entire life. A resident since age 4, Ray lived in Manila, McKinleyville, Arcata and Eureka before landing back in McKinleyville for good. He has held quite a few high profile jobs over the years where you've probably seen him: as a mechanic for Opie's Fine Cars, a product developer for Yakima and a firefighter and eventual Engineer with Arcata Fire District. Most recently he worked as a bartender and sales rep with Mad River Brewing Company, sharing his love of beer with folks all over the state. That's not to say Ray has a lot of free time, however. Ray has always been active in his community, be it performing improv in community theater in the past, volunteering for projects with local fire departments or most recently serving as the President of Arcata Sunrise Rotary Club. Dogs are one of Ray's major weaknesses (hence the dog-friendly patio). Big and fluffy, small and scrawny, Ray loves them all. He lives with seven of them at home, which he shares with his patient wife Holly and their gaggle of chickens at 'MacNoggle Ranch.' Beyond their partnership, Neil, Lisa and Ray travel, take care of each other's pets (so many pets) and homes, work on weekend projects and are always hanging out together. All three have a great love for Humboldt County, our local community, a love of craft beer and wine, and they share a desire to work for themselves."

A horizontal scrolling action platformer that will take you through six different levels each with it's own monsters and bosses, with tons of items to collect and powerful abilities to acquire. The lord of the underworld has decided to cast a curse on the town of Illmoore Bay to start bringing his infernal army to rule over the world of the living. But... Why??? Of course, all magic, even magic from the darkest pits of hell comes with a price... Cole and Scarlett, the protectors of Illmoore Bay welcome each visitor as they enter town. As the curse reigns down, the mysterious statues come to life to hunt down the source of evil, solve a mystery and and save the town. Our heroes are way more brave and powerful than they look... The Curse of Illmoore Bay is an action platformer that takes influences from games like Ducktales (NES) and the Megaman series among other retro games. Just press START and select any of the powerful powers and abilities... You need to collect them all first though and it won't be that easy... We really wanted to give the player a lot of variety with the graphics and sprites so we made a ton of art for the game. You, the player can choose one of our two heroes and make your way through a monster infested town visiting different places and buildings and defeating bosses in order to solve the mystery of why is all of this happening and saving the town. Take a look at the complete map with all the stages that you can visit and play and then come back and replay for more points or items. Each level has it's own final boss fight on a special Boss stage area. Creepy isn't it? We don't want to spoil too much but along the way you'll be able to collect powerful abilities that will make the game more fun and challenging with lots of cartoony sounds and animations. Is there a demo version? Of course! You can download a ROM file below and play a whole stage in any SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive emulator or on any real console using a flashcart... Let us know what you think. Download the demo here. Thanks for playing! The game is being made using SecondBASIC so it can be played on any original or compatible SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis consoles using a standard 3 button joysticks or arcade sticks. So far we have most of the graphic workload done, all the assets for the characters, stages enemies and bosses have been completed, most of the engine is finished too, and so are the rocking music pieces for the different levels and screens. The Curse of Illmoore Bay could technically be finished with the assets already created, but we want to give this game the best possible look and feel possible, that's why we need more time and your help to push the development process a little bit further and make something truly amazing. Each character has more than 50 hand made animation frames plus several effects and projectiles. We have plenty of tilesets that allow us to make a great variation when it comes to design stages and challenges for the player.

Artist Turner Mark-Jacobs hard at work on one of the characters, Ben, Rita's father. The Curse of El Cucuy The Curse of El Cucuy is a young adult/horror graphic novel based loosely on the myth (or is it?) of El Cucuy�the cross cultural Latinx �Boogeyman�--set in modern times, and was adapted from an award-winning spec screenplay. Created by screenwriter Craig Phillips and graphic artist Turner Mark-Jacobs, the intent of the series is to elevate and center Latino voices and storytelling and create cross-cultural understanding in these dark times in our country. THE NARRATIVE: After the untimely death of her mother, anxious but whipsmart teen Rita Flores moves with her father to her mother's hometown in the Arizona desert, to live with an eccentric elderly aunt. There Rita discovers a dark family secret. EL CUCUY, the Latinx Boogeyman, isn't a fairy tale�he�s real and tormenting this bordertown until he gets what he wants. Is Rita the only one who stands in his way? Along the way her life is changed by a cast of characters that include her eccentric great aunt Lupe, her new friend and neighbor Candace--a semi-goth artist who believes in both the supernatural and the eyerolling stupidity of the human race, a priest who knows more than he leads on, a wayward boy named Javier who develops a crush on Rita, and her father Ben, struggling with the death of his wife while he tries to rebuild a new life with his daughter. All in the very strange little town of Las Malezas, which is full of secrets and history. This project is to help fund volume 1 of the graphic novel, which will lead to distribution and funding for the rest of the series. Our aim is to tell a gripping story thatv uses Latin American folklore as a way to bridge communities in the United States. Versions of the Cucuy story have been told from generation to generation, with variations on the narrative depending on the region and nation. This story has modern resonance. Alongside a coming of age story, it is a tale of mourning and renewal that everyone can relate to, it includes gripping twists and turns a-plenty, along with a coming of age story--and it will be fun, too. Francisco de Goya: depiction of Cucuy (Coco) In addition to working with a talented graphic artist in creating volume 1, we're excited to bring aboard storyteller/mystery writer/folklore consultant Patricia Santos Marcantonio to help guide shape the story and serve as our Latinx cultural expert. One of the things that I know as a white man in our culture is that I frankly occupy a place of privilege. Part of this privilege is being able to generate funds for a project like this and tell stories for a living. One of my biggest goals with this project is to elevate Latino voices and to be able to pay Latino artists and collaborators to work on future volumes in the series. The $10,000 goal was set to be able to publish the first volume, in order to fundraise for the rest.--Craig Please watch the video here for more about this project. ___________________________________________ TEAM For Curse of El Cucuy, vol. 1, the creators and consultant are: The Writer/Producer Originally from Southern California, Craig Phillips is a Bay Area writer, screenwriter, editor and cartoonist who has an MFA in creative writing from California College of the Arts (CCA) and BA in film from SFSU.

In Fling to the Finish, teams of two players race through colorful, chaotic obstacle courses while tethered by a stretchy elastic rope. When you and your friends first pick up the game your rope will get tangled in practically everything you pass. But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. Experienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer! Teams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players! Fling to the Finish is being developed for Windows, MAC, and Nintendo Switch, and will release in early 2020! Because you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. This control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game. While you push and pull each other in game, try not to do the same in real life! We've built Fling to the Finish to accommodate all kinds of play styles. Players looking for a chaotic, couch co-op party experience love sharing a controller with their partner and racing other friends. For a more competitive atmosphere, you can hop online for matchmaking. If you're a fan of single player platformers, you'll find a unique challenge in controlling a pair of characters and navigating dastardly obstacles in our solo campaign. Local Multiplayer (1-4 players) Locally, two teams can race against each other on any track. Online Multiplayer (1-16 players) Local players can invite online friends to compete in private races with up to 4 teams. A single player, local team, or online team can play online against up to 7 other teams in random public multiplayer races. Local/ Online Co-Op Campaign (1-2 players) Two players can play by themselves through our challenging campaign mode. Players connecting over the internet can also play through this mode with an online friend. Single Player Campaign (1 player) If you're a fan of challenging platforming games, this mode has you covered. Single players can experience our challenging solo campaign, along with other challenge modes that modify the rope and make getting through levels more difficult. Every course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. Opponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another. With a roster of over a dozen unique characters, you're bound to find a pair that matches your vibe. Personally we're a fan of the very autumnal Acorn/Apple combo. Which pair is your favorite? Make sure to be unreasonably attached to it. This is a new reward! All backers above $90 will also receive these rewards! Our small team of five has been working on Fling to the Finish for almost two years. Now, in the final few months of development, we need your help to get the game out the door. The bulk of the funds we receive will go directly into the game's development, which will help us stay in our home here in Philadelphia and work full time on finishing the game. (From Left to Right) Matt Quaschnick Matt does a ton of the coding work, and is probably the biggest reason the game can be played online. He loves online competitive games, and has recently gotten into Old School Runescape. Ryan McMahon Ryan is the production manager on the project, and also an astute level designer. His favorite game is Star Wars Republic Commando, and his second favorite is Minecraft. Andre Edgarian Andre is the lead level designer, and also does a bunch of the production work. He is a big fan of old school arcade games and challenging 3D platformers. Utkarsh Dwivedi Utkarsh is the steadfast programming lead on the team. There isn't a problem he can't endlessly hammer away at while losing his sanity. He loves to play Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six Siege. Ben Spurr Ben is the Art lead on the team, and is damn good at his job. He nerds out over any games that have nice physics."

Mystical Companions and Wildstars now joins the fray! THANK YOU ALL! This has been an amazing campaign, unearthing a mountain of game! See you at the table! Want to Know More? Here's a link to an episode of the Crusader Podcast that Jason did, discussing the development of the game and what sets it apart! Here is a Q&A that Steve and Jason Did with the Hardboiled GMShoe, Dan Davenport himself, in his Random Worlds chat! Welcome to Amazing Adventures 5E The Fifth Edition of the world�s most famous fantasy role playing game has taken the world by storm, firmly establishing those rules as the kings of fantasy once more. Ever since it came out, people have wondered how these rules would work for a modern fantasy game. Many publishers thus far have attempted to apply it to very specific settings, but no major publisher has yet done a broad, overarching game covering any modern genre of fantasy you would like. That�s where Troll Lord Games comes in. We�re thrilled to announce Amazing Adventures: Multi-Genre Role Playing with the Fifth Edition Rules set. At last! With these rules, you can run anything from 1930's pulp adventure to modern urban fantasy, to cyberpunk corporate raiding, to explosive, high-action space opera and beyond. Whatever your favorite genre is, Amazing Adventures can handle it, and it�s completely compatible with your existing 5e fantasy rules! Curious for a preview? Here is is: Amazing Adventures 5E RPG HERE WHERE ARE WE WITH PLEDGES? Recap at the $99.00 level then all of that is included in your pledge already.

Amazing Adventures first debuted in 2010, and at the time was marketed as a role playing game for the pulp era, using the celebrated SIEGE Engine rules that power Troll Lord Games� Castles & Crusades RPG. Within the pages of Amazing Adventures were a complete modern rules system that was 100% compatible with C&C, not tweaking or changing the system, but expanding it to add such things as psionics as well as over a dozen new classes. It was followed up by the Amazing Adventures Companion, which expanded the system to exploit its true multi-genre roots, and by the Manual of Monsters. A number of adventure modules followed, and then, the Book of Powers presented a full supers system, taking the game to the next level once again. Now, we�re thrilled to bring Amazing Adventures, in all its true multi-genre glory, to the Fifth Edition Fantasy rules system. Within its pages you�ll find: Brand new character classes, and classic classes tweaked to work with a modern rules engine, including: the spell-slinging Arcanist; the Gadgeteer or Powered (super-science or mutation-based powers); the super-sleuth Gumshoe; the divinely-blessed Hallowed; the rough-and-tumble, stealthy Hooligan; the psionic Mentalist; the dark Occultist; the down-and-dirty Pugilist; the adventuring treasure-hunter Raider; and the Socialite, who always has the perfect resources for the situation at hand Complete vehicle combat rules, plus statistics for a range of vehicles from standard passenger cars to modern jet fighters and even sci-fi starfighters Two sets of firearms rules, designed for whatever level of variety and complexity you like in your game A complete Fifth Edition psionics system, thoroughly tested for compatibility with the existing rules An included bestiary and rogues' gallery featuring foes and creatures alien, mundane, and supernatural to challenge your heroes New Feats, New Backgrounds, new character archetypes Modern tool kits and adventuring packs Science fiction weapons Cinematic unarmed combat that (at last!) allows you to slug it out and knock out opponents, without the onerous back-and-forth of dealing 1 point of damage every round. Inspiration points which allow you to accomplish great feats of heroics, and use your inspiration for a lot more than just gaining advantage on a roll! Complete rules for play and a GM�s section with guidelines for running a variety of different campaigns A complete game in one book�nothing else required! Amazing Adventures 5e offers the most complete modern take on gaming of any effort so far. You�ll never need another game to run any kind of campaign you want, from four-color supers to gritty action-adventure. It�s all right here in one big tome. Why Kickstarter? Kickstarter has been very good to Troll Lord Games. It�s allowed us to bring a number of really incredible supplements and sourcebooks to market which we may never have taken the chance on otherwise. We�re hoping that people will respond to the idea of a massive multi-genre RPG for the Fifth Edition Rules, and we�re excited to bring Amazing Adventures, already a hit for the Castles & Crusades game line, to this new realm of adventure. We�re not just looking to print this and release it. We�d love to do it in a full-color, dynamic and deluxe hardcover edition to match the high quality that Fifth Edition fans are used to seeing. For that, we need your help. What are the Specs on the Amazing Adventures 5E Book? Once we fund, we'll print a full color, hardcover book that comes in at 288 (estimated) pages. This book will retail for $49.99. Who is that on the Cover? Yes. That is Satine Phoenix, founder of Gilding Light (check them out) and follow her on twitter and facebook. She was very gracious enough to give us permission to use her likeness on the cover of Amazing Adventures 5E. Do I Need the Fifth Edition Fantasy Books to Use This Product? No! Amazing Adventures is a completely self-contained role playing game, presented in a single massive tome! How Is AC Handled? AC is imperative to combat in the 5e rules, and it is still in place. Since modern characters don�t generally wear armor, classes will have a class-based AC bonus that increases as they go up in level. In addition, different classes will add different ability score bonuses to AC as opposed to everyone adding Dexterity. Finally, there is an optional system that allows the GM to award an AC bonus based on how suave, sleek, or otherwise cool your character looks in whatever they happen to be wearing at the time. Modern standard armor equivalents such as bullet proof vests, riot armor, and military combat gear are also provided, and the systems are built to mix and match as you need. Some of This Looks Familiar�. The cinematic unarmed combat, inspiration points, psionics system, and a few other rules developed for Amazing Adventures were previewed in our Fifth Edition Player�s Guide to Aihrde, for the Fifth Edition Fantasy rules. What�s the Catch? No catch! This book is designed to give you a toolkit to build just about any style of play you like. Playtest scenarios included 1930s pulp noir, proto-cyberpunk tech-noir, Buck Rogers-style space opera, modern urban fantasy, and more! If there is a catch it�s that, as with any toolkit game, presenting authoritative, focused rules for everything isn�t possible, and you�ll have to be creative and think a little outside the box to build your genre of games around the rules presented. All the rules and framework you need, however, is right here. Below are expansions to the Amazing Adventures 5E game we'd love to see come to your table. With your help, we can make them happen!

Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS) is a medical condition that alters the speech patterns of the patient so that they are perceived to speak in a foreign accent typically after a head injury. There have only been 60 reported cases of this disorder since its discovery in 1907, and in 60 days you will have forgotten that statistic, which is almost as quickly as how you've forgotten if you've locked the front door on your way out this morning. What you won't forget however, is supporting an indie comedy on its way to the festival circuit because you're in for a ride. Our film has something for everyone. Are you an under-represented by relatable characters in the big screen? So is our lead actress! Have you ever been laughed at and ridiculed for something you can't control like that weird extra toe? Ashley Jones can relate! Ever wondered what it's like to take a bite of a poisonous meatball? Well, this film doesn't want to explore that either. Every donation will help with every aspect of production of this wild adventure, so we sincerely thank you for your continued support and assistance to making this project the best it can be, mystical five hundred thousand year old beings and all.

The gentle weight increases serotonin and melatonin while decreasing cortisol. Helping babies feel calm, fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Clinically proven to significantly increase calm feelings and improve sleep patterns in a study that investigated newborns and weighted blankets. Nearly half of all new parents get just 1 - 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night. Dreamland Baby can help change that... A well rested baby is a happy baby.... Dreamland Baby's wearable weighted blankets are designed in partnership with pediatricians, NICU nurses and certified sleep consults. Dreamland Baby is Safety Certified, has exceeded all United States Consumer Product Safety Commission standards, and is recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as a hip-healthy product. A parent�s hug is scientifically proven to soothe. Dreamland Baby's gentle weight mimics this touch leading to improved mood, relaxation and ultimately sleep. Many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) use weighted components to calm babies and promote deep, restful sleep. The gentle weight provides near-instant comfort and relief. Weighted blankets have been used for adults and children for many years. Infants now have the opportunity to safely get the same incredible sleep and relaxation through Dreamland Baby's wearable weighted blankets. At almost six months old, our son Luke was still waking up every hour and a half. Like so many other new parents we were desperate for sleep. One night we placed him under a heavy throw blanket while sitting on our couch. I noticed a calm immediately came over his face. A lightbulb went off in my head: he needs a weighted blanket! I called my mother-in-law to sew my idea; a lightly weighted sleep sack. The first night wearing our prototype Luke slept 12 hours! We couldn�t believe how immediately his sleep was improved. Word quickly spread and I was flooded with requests from family and friends. The idea to bring Dreamland Baby to families everywhere was born.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We set out to create a swaddle that keeps baby�s arms secure and is convenient for parents. The ingenious removable wing allows baby to stay snug while you wash the wing or completely remove it if baby rolls over before six months. Our products are expertly crafted for the highest quality, made of 100% soft, natural cotton. From beautiful, instagram-worthy design to thoughtful materials sourcing, we set out to design a product that looks and feels as great as it performs. At just 10% or less of your baby's body weight, Dreamland Baby's gentle weight helps calm your baby by simulating the feeling of being held and hugged. The even distribution of weight, covering your baby's entire body, sets us apart from anything else on the market. Dreamland Baby is the world's FIRST wearable weighted blanket! There is another company that makes a sleep product with a weighted component on the chest, only. We ordered this product and for us, it did not work. My son likes to be hugged and feel a gentle pressure on his entire body. He wanted a wearable weighted blanket. Dreamland's weighted filling is a High Density Plastic Poly Pellet (think Beanie Babies�). The material is odorless, non-toxic, and food grade, completely safe! The rounded beads are evenly distributed in hand-sewn 1'' boxes to provide a gentle weight and comfortable texture. There are two YKK zippers. One at the top and one at the bottom for those middle of the night diaper changes. Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love! August 2018: Idea conceived - Luke sleeps 12 hours!

Read the first few chapters FREE on Tapas! https://tapas.io/series/Legend-Of-The-Erased This series deals with a lot of Mature/Adult themes and mental illness, so this isn't intended for audiences who are easily disturbed or are under the age of 15. As for the other characters, well, you have to meet them when you read it! The book will be a 200 page paperback with a matte cover! What will the Kickstarter Fund? The Kickstarter funds will firstly go into PRINTING. I will be printing with https://mixam.com/ which is a company I really like and trust. Those who were here for Book 1 know that there was an issue with printing, but I assure you that Will Not happen with Mixam. I trust them completely. To get 100 books printed, it costs $570. That includes shipping. That plus the estimated backer shipping costs is gonna be $650. Getting the book printed is my main concern. I have a lot of merch left from Book 1s kickstarter, so if we don't reach any stretch goals that mostly will be the merch I use. MERCH Who is Coffee Hyrokoyo? Hi there! I'm Coffee Hyrokoyo. I was born and raised in a small town in Mississippi, USA. I grew up homeschooled and as an outcast, I had NO friends. My siblings all had their own friends, their own lives, whatever. Me though? All I had was my dreams and my thoughts. Haunted by night terrors, I wanted to get these monsters out of my head, so I picked up the pen... and I made my own friends. Writing became my addiction. My escape. My everything... Nothing has changed, I live to create. Daz me I had always been exposed to anime as a kid, but it wasn't until I came across Bleach that I knew what I wanted for my life... I wanted to be a mangaka! It wasn't easy. Everyone wanted to stop me, and if they weren't trying to crush me, they pretended I didn't even exist. I was the 'demon possessed freak child'. But here I am now, I never gave up. My life is dedicated to creating, and I have a story that I desperately want to tell... But I need YOUR help!So please, Help Legend Of The Erased Book 2 become a reality! Is the Book done? The book will be at your door by the end of August at the absolute latest. The Book will be finished in July. Why do the Kickstarter before its finished? Crazy, I know. But hear me out... A few of the rewards allows backers to insert themselves into the book. That would be hard to do if the book was already printed and ready to go! All backers also get a special thanks, so that's more page editing needed. I want to honor my readers, fans, and supporters. What better way to do that than to actually put them in the book?! The book isn't far behind, and even if I get it finished before the Kickstarter is done, the crowd scenes or the scenes that I want to insert EXTRA's in will be left untouched for those who want to be put in the book. Why should I back this? You will be helping a 100% solo author/artist in this harsh comic climate. In a world where hope is scarce, one person standing up to live their dream is a special thing. Support indie creators, not just me. Lets change media, forever. Power to the Creator! You also get a really cool book, a REALLY comfy t-shirt (I wont sell ANYTHING that I wouldn't want myself. So I make sure the Tshirts are comfy and the mugs are usable before I buy bulk orders) All Fan Art I receive goes into the EXTRA's section! Fan Art by Trevis Martinez Fan Art by Sos De Mere Fan Art by Taylor Hagar Mug Reviews For the series So Far Goodreads "" I love the artwork and it is very refreshing to see something different from all the typical manga that I normally see and hope more people will do this style. :) "" Kickstarter Backer for Book 1 Beta Reader Camille ""His tongue is black? Must see this....wow if you look close in the previous chapters you can tell. When other characters mouths are wide open it's white but his is black....cool...fangs too....oh no! I might be a vampire kink thing too-ooo!"" Kickstarter Backer for Book 1 ""I finally got a chance to read Legend of the Erased, and I am a big fan of how it turned out."" Kickstarter Backer for Book 1 ""I just want to say that your manga left me with full of surprises after reading it, including the art. That's how much I find it enjoyable and wanting the next volume to come out so I can start reading."" Reader from River Region Con River Region Con ""Just recieved Coffee Hyrokoyo's new comic book, Legend of the Erased vol. 1! I also recieved several different kinds of merch with the care package she sent me! After following this project since the kickstarter, im so excited to finally own a copy for myself. Ive already slept in the beautiful shirt with the main characters on it too, lol. The book itself is a really good weight and thickness. Its a size between a manga and an american comic book, and it feels really good to hold. The colors on the front look way better then they do digitally. It has a lot of ink and contrast in the pages which makes it fun to read, aside from the characters and story itself. Theres also a nice quantity to it so the money feels super worth it. Even bonus material in the back of the book!""- Beta Reader and Editor Taylor Fan Art by T H Seki ""I only JUST finished Coffee's the 200-page first volume of manga-style epic, THE LEGEND OF ERASED, and want to share my thoughts in a brief review. I'm approaching the project from a similar perspective to Benito in his previous review: wary that my criticism of Erased could very well be a criticism of contemporary manga as a whole, as I'm not really familiar with the style, nor am I the target audience. I love the art style's liberal use of screentones and minimalist environmental storytelling, which I assume come with the territory, as does the bizarre (to me) design decision for an English-language story to read from right-to-left, Japanese style. Though Coffee begins the book with several trigger warnings suggesting the story is suited for mature readers, I feel like younger teenagers would find its themes more relatable, and more importantly, be greater affected by its underlying message - that depression, fear and anxiety can be used positively when channeled into creativity. The story follows depressed teen protagonist Serrain, a girl-next-door type drifting through life after a mysterious traumatic event has left her plagued with night terrors only processable through self-harm. Serrain's life has become a hazy, Perfect Blue-esque dreamscape, indiscernible from her recurring nightmares, and is interrupted when she comes in contact with a dark, brooding protector named Abadon. Whilst protecting Serrain from a leering, goateed suburban fuckboy, Abadon pulls her into a fantasy world that she recognises from her own indie comics - an entire, visitable reality that she created by accident. It soon becomes clear that this world is a representation of her desire for escapism, and Abadon, exiled and abhorred by its optimistic townsfolk, is a manifestation of Serrain's inner demons. Serrain's fantasy stories were drafted with a mystical fountain pen, from which she is inseparable - even during fits of rage, which result in the pen being used to slash at her wrists - and this opening volume implies that the fate of the villagers lie in the balance of Serrain's mental health. This is a huge concept, and leaves plenty of room for future stories, considering Serrain's new love interest - whose black tongue and sharp teeth she finds particularly sexy - is a personification of her own insecurities and shortcomings, and I am not sure if he can be trusted. Is Abadon - who is treated like an unspeakable terror by the optimistic townsfolk - merely telling Serrain what she wants to hear, so her magic fountain pen can be used to create more darkness? How is Serrain going to handle the new responsibility of caring for an entire dreamworld, when she can't even handle a coffee date with a stranger? I look forward to seeing how the idea of creating a healthy relationship with one's darkness can be explored through Twilight-esque romantic adventure. I want there to be a love triangle, where Abadon's foil is a golden retriever transformed into a hunk who fights for Serrain to see the good in people. On the subject of canines, I also have an odd suspicion that Abadon might be a representation of Serrain's dog Abe? Who may be dead? I look forward to seeing how that pans out. The Legend of Erased is great for young fans of dreams, horror, and teenage fantasy - in print soon. Cheers, Coffee Hyrokoyo!"" - Ben Mitchell, Indie Comic Conspiracy - Secret Santa Reviews"

The whole team appreciates it so very much. We hope you love the books! The Icarus and Jellinek graphic novels are about two unlikely heroes: a winged young man who falls into a dormant volcano with no memory of anything but his name, and a flamepetal prospector down on his luck (and everything else), with his two-tailed, four-legged, lava resistant companion, Rig. Together, they must discover the secret of Icarus' identity if they are to save their worlds from those who want his powers for themselves. We are proud to present this story of wonder, of friendship, and of a battle to overcome tyranny, with creatures who discover that what unites them at the core is more important than what divides them on the surface.

To date, Sam and Adam have 6 issues of their debut series �Among the Willows� in print, and are now expanding their work with two new titles - �Warden� (Romesburg/Meadors) and �Children of the Grave� (Romesburg/Roberts). This campaign aims to launch these new titles as effectively as possible, with the budget raised being used to print, deliver and continue these stories by funding page rates for upcoming issues. WARDEN logo - Jeff Baker WARDEN follows the journey of an Arizona federal penitentiary warden after a mass break out of his 5 most dangerous inmates. Set in early 60�s, the Warden is a hardened World War II vet who's experiences on the front lines make him the only man capable of blazing the warpath to bring his prisoners back in, dead or alive. Warden is heavily artistically and stylistically influenced by gritty 1990�s Vertigo books such as Preacher and 100 Bullets, as well as steeped in the harshness and violence of Garth Ennis� Punisher Max. Warden #1 Cover - Bruno Chiroleu In this 15 issue series, a power-hungry mob boss, excommunicated priest, ruthless serial murderer, bloodthirsty war criminal, and a German SS Officer in hiding head the list of the malicious men the Warden seeks to bring back to justice. However, through his travels, the Warden finds himself confronted with not only the estranged criminals, but by countless social situations that bled through the 1960s and beyond, such as Klan rallies, Black Panther meetings, the influx of psychedelic drug use, free love, and war protest. Just another day in the penitentiary. Warden Splash - Bruno Chiroleu and Nick Wentland Warden flashback - Bruno Chiroleu and Nick Wentland WARDEN leads our readers through a blood-soaked journey of defining justice, pushing social boundaries, and exploring the darkest corners of the most turbulent decade in American history through unforgiving, gritty and harsh storytelling. Children of the Grave logo - Jake Beaver 30 Years into the future, earth as we know it has been reset. The new age of humanity is about to enter its third decade. These new humans lead blissful lives, unaffected and unaware of the issues that plagued the world before them. Inhabiting the land known only as �Terra� all of their needs are provided for by forces they do not know or understand. Bountiful crops seemingly grow themselves while electricity and running water systems remain miraculously intact and maintained without any human contact. Children of the Grave splash - Gioele Filippo and Marco Lasko All of this is credited to what the new humans have coined as �The Providers� - a divine and watchful entity, and the source from which all humans are created. Humans arrive on Terra as infants with no memory or sense of blood-bound family. On Terra, the humans are all children of the providers, and they live their lives accordingly. There is no hardship, no pain or suffering, and above all else - a mutual understanding that there is no questioning of any of it. All of Terra�s children abide by this code - except for one. Children of the Grave splash - Gioele Filippo and Marco Lesko Daniel is the exception to the new world. Driven by angst and starved for answers, Daniel has spent his life on Terra challenging the status quo and demanding more than what he has been shown. His days are spent searching for remnants of the old world, constantly piecing together a puzzle no one else cares exists. His search constantly leads him outside of the walls of Terra, and into the over-seeing eye of Elder Brother Cruise - the eldest of Terra�s children. As the peacekeeper and self-appointed leader of this new world, Brother Cruise sees Daniel�s quest for answers as a threat to the hierarchy he has established and works against him in attempts to keep him in line. Children of the Grave page - Gioele Filippo and Marco Lesko Vowing solitude or death over the life he currently leads, Daniel vows to permanently leave the community of Terra completely by secretly slipping away during an enormous celebration for Elder Cruise�s 30th birthday. During the celebration, just as he makes his escape, Daniel notices a figure lurking in the shadows of the community. A woman, around the age of 50. The oldest thing Daniel has ever seen. Completely overtaken with burning curiosity, Daniel pursues her and is given the first concrete piece to the mystery he always knew was there. Children of the Grave Splash - Gioele Filippo and Marco Lesko Children of the Grave takes a hard science fiction approach comparable to that of John Carpenter�s The Thing, Speilberg�s War of The Worlds and the stillness and dismay of post-apocalyptic tales like McCarthy�s The Road and Tarkovsky�s Stalker and mixes it with the vastness, doom, and power of the riffs of its musical namesake.

Our writer Chris Hepler and his world-class team of artists need your help to get this gorgeously-drawn 6-issue urban fantasy epic off the ground. Chris is a writer of the Mass Effect series, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and the Shadowrun RPG. He's joined by Vicente Cifuentes (Superman, Batman) and Mateo Guerrero (Gloria Victis, Jakob Kayne). In our story, an over-educated demigoddess must save the soul of her adopted mother when someone sabotages the afterlife. We invite you to go on her adventure with us! The over-achieving teenager Amanda Polias expected her adopted mother to die� but not twice, and not right in front of her eyes. Amanda concocts a crazy scheme to temporarily stop her own heart and provoke a near-death experience. Her spirit journeys to the afterlife long enough to see a terrifying vortex engulfing the souls of the dead. Hunted by demons and shades, Amanda and her loyal clay golem join forces with an immortal Greek warrior and a Zulu fairy in the hopes of making things right. Her journey to discover the culprit will take her through the Egyptian underworld, into the North Sea, and to the Grand Shrine of Japan, all to answer a single question� who would dare disrupt death itself? You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The Mythkillers � Because striving against Fate and the gods isn't just for professionals! Amanda Polias, The Precocious Investigator with a Secret Like most teenagers, Amanda feels that she can�t relate to anyone. Living alone in a secret high-tech bunker underneath where the U.S. government prints money � the Bureau of Engraving and Printing � tends to do that. She also harbors a secret. Amanda is a product of genetic engineering by her biological mother, the goddess Athena. After her birth, the goddess entrusted Amanda�s upbringing to the Lichtman family. Amanda suspects that her manipulative, perfectionist mother created her for a more practical purpose other than filial fulfillment. Unfortunately for her, she�s probably correct. Dee Tyson, The Long-Suffering Veteran of the Trojan War Originally known as Diomedes Tydides in the ancient world, Dee survives through modern times because Athena granted him immortality long ago. The only mortal besides Hercules to have wounded two Olympian gods -- Aphrodite and Ares -- Dee now pays a heavy price for being a champion of his goddess. Century after century, he has suffered under a curse by both the Goddess of Love and God of War to live without love, honor, or glory until the end of time. Sipho, Terror of the Zulu� and Lover of Whiskey and Chocolates Sipho hails from the Abatwa people, a type of South African fairy from Zulu mythology. As a non-mortal, he is one of the few creatures capable of befriending Dee through the warrior�s divine curses. Together, he and Dee run an eBay business and live in a rundown apartment in Washington, D.C.. Thanks to internet anonymity, the six-inch-tall Sipho has become a prominent blogger and podcaster on the dark web, where he discusses cryptid creatures (skinwalkers, Bigfoot, Mothman, ghosts, etc.) and ""mythological conspiracy theories."" Whenever Sipho isn�t slaying larger opponents � who often badly underestimate him � with poison arrows, he can be found thoroughly enjoying the pleasures and conveniences of modern life. Mac, The Devoted Golem of Clay Maccabee Zeira was cut from the clay during World War 2 by a rabbi of the Lichtman clan (Amanda�s adopted family) to help Jewish refugees and other persecuted groups flee out of Nazi Germany. He has served the Lichtmans ever since up until the death of Amanda�s adopted mother. Responsibility for Mac then passed on to Amanda because golems that exist without a purpose eventually fall into psychosis. Over six-foot-five and strong enough to tip over military vehicles, Mac now serves as Amanda�s loyal bodyguard. His quiet presence often cowers her opponents before the situation comes to blows. His silence also happens to reveal his greatest weakness. He must always carry a shem in his mouth, a piece of paper with the Hebrew name of God written on it. It's the animating object that grants him life. Without his shem, Mac melts into a lifeless pile of clay. Kyros, The God Who Would be Supreme No one seems to know anything about this new, strange, dark god. His schemes and machinations are only revealed after his theft of several powerful divine artifacts� Thor�s iron gloves, the helm of Hades, and the golden thread of Fate itself. What does he intend to do with these relics and others? And how did he create the bloody vortex in the afterlife? What does he intend to do with all the souls trapped therein?

International Supporters should consider the Athenian packages since they contain digital rewards with no shipping charges. Stretch Goals! We�re so happy to be able to offer our stretch goals because we get to start loading everyone up with more cool stuff. Our stretch goal tiers are as follows: $7,000 - ALL backers will receive a black-and-white, digital version PDF of Mythkillers, Issue 1. If any backers have also pledged to receive Issues 2 to 6, they�ll ALSO receive the black-and-white, digital PDFs of those issues, as well. We�re offering this reward as a study so that comic fans can see the transition in the art work between inks to colors. $8,000 - All backers $10 and up shall receive a folding poster version of the Prestige Cover Art for Issue 3 (see updates for a preliminary image). Explorer and Spartan packages shall receive a physical and digital version of the poster. Athenian packages shall receive the digital version. $10,000 - All backers shall receive a 5-page preview of Mythkillers, Volume 2 as a digital PDF! $12,000 - ??? $14,000 - ??? $17,000 - ??? $20,000 - We create a high-quality video of the Mythkillers writer Chris Hepler reading the names of the Mythkillers Army, as his two young children try to shoot apples off his head with toy bows and arrows. And they�re not very good shots, so there will be a lot of entries that sound like �Number 57, Jennifer Hsu of Mountain View, Calif--OW DANGIT!� Yes, we�re only revealing our first and last stretch goal right now. The idea of the last one amuses us. It�s aspirational. But if we reach it, don�t worry, the toy bows and arrows are ridiculous. They�ll bop Chris in the head at worst. (Unless we put cake frosting on them, too.) Note: Divine Creator packages assume that you, the backer, want all the rewards from the Explorer packages in addition to the Divine Creator perks. Divine Creator packages include the highest tier of the Explorer packages as part of their cost. Create Your Perfect Mythkillers Rewards Package on Kickstarter! Due to requests by our Kickstarter backers, we're happy to announce that backers can now pick and choose the rewards they wish to receive. We can only offer these add-ons to U.S. and Canadian backers though. Shipping overseas highly complicates this process. Here�s how to receive reward add-ons: Just add the amount for each reward you want to your TOTAL PLEDGE. MESSAGE us via the Kickstarter system and list the items you�re adding. We�ll confirm these items with you when the campaign ends via survey or direct message. Canadian backers should add $5 shipping if they Add-On small items (T-shirt or lower), up to three items. They should add $10 shipping to Add-On a book, up to two books. Adding more than two books or a combination of small items and books requires $15 shipping from Canadian backers. Let's address the elephant in the room. If we're a big gaming company, why are we doing a Kickstarter to finance an indie urban fantasy comic? To be clear, Seasun Comics doesn't need donations to produce the entire Mythkillers comic series. We will do it. Kickstarters are about more than just money. We need Kickstarter because we're a small team and we don�t have a distribution network here like the established companies do. We're competing against 80+ years of legacy. In other words, we can't easily get Mythkillers into your local comics store. With Kickstarter, we can send the comics directly to you through digital download or direct shipping. Plus, we can't buy the most crucial thing for any new comics: fans. Kickstarter gives us an amazing opportunity to invite fans to go on this journey with us. Comics creators can only build fan communities up out of blood, sweat, and convention appearances until they have followers, mailing lists and Facebook groups. We want to find people who like the same kind of stories we like. We want to let them know we exist. Kickstarter is the best way to make a splash. Lastly, Seasun is measuring the success of its new comic projects to see which of them seems viable enough to turn into a video game or movie. So by supporting Mythkillers, not only will you enjoy a great story and some cool swag, in the long run you�re helping its chances of becoming something you can play or watch. We wish to meet the world, and we want the world to meet us. Our gamers � and now our readers! � hail from many different places around the globe, but we all share a love for great stories and great characters. We hope to help bridge the gap between East and West. Seasun Comics is our way to honor the tradition of our founders as well as break new ground. Vicente Cifuentes: Illustrator & Inker Born in the small, beautiful Spanish city of Albacete, Vicente Cifuentes works as a gifted 20-year veteran of the comics industry. He has devoted his considerable penciling and inking skills to some of the largest publishers around the world, including Marvel, DC Comics, Dynamite Entertainment, Gl�nat, and Soleil, among many, many others. Some of the most notable titles under his belt include Aquaman, Batgirl, Xena: Warrior Princess, and a comic book adaptation of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. Mateo Guerrero Cruz: Illustrator Born in Cadiz, Spain in 1976, Mateo Guerrero boasts an illustrious career among some of the most prominent publications in Europe. His first published work was Cr�nicas de Mesene in 1998. Then, he created Cazadores en la Red, a comic strip published by Idibus, a supplement for the newspaper El Pa�s, the most widely read online newspaper in Spain. In 2001, Mateo broke through into the English language market, drawing Warlands: Age of Ice, for the studio DreamWave. Then, Guerrero conquered the Franco-Belgian market, producing DragonSeed in 2006 for the publisher Humano�des Associ�s. He enjoys a long-running collaboration with publisher Le Lombard that began in 2008 that saw the release of the post-apocalyptic adventure story Beast, the fantasy series Turo in 2011, the grand Roman Empire epic Gloria Victis, and the recent dark historical thriller Jakob Kayne. Juancho V�lez: Colorist Juancho is a passionate, ambitious comic book colorist and illustrator who graduated from the Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art located in Dover, New Jersey. Ever since 2012, Juancho has studied color and its nuances as a means to enhance storytelling. He has dedicated his vivid hues to prominent publishers, such as IDW, Aspen Comics, Madefire, Chapter House, Darby Pop, Devil�s Due, Markosia, Zenescope, and even one small gig for DC Comics (which he hopes will blossom into something much bigger in the future!). Born and raised in Bogota, Colombia, he has ventured across the globe in pursuit of his dreams. He�s lived on and explored both the east and west coasts of the USA. Then, after learning his craft, Juancho forged new friendships and professional contacts in the comic book industry. They enabled him to relocate to Barcelona, Spain where he has plied his artistic craft ever since. As a heavyweight in the world of American and European comics, Spain provided a wonderful creative environment that encouraged Juancho to grow immensely as an artist. Finally, we almost forgot to mention that Juancho is currently on a worldwide search for the best cheeseburger in existence. Got any leads? Bill Tortolini: Letterer Born and raised in the shadow of Boston, Bill Tortolini graduated from Salem State University. He has held the position of creative director for over two decades. In addition to working on large brands and advertisements for Fortune 500 companies, Bill also became deeply involved in the comics industry starting in 1996. Over the course of his vibrant career, he has lettered comics for some of the most prominent publishers in the world, including Marvel, Dynamite Entertainment, Random House, Disney, and Image Comics, among many others. Notable works include Marvel�s Anita Blake comics, the various adaptations of Robert Jordan�s bestselling Wheel of Time series, Stephen King�s The Talisman, Jim Butcher�s The Dresden Files, and George R. R. Martin�s The Hedge Knight and The Mystery Knight. Bill is an avid Boston sports fan, skier, golfer, and pop-culture aficionado. He lives in Billerica, Massachusetts, with his lovely wife, Kristen, their three children Abigail, Katherine, and Cameron, and his sometimes-loyal dog, Oliver. Chris Hepler: Writer It is not certain that Chris Hepler had parents � according to the sacred texts of the 1970s, he was given life when Gary Gygax made a papier-mache golem out of discarded pages intended for a roleplaying game. After a short stint at the Johns Hopkins University where Chris was painted to resemble a human, he began working for such titles as Shadowrun, Earthdawn, and Legend of the Five Rings before pursuing screenwriting. In Los Angeles, he worked on a CBS Television drama The Agency and a Top Cow comic called M.I.T.H., but left for Canada, where the developer Bioware soon had him writing for such video games as Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy. There, he cemented his position as �that writer who actually cares about the science,� creating much of Mass Effect�s Codex, Galaxy Map, and Daily News. His launch-day Twitter event for Mass Effect 3, �Emily Wong Reports Live from UCLA,� made #solcomms the top-trending worldwide hashtag of the day, and yes, that means you can blame him for killing off several beloved characters. Today, Chris is working for Seasun Games on a Pirates of the Caribbean video game as well as its its comics arm. He enjoys dragon boating, herpetology, and as many martial arts as he can get his hands on. He lives in California with his wife, Jennifer Brandes Hepler, and their two loud children. Ed Benes: Cover Artist Perhaps best known for his work on Birds of Prey, Justice League of America, and Batgirl for DC Comics, Ed Benes is one of the industry�s hottest talents! Following the successful launch of the first issue of his first creator-owned title Nina and Ariel, Ed is now hard at work on Issue 2, while also training the next generation of comic book artists at the Ed Benes Studio. Rafater (a.k.a. Rafael Teruel): Cover Artist Rafater (whose superhero secret identity is Rafael Teruel) is a Spanish illustrator and masterclass artist. He studied Fine Arts in Barcelona and began his professional career 10 years ago when he discovered the power of digital art. He mainly works as an illustrator and has designed characters for several large companies and game projects, including Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Legend of the Cryptids, Dragoborne, Infinity the game, and HEX TCG among many others. He published several art books with Norma Editorial (Nightmare: Dark Gods), Design Studio Press (The Line Art Challenge), and Ediciones Babylon (EROS: The Sexiest Art of Rafater). He�s also the co-founder of the Creatuanary Challenge along with Dibujante Nocturno and Joshua Cair�s. Together, they successfully executed their first crowdfunding campaign for the first Creatuanary published art book. Rafater is incredibly active on social media, especially on Instagram, where he has garnered almost 170,000 fans over two years. Currently, Rafater teaches part-time at Escola Joso and the Universitat la Salle while also aiding the development of some pretty fresh and amazing art projects that are under NDA (so he can�t talk about them! Don�t ask!) Ediano Silva: Cover Artist Ediano hit the ground running with his professional debut on the incredibly successful relaunch of Grimm Fairy Tales for Zenescope (v2 issues 1-3) and hasn�t let up since! Following his stint on GFT, Ediano illustrated the entire Pathfinder: Runescars series for Dynamite Entertainment, and then moved on to the comic book adaptation of the popular Microsoft video game Killer Instinct, while also adding nearly 20 cover illustrations whenever he had a free moment �and this was all completed in just his first year in the industry! Ediano is a workhorse with a finely detailed style, and the future is bright! Ediano just completed work on Vampirella / Dejah Thoris, and is just starting in on his new project (as yet unannounced). Rich Young: Art Director Rich began his professional career in the U.S. comics industry over 20 years ago at Dark Horse Comics, and most recently finished a 9-year run as Director of Business Development for Dynamite Entertainment. His broad background spans editorial, licensing, marketing, and business development. Some of the graphic novels and art books Rich has edited or project managed include: Brandon Sanderson�s White Sand, Jim Butcher�s Dresden Files, Joe Abercrombie�s The First Law, Robert Jordan�s Wheel of Time, Charlaine Harris� Grave Sight, Patricia Briggs� Mercy Thompson, Paizo�s Pathfinder, Paramount�s The Warriors, Grumpy Cat, The Art of Atari, Undisputed Street Fighter: A 30th Anniversary Retrospective, and The Art of Tekken: A Complete Visual History. A longtime resident of the beautiful Pacific Northwest, Rich lives, works and plays in Portland, Oregon. Rich is also the drummer in the local 5-man band Dear Drummer. The soul/funk/rock group regularly gig around town and have plans to go back into the studio to record their third album later this year. Philip Daay: Managing Editor Phil Daay serves as Lead Writer and Managing Editor for international game company Seasun, Inc. He oversees his company�s narrative efforts to produce their online mobile game Pirates of the Caribbean: Sea of Glory in partnership with Disney. He also supervises all aspects of production at his employer�s latest comic book publishing venture, called Seasun Comics. In the film industry, Phil wrote the feature and short film adaptations of the critically-acclaimed comic series Black Salt. The Black Salt short film recently won 1st Place in the Urban Action Showcase. HBO/Cinemax agreed to broadcast the film and it thereafter gained over 3.3 million viewers on their platform. His upcoming Sci-Fi/Thriller movie Abduct won distribution at the AFM. His Psychological/Thriller Alone has recently completed post-production. He also wrote the Horror movie Left in Darkness for legendary producer Stephen J. Cannell. Phil strives to include three crucial elements in every story. Stories should escalate into an emotional catharsis in the end. They should contain loads of suspense and keep audiences guessing. Most importantly, stories should explore some aspect of what it means to be human, layered deeply into the Hero's tale. He applies this discipline and passion to every story and in every genre. Phil currently lives in California with his wife and a toddler who loves to wander off and explore the wide open world. And the last word... We hope that this page answers all your Mythkillers questions, but just in case it doesn't, you can leave comments on the Kickstarter page or send an email to philip@seasungames.com. We've warned Phil that he might get a mountain of e-mails as soon as the Kickstarter goes live, so he's prepared. Or at least, we thought we warned him. Good luck, Phil! In all seriousness..."

Estimated breakdown of total costs: Stretch goals: $850 total: a section introducing screen reader software, why screen readers are important and issues in designing with screen reader parsing in mind, gets included in the application. $1,000 total: in addition to the screen reader section: this stretch goal enables a section on captions and audio descriptions, who might use these features, and why media accessibility is important as the world goes into the third decade of the 2000s. $1,500 ULTRA MEGA Goal: this would be THE BEST and would mean separating out the code so I could do optimized iOS and Android versions. As in, the iOS version would be written like an app MEANT for iOS. (Think the difference between a game released for a specific console and those ported/cross-platform. Same game, but the ones designed with specific consoles in mind are optimized for that. Similar idea here.) - Initial budget breakdown: $300 business / trade registration, paperwork, etc; $99 developer license (iOS); $200 art budget (icons, logos, used throughout the application, multiple formats of said art, time); At least $150 for 10 testers for first round of testing; any additional monies go towards further testing and refinement, or paying for additional development (programming) assistance. What is this? FoxAccess is a mobile application designed with React Native, and meant to act as an overview and quick reference to digital accessibility. The app will also be designed with accessibility and inclusion in mind and throughout testing. The App: The application is meant to help introduce the What, Why, and How of digital accessibility. It guides the user through an introduction to example needs, and that needs and disabilities are often on a spectrum (The What). There is also an overview of the difficulty that various people face regarding using apps and websites, and oft-stated difficulties in bringing it up/teams remediating (the Why). There will be an option to jump to the resources directly upon opening the app as well, such as linking to WCAG 2.0 web standards, Section 508, and other helpful links (The How). - While companies like Microsoft have been increasing their accessibility commitment so everyone can use their software and games, many developers still view accessibility as ""extra and unnecessary work"", do not realize that disability encompasses many factors and spectrums (is not ""on or off"", like someone is either 20/20 vision or can't see at all) or do not realize that accessibility features can impact more than just a single segment of users. Designing for access and inclusion also helps children, the elderly, people with less visible disabilities, and more. Tech industries already have noted issues with applications reflecting sexist or racist unconscious bias, meaning the bias was built into algorithms or the applications were only tested with an extremely limited user base: and while there are people who do not have computer and internet access at home due to poverty (which intersects with disability as well), approximately 1 out of 5 people in the US identify as having some sort of disability. (CDC infographic on disability) (Census.gov report) Certainly, with the integration of sharing videos, memes, etc on social media, playing games, and emailing, let alone making appointments and banking online in our daily lives, you know someone who has access needs of some kind, who uses a smartphone or computer. In addition, many accessibility resources that are in use are geared towards legal or technical requirements, which can be difficult for users and content creators to grasp. And while there are accessibility consultancies and tools, accessibility is not a matter of ""one and done"" automated tool use, either. While these tools and services are certainly valuable, input from people with varying disabilities is important - not just on a basic principle of user research, but in terms of justice and inclusion as well. Who is this for? Primary audience is users - a person in front of a computer with only general knowledge, not necessarily technical. However, users with needs like captions (whether due to hearing issues or executive functioning issues, or language issues), or find themselves having to advocate for their own needs, may find this application useful for management and developers to be introduced to why accessibility is important, what resources ARE out there for implementation help, and possibilities as to what they can do next to help. Who is making this app? Is the app cross-platform? Sustainable? Only one person is the developer of this app! Which is myself. However, I cannot speak for every disabled person, and so want to include testers of a variety of abilities and disabilities - and because people with disabilities are often among populations with heightened rates of poverty (did you know it is legal to pay someone with disabilities UNDER minimum wage in many states?) I want to ensure payment for ALL testers is at least $15 an hour. As the application is in React Native, it is eventually going to be cross-platform and tests will be both on iOS and Android. Estimated breakdown of costs, again: $300 business / trade registration, paperwork, etc; $99 developer license (iOS); $200 art budget (icons, logos, used throughout the application, multiple formats, time); At least $150 for 10 testers for first round of testing; any additional monies go towards further testing and refinement. Stretch Goals! $850: a section introducing screen reader software, why screen readers are important and issues in designing with screen reader parsing in mind, gets included in the application. $1,000: in addition to the screen reader section: this stretch goal enables a section on captions and audio descriptions, who might use these features, and why media accessibility is important as the world goes into the third decade of the 2000s.

From dicing up dinner to chopping up some snacks, our goal is to add a bit of quality craftsmanship to your kitchen that will last. We have a local lumber supplier that allows us to be very selective in choosing materials. This ensures that only lumber with the best color and the highest grain quality are used in crafting our boards. Supporting our project will allow two disabled veterans to expand their business by acquiring better woodworking tools and to start a website. These two things will allow us to share our love for hardwood crafting with more people, successfully expanding our business, and helping support our family. In addition to tools, the money will pay for the materials needed to create the pledge rewards. Thank you for you support and God Bless! About the Process Each and every item is hand-crafted, one at a time, here in the Heart of Texas. Each item is unique. No two are exactly the same! We hand-select each piece of wood for superior grain placement to make the boards beautiful and durable classic designs. We start with the item you select, with the chosen details customized by you. Below are a few photos showing the detail and process involved in creating the items. Layout of patterns Clamping as glues set and cure. Sanding and routing for desired edge details Each item, whether it be large or small, goes through a rigorous process of carefully selecting the wood, laying out the design of the board, glueomg and clamping process, routing (shaping) the edges, multiple stages of sanding, and finishing the details. Then the finishing coats of a custom food-safe finish are applied. There are more steps than you think involved! As a side note, we do our best to get all of our creations to the exact sizes in the discriptions, but from time to time the dimensions can vary slightly.

I especially love soap bars, shampoo bars, and salt scrubs. Most importantly, I care about these products because purchasing them allows me to reduce waste. While these products are not always as convenient as traditionally packaged materials, I think it makes a difference for our planet and our skin to choose them. Earth has provided us with an overwhelming number of gifts. Why not use them well? I have recently graduated with my Master's in English, and I plan to teach writing courses for the rest of my life. I love teaching, and I love writing. However, especially in this economy, teaching doesn't pay well. I do it because I love it, but a girl's gotta keep a roof over her head. I love making soap, and the joy on someone's face when they take that first deep breath of the scent makes me happy. It feels good to lather yourself in something you truly enjoy. So why not supplement my income by starting a small soap business? Of course, my mutual love for writing and soap-making is not the only thing that connects these two ventures. With each soap bar you purchase, I will include a short quote from various works of literature. My favorite poet is John Milton, and his words and my values have given me the name of this small business: Heaven's Last Gift. Each carefully made product you receive from me is made from the gifts Earth and Heaven have given us. All packaging is 100% recyclable, and I make sure to use environmentally conscious ingredients. Help me spread the joy and love of Heaven's best and last gifts and pledge to my campaign today."

The East Nashville neighborhood seems to provide a constant stream of often bizarre, often perplexing, always entertaining events that we all love to follow. Whether an unopened gallon of milk have been sitting at your front curb for a couple of weeks or you just spotted a grown adult dressed as a chicken (again), you know everyone will want to hear about it, even if they have moved away. As I have joined in as a spectator and reporter of new events, I realized how great it would be to have a single collection of some of the most memorable moments, and thus this coloring book was born. After initially making a list from my own memory, I began talking to friends and neighbors (including our online community page). This helped me fill in the gaps in order to make a solid roster of East Nashville�s �best� moments. I did take some creative licenses. like choosing alternate street perspectives, in order to make well balanced compositions that would also be fun to color in. However, none of the pertinent facts about the incidents have been altered or exaggerated. If you are a long time East Nashville resident, you are likely to quickly recognize all of the locations and events included (you might even have been present at the scene). If you are a newer resident or visitor of the neighborhood, this will be a great way to understand what an awesomely weird place it is. Please support a local project made in East Nashville and completely about East Nashville in all of its strange glory. About the Creator I am a local teacher (and artist on the side), and I have lived in East Nashville since 2013. When my job brought me to Nashville six years ago, I immediately knew East Nashville was the neighborhood I wanted to live in and have been here ever since. While I have mostly been a spectator of our latest neighborhood news, I am responsible for some facebook post such as �Pregnancy test discovered on the side of the road� and �Chair left on lawn for pickup makes a couch friend by next morning�. The Art All of the drawings are original, hand-drawn illustrations of actual events that took place in East Nashville. I started by choosing events, gathering any photos that were posted about it and then taking lots of my own photos of the East Nashville intersections in question in order to choose the best viewpoint. Once I had a general layout in mind, I began making a pencil sketch of the scene. After I adjusted sizes and slightly moved some stop signs that were blocking the view, I began the ink line-drawing process. Then the process of scanning and digital editing begins. As far as the content goes, I chose the ones that caused the most interests, likes, and uproar on Facebook. It has been hard not to laugh out loud while drawing. So many scenes were personally suggested by our residents. Because of all of this, you should be advised that this coloring book may not be suitable for children. Our neighborhood is awesome but it may not always keep things perfectly classy, or PG for that matter. Still, you can expect some hilarious moments that you can color in and keep. Final Product I have been drawing for a few months, but progress has been slower than expected. I have a tiny person to keep alive, on-and-off part time work, and haven't always been able to find free time to sit down and work. Now that I�m near the finish line, I need one last push to get these babies printed which is where your financial help comes in. I am currently working with local print shops and designers to lay out the book. There will be at least 15 original illustrations and they will be printed on thick, high quality paper, with one scene per sheet in case you would like to remove and display them. I will be updating our supporters with exciting details as they are finalized. I can�t wait to put this book into the hands of our community, who I�m sure will enjoy adding their own spin to each page. Ask me more If you have any additional questions like �Will there be brown recluses?� or �Was that fireworks or gunshots?� feel free to ask on here or reach out to me at rosanac@msn.com, message me on Facebook, Twitter @OnlyInEastNash, or Instagram @rosana.portillo.art"

Ca�on de Chelly / Vanishing Race / The Scout - Apache Thank you for checking out our project! The Curtis Legacy Foundation's goal is to print 60 total prints of three famous Edward S. Curtis images�Ca�on de Chelly, Vanishing Race, and The Scout-Apache. These three photographs are being produced from actual Curtis Studio glass plate negatives passed down through the Curtis/Graybill family. ""I am John Graybill, President of the Curtis Legacy Foundation. My two sisters, Ann, Janet and I are the only great-grandchildren of Edward Curtis and have finally made the commitment to continue our ancestor's great dream: to bring the history, knowledge and understanding of the Native American culture to the world. I say finally because while we were growing up there were always Curtis images all over the house�it was no big deal. According to our dad, it was to be kept that way. He despised anyone who made money from Curtis' photographs because like most famous artists, Curtis himself died poor and unrecognized for his work. It has taken until now, for us to realize the importance of Curtis' own descendants sharing our family history; we have documents and treasures that other researchers/historians don't have and we feel the need to share it."" ""Just before our father's passing at the beginning of 2019, my sister's and I presented the idea of carrying on the Curtis legacy through the founding of a non-profit organization in Curtis' honor. Our father, Jim, was one of only two grandchildren of Edward. Our Uncle Ted was killed in WWII before he could marry and have children, thus leaving the responsibility of carrying on the Curtis legacy in the hands of my immediate family. Dad gave a large portion of his Curtis collection to the Smithsonian years ago, but held out a number of glass plates negatives and those serve the basis of this Kickstarter offering. We also asked dad specifically about selling photogravure prints to be made from these negatives. Dad was glad to see our strong interest in carrying the torch and thought these were both great ideas. Somewhat to our surprise, we got his blessing!"" Depending on the image, vintage originals run from $3,000 to $100,000 putting them out of range for many people and leaving them to be displayed only in private collections and museums. The Curtis Legacy Foundation wants to print new photogravures from these negatives, giving you the best reproduction quality available today, at a much more reasonable cost. Yes, there are other reproductions on the market, but most are either a lesser quality printing process or made from copying original prints, thus also reproducing the texture of the paper they were originally printed on as well. Every time you make a copy of a copy, it reduces the quality of the print. A ""Remastered Original"" means that we have digitally cleaned up imperfections on the image and worked the subtleties of the negative to achieve the highest quality and richest reproduction possible, while still maintaining Curtis' original intent. You may be asking ""what is a photogravure?"" Digital (direct to plate) photopolymer gravure printing is done using a photopolymer plate which is printed on directly bypassing the traditional film overlay, resulting in a high quality plate that can reproduce the detailed continuous tones of a photograph. These types of prints are individually printed... one... at... a... time. Roll on ink�wipe to right amount of ink�run through the press�wipe the plate totally clean�start inking all over again. You will like the results! It is very difficult to explain the whole process here, so go here for more information on the photogravure process. ""Remastered Original Photogravure"" is what the foundation is calling these new, digitally cleaned up versions of prints produced using modern photogravure methods. The photogravure process for these prints was chosen because it was one of Edward Curtis' favorites. All of the tissue and fine art paper prints in The North American Indian and portfolios were printed using this method. The archival value of photogravures using proper inks and quality papers is substantially longer than that of silver-gelatin and current photographic processes, thus giving you a print that will stand the test of time, 600 years or more! This makes these prints truly an investment that you will be able to pass down generations. The intent is to give you amazing affordable prints that mirror Curtis' vintage originals but not at vintage prices�we want them in your home, not locked up in a museum. A huge part of the Curtis Legacy Foundation's mission is to tell the stories surrounding the images. The more we know the stories behind the images, the more we like them. Each image you pledge to, you will also receive a story about it. Ca�on de Chelly by Edward Curtis, 1904 Have you ever looked really closely at the image Ca�on de Chelly? There are, what we believe to be, 5-7 spirit orbs in the image. Check out the enlarged image below with some of the orbs circled. We didn't notice them until we were working up the image for printing. We started taking them out digitally, but then realized what they likely were. When we were in Ca�on de Chelly last fall, we asked my Navajo guide about them. He enthusiastically agreed that there are spirit orbs all over the canyon. That was all the affirmation we needed! Can you imagine what those spirit guides are trying to tell us? In a note written by Edward to his son Hal in 1948, he asked if Hal remembered the face in the rock from the family trip to the canyon in 1904. If you look above the left side riders, you'll see the profile in the highlighted rock. Ca�on de Chelly Orbs Vanishing Race - Navaho by Edward Curtis 1904 Vanishing Race is also of the Navajo Nation and likely taken in Ca�on de Chelly or Ca�on del Meurto. This image, according to Edward's son Hal, was taken with new equipment and was severely underexposed. They had to work very hard in the darkroom to result a good image. Regardless of what Curtis' initial intention for the image was when he clicked the shutter, sometimes the mistakes end up telling the story better than you planned. His fear for his Native friends was that their way of life was disappearing due to the white colonization, and he felt this image portrayed that�that they were headed into the dark unknown. Curtis was very saddened by this thought and in his own words to President Teddy Roosevelt wrote, ""You realize too, Mr. President, that the Indians we are looking at in these pictures will no longer be with us 50 years from now. This great race of people in their primitive state will be vanishing from the earth. White man's progress will eliminate their way of life and all they hold scared. In the westward thrust of civilization, there is no place for him unless he sheds his beliefs and assumes our mode of life."" Thank goodness they held tight to their beliefs through this dark time and are now becoming stronger than ever! We want to celebrate this strength and resilience by keeping Curtis' images in the public eye, bringing attention to the resurgence of this amazing culture. The Scout - Apache by Edward Curtis 1906 The Scout - Apache ""To follow them was a fruitless task which often led to the destruction of the pursuers. The primitive Apache was a true nomad, a wandering child of Nature, whose birthright was a craving for the warpath, with courage and endurance probably exceeded by no other people, and with cunning beyond reckoning. Although his character is a strong mixture of courage and ferocity, the Apache is gentle and affectionate toward those of his own flesh and blood, particularly his children. Fear, to him, is unknown. Death he faces with stolid indifference; yet Apache men have been known to grieve so deeply over the loss of a friend as to end their troubles by self-destruction."" Volume 1, page 14, The North American Indian by Edward Curtis As you can tell, all of Curtis' images are not only rich with stories and culture, but are beautiful fine art worthy of hanging in any office or home. How would you feel if anyone of these images, or all three for that matter, we hanging in your home? Just imagine the stories you will be able to tell your friends and family about them, showing your support of not only Curtis' work, but understanding the need for diversity and other cultures to enrich everyone's lives.

Pledge $150 - 8x10 Fine Art Print - Castle of Dreams Did you know that Edward Curtis also photographed fine art nudes in the 1920s while living in Los Angeles? A reliable source has told us that ""Castle of Dreams"" is of model Rose Delgado. When I questioned our source on the spelling of her last name, he answered ""I would bet a stack of comic books on it!"". Ms. Delgado is standing in front of a background painted by Ferdinand Earle, who was the set artist for the Cecile B. DeMille Studio in Hollywood. Edward also worked for the DeMille Studio in the Roaring 20s, photographing movie stills for such productions as The Ten Commandments and Adam's Rib, among others for multiple studios. Curtis produced a set of three fine art nudes, Castle of Dreams, Aphrodite and Sunset Trail. This set, along with other things, proves what an incredible photographic artist he was. These images were all originally printed as a blue toned silver gelatin print and used to help raise funds to continue his ""North American Indian"" project. This image is also printed from an original Curtis Studio negative. This print will be a full bleed (edge to edge printing) 8x10"" on Hahnem�hle Torchon paper, a pure cellulose watercolor paper with a distinct textured surface. It will be mounted on 3mm white styrene to prevent warping. It is also available as an 11x14"" print listed below.

When I questioned our source on the spelling of her last name, he answered ""I would bet a stack of comic books on it!"". Ms. Delgado is standing in front of a background painted by Ferdinand Earle, who was the set artist for the Cecile B. DeMille Studio in Hollywood. Edward also worked for the DeMille Studio in the Roaring 20s, photographing movie stills for such productions as The Ten Commandments and Adam's Rib, among others for multiple studios. This image is also printed from an original Curtis Studio negative. Curtis produced a set of three fine art nudes, Castle of Dreams, Aphrodite and Sunset Trail. This set, along with other things, proves what an incredible photographic artist he was. These images were all originally printed as a blue toned silver gelatin print and used to help raise funds to continue his ""North American Indian"" project. This print will be a full bleed (edge to edge printing) 11x14"" on Hahnem�hle Torchon paper, a pure cellulose watercolor paper with a distinct textured surface. It will be mounted on 3mm white styrene to prevent warping. It is also available as an 8x10"" print listed below. Pledge $250 - 11x14 Fine Art Print - Black Hair We have chosen one of our favorites images, Black Hair, taken by Edward Curtis in 1905 for this pledge level. This image was NOT used in Curtis' 20 volume ""The North American Indian"" nor in the accompanying portfolios. The image itself is approximately an 8x10"" image printed with about a 1-1/2"" white border. It is printed on Hahnem�hle Torchon paper, a pure cellulose watercolor paper with a distinct textured surface. It will be mounted on 3mm white styrene to prevent warping... and will look incredible on your wall! Pledge $500 - Curtis Family Favorites Collection This collection consists of 10 Edward Curtis prints on sturdy triple thick art paper inside a handcrafted image box. Curtis' own descendants have selected their favorite images to add to this collection and have written an explanation as to why it's their personal favorite on the back of each image, along with their name and relationship to Curtis. The cover is a Mocha raw silk fabric with ""Curtis Family Favorites Collection"" embossed on the lower right corner in rose gold. It will be a perfect accent to most any home decor. Each image has a 1"" white border around the image making it suitable for framing or you can trade images in and out of the box and display them individually on an easel. We know you will love this collection! Pledge $750-$1000 - Remastered Original Photogravures Get one OR all three in the Trio Collection! These photogravure prints are made from actual Curtis Studio glass plate negatives, passed down to me, John Graybill, his great-grandson.

I will hand sign the back of each print and they also come with a Certificate of Authenticity and story about the image. These Remastered Original Photogravures will be approximately a 14x17"" image with a 3"" white deckled edge border.

They could talk about the life and history of Edward, or they could break it down into particular topics such as his work with specific tribes, his relationship with Teddy Roosevelt, his camera gear and types of printing or just share his family stories. They have a wide range of knowledge so they could Q & A for hours! John and Coleen are also working on the Descendants Project. John, as the direct descendant of Edward Curtis, is seeking out the descendants of Curtis' images. He and Coleen will be interviewing, photographing (with a similar camera and glass plate negatives to Curtis), and telling the story of being a Native American in the 21st century. This project will culminate with a coffee table book and a traveling exhibition. The stories they are learning from working on this project are also fascinating and could be a short presentation as well. With this level you will also get to choose ONE of the photogravures. Which is your favorite? Pledge $10,000 - Play Hooky with the Graybills When is the last time you played hooky? Take the day off and meet John and Coleen Graybill, great-grandson of Edward Curtis, for a day of exploring a Curtis exhibition, gallery, library, university, museum near you (in the USA only) or just hang out in your living room for the day talking about Curtis! They will share family stories and answer all your Curtis questions! As a thank you for this tremendous support, we are adding ALL of the reward goodies listed above including giving a presentation to a group of your choice! We just ask that they be scheduled on consecutive days."

I am a 2D animation student, a freelance artist and a part time Artist Alley vendor at local comic and anime conventions. I've been creating merchandise for the past 5 years or so for my table, and I've done things like keychains, coin purses, prints, vinyl sticker sheets and more! I've wanted to do enamel pins for a very long time, and I've had so many ideas knocking around in the ol' noggin. So I had to think to myself which one I wanted to tackle first! I decided on a ""Dungeon Master"" pin, inspired off of DND and fantasy tabletop gaming, for all of my fellow nerds out there. I've seen a good amount of folks make d20 designs, or designs based on the classes, but I haven't seen nearly as much love out there for the hard-working DMs! Dungeon Masters work very hard to craft fun stories, engaging battles and thrilling mysteries for their players to solve, and it's time they got the appreciation they deserve in the form of an enamel pin! The Dungeon Master enamel pin is a 1.5 inch hard enamel pin with gold metal. The magical dice floating in the design will have a gold glitter to them too! The goal of $200 will be helping fund the production of these pins with a manufacturer, payment & mold fees, the costs of shipping them to me, and then shipping costs of shipping them out to all you wonderful adventurers! By pledging to this kickstarter, you'll be helping fund these pins and getting one for your very own, while also supporting an artist that is hoping to create many more nerdy pin designs! You can keep this pin for yourself or give it to your favorite Dungeon Master to show them just how much you appreciate all their magical hard work. Thank you very much for reading! STRETCH GOAL -- DELUXE VARIATION! UNLOCKED!!! If this campaign gets to $500, it will unlock the deluxe color variation of this design! It will be done in silver metal, have glow-in-the-dark eyes and dice as well as a dark blue glitter background! This is inspired off of some of the more cosmic art I've seen people do of DMs and really driving home that all-powerful story crafter role."

We are so glad you've made it this far, and we hope you will take a look through our project and choose to support our dream! We are raising money to take care of the last few things needed to get us on the road. From commissary fees, to permits, to all the supplies we will need to serve with, we can't move forward until these things are taken care of! Our waffle truck was inspired by our love for waffles. It began with a simple tradition of eating waffles every Wednesday and has grown into a business where we can share our love for waffles with the community around us. Watch our video above and keep reading below for more information on how you can help us and how this dream developed! OUR STORY Let�s take things back to the beginning where the idea of this waffle truck was inspired. It takes us to a small college town in South Carolina where Aleisha, a young lady who is from northeast Ohio, and Holly, a former Clemson college graduate from New Mexico, met as fellow baristas at a local coffee shop where they bonded over their love for waffles and their dream of owning their own business. Both have a love for people and a desire to cultivate community, so they thought, ""Why not try to combine our love of waffles with our love for people?"" This jumpstarted their journey to begin Waffling! Soon after they started to dream and plan, their friend, Trenton, a young man who moved from Pennsylvania to South Carolina to help start a teen ministry, decided he wanted to jump on board to make this dream happen! Aleisha, Holly, and Trenton They have been working on this project for a few months now, meeting up every week and scheduling taste testing events, photoshoots, and meetings with local business owners to get tips on how to best run Waffling. Our friends have also played big parts in the process to make Waffling successful! MISSION Aleisha, Holly, and Trenton are all on staff at a local ministry in Seneca, SC. This ministry focuses on working with at-risk teens by simply spending time with them through activities to build relationships. Because this teen ministry is something they all love to be a part of and desire to see succeed, Waffling will be giving a percentage of their profit to support the ministry so they can use the money on activities and events with the teens. Our goal is to serve the best waffles in upstate, SC, cultivate an atmosphere of community, and give back to local ministries. WAFFLES Our truck will be designed to provide people with fresh waffles such as our rich, delicious chocolate waffle, our dairy and gluten free waffle, and our golden plain waffle. We will also have a topping bar filled with our wide array of toppings that people can use to create the waffle they want! We will also offer a selection of waffles that we have created with our favorite toppings just for you! Strawberries and cream waffle Maple bacon waffle Chocolate peanut butter waffle REWARDS For those of you wanting to pledge to our Kickstarter, we have some great rewards! From tickets to our grand opening party, t-shirts, a year of free waffles, and pre-paid waffle parties for you and your friends! Keep scrolling down to see some cool merchandise we have made! HOW CAN YOU HELP? GIVE! - The very best thing you can do is give to this Kickstarter campaign to help us cover the cost of things to get us started!

It has been a long time coming and I appreciate your attention~ this project means a lot to me and features two of my favorite things -- teddy bears and magical girls!! I really love plushies and wanted to capture their sweet, fluffy style, I hope that you enjoy it! This is my 3rd project and I'm very excited to get this collection made! Each goal will unlock a dress-up bear and / or companion mascot. Please note that the reward tiers you pay for are for individual pins -- bears and companions are at different price points to purchase due to the size and difference in complexity. This way we can make the kawaii companions more affordable for everyone! The bears start at $9 in the 1 pin tier, and the mascots/companions start at $7 in the 1 pin tier. Below are all of the designs which are now unlocked! Thank you to all of my wonderful backers for helping bring this project to reality. Many of the pins feature details like screenprinting or glitter, and some of them even feature real 3-D crystals! The Bears average at a size of 2"" tall and the companions are small pins averaging around 1"" tall! I have put a lot of effort in to ensure that all of the bears and companions are matching in size and proportion~ I'm super happy to offer some great freebies for all my backers!! Each pin comes with a matching diecut jumbo glossy sticker, these are made at home by yours truly! Anyone who backs at least 5 pins or more will get a special soft enamel ""the bear button"" enamel pin for FREE! This is a cute bear-themed button that I like to imagine Momo-chan uses in her sewing tools. Your pin will be chosen at random from 6 colors. On top of that, you will also receive a special ""Momo's Break Time"" mini print which is currently in the works~! And if you are a REALLY big fan of this project and back 10 pins or more.. you get all of the previously mentioned freebies plus a super super cute small mofumofu paw pin! This is going to be another super cute pin that will be great as a board filler and wearable every day~ you will be sent one color version at random! Both the button pin and paw pin can also be added to pledges for +$5.00 each Q: What is the benefit of pledging on Kickstarter for your project now? A: You help get the pins made, of course! Besides that, you receive freebies, a great discounted price not available anywhere else, and are guaranteed the standard grade of your favorite design(s)! I tend to never get enough standard grades as I'd like for popular designs, so they are often sold out before I even get them in stock. Q: When will I be charged? A: You will only be charged when the Kickstarter ends and if it has successfully raised enough money for our first goal. Q: How do the reward tiers work? I want X pins but there are only tiers for 1, 3, or 5? A: When you pledge, you can actually manually adjust the amount! All you have to do is add the +$ amount that you see listed in the tier for each extra pin. If you are international, just use the standard currency conversion given to you online. All prices in tier descriptions are listed in USD. Please don't be shy to ask me if you need help pledging! Q: What does ""International users add +$7 for full tracking"" mean? A: I am super happy to now offer much cheaper international shipping than before! However this means that if you are outside of the US your pins are shipped a bit differently. Due to the limit on package thickness & bend ability I have to package them differently. Your pins will not receive extra padding inside (I usually wrap all my pins in bubble for extra protection) and stickers/paper will not have any cardboard to protect them. The +$7 is on top of how much you are already paying for shipping. So, if you are paying $9 for shipping, you have to add $7 on top of that. Please note that regardless the international shipping is still first class mail and the tracking is still very limited no matter which option you choose. Once it arrives in your country, it may not track anymore. Again this cost is in USD, please use your standard conversion rate given online! I'm sorry for any confusion by the way it was worded in the reward tier descriptions, unfortunately I lost the ability to edit it ><; Q: Who is this cute bear girl scattered among your Kickstarter? I want to be her friend! A: That is Momo-chan! She is one of my original monster girl characters and the mascot for this Kickstarter. Momo-chan grew up with a love for teddy bears, and runs a small boutique with handmade plushies in her little Yokai Village. I plan to include some freebies of her in the Kickstarter if we can raise enough money The worst part of pin making, I wish I could just *poof* my designs into reality, ha ha ha! We all hate waiting and, while I can't predict delays or issues, I try to minimize them as much as possible and I will communicate them to you all. Our timeline, if everything goes without issue, is as follows: May 24th - June 23rd - Kickstarter runs~ (ganbare!) June 23rd - July 13th - Funds arrive & are transferred to manufacturer July - Pins are made by my manufacturer and shipped to me~ (My cameo the sticker robot works hard at sticker making at this time as well ehe) August - Pins are sorted & checked for quality, rewards are shipped to all backers! Thank you so much for your love and support in my projects! If you can not pledge but enjoy my work, I appreciate your comments and sharing with friends~!

My name is Andrew and I am an independent artist, aspiring e-commerce seller, and creater of Subculture Creature shop on Etsy, a shop geared mostly towards creating horror-inspired enamel pins. Although not typical to the theme I am planning for the shop's future, I thought it would be nice to commemorate one of my favorite shows of all time, Steven Universe. I wanted to stay true to the source material while still throwing my own love of monsters in the mix, thus, Monster Fusions was born! The first pin of this proposed set, and the one who inspired it in the first place is none other than Alexandrite! If she is fully-funded, Alexandrite will be a massive ""2.5 double-pronged soft enamel pin with iridescent rainbow metal (inspired by the real life gemstone) and an epoxy top coat to give in a glossy, hard enamel look. This pin will be a great addition to any Steven Universe fan's collection, or really anyone who appreciates a bad ass giant woman. I am working with a middle-man pin company with whom I've worked with in the past to create my first (and so far, only) pin on my beginning Etsy store (It's been well recieved so far, much to my joy!) Please consider pledging if you are able and wish to participate in helping a budding shop grow, as well as receive a new addition to your pin collection. If you are unable but would like to see the project funded, send the link to a friend and/or fellow Steven Universe lover! the more people who see the project, the more likely it will be successful.

View all sample photos here: http://bit.ly/2R9esG7 So you think you know your lenses? Well then you will know that ultra wide aspherical lenses are industry gold standard. They make a world of difference, with cheaper spherical lenses often the cause of major distortion and aberration. The wider the lens, the more difficult it is to achieve zero distortion. No Distortion vs Distorted Image Why the price difference? It�s all to do with the glass finish based on how the lens is manufactured. Most large-scale manufacturers sand and grind theses spherical lenses in to shape, which can cause minute, but vital imperfections. By melting the glass first, the purity and finish of an aspherical lens can be guaranteed. The Solution: A New Technique for Zero Distortion With a bit of innovative thinking, the ShiftCam team have come up with a new precision technique to produce the smallest ever aspherical lens for your phone. Combining 15 years of optical engineering experience and 9 months of dedicated product development in partnership with industry leading manufacturers from Korea, Japan and China, the Design and Development team has created one-of a-kind tooling capable of sustaining thousands of degrees heat whilst maintaining precision and accuracy. These custom-made discs of glass will enable perfectly concentrated light sources to be piped into your phone, maintaining zero distortion and replicating all that you see with the naked eye. Lens Structure Design Of course the ShiftCam Team never do anything by halves. So to be absolutely sure that chromatic aberration does not occur, we�ve taken things one step further, rearranging our lens structure into a unique 6 Element 4 Group structure. We even created new tooling to make sure the final step of nano-coating covers the entire surface of the aspherical lens for edge-to-edge flare-free clarity. The easy alignment system with a slide and shift channel makes changing lenses so easy you can do it with your eyes closed. Small, swift and secure the multi-locking system ensures reliable attachment of your lens regardless of weight, size and focal length. Customised for different iPhones, the ShiftCam Mounting System is a smart but simple accessory that ensures you are always prepared. Universal mount can be mounted on any smartphones, with added cold shoe mount to mount any tools a phonetographer needs. ShiftCam�s increasingly comprehensive series of interchangeable lenses allows you to choose from an array of lenses and get the best results. Compatible with All Smartphones ShiftCam Cases are compatible with iPhone 7 and above. If you�re not an iPhone user, the Kickstarter Special Edition Universal Mount is compatible with any other smartphone.

After three entirely crowdfunded story albums, the stage is set for our biggest release yet. As we transition into a new phase of the band, we will be adopting a whole new branding as well, and going by the name Coyote Kid as we continue to develop the vision and style we established as Marah in the Mainsail, revitalized and poised to explode onto the world-wide stage. We really believe in this music, and we cannot express how honored we are to serve such a passionate fan base. We cannot do anything without you! Kian Dziak, Austin Wilder, Cassandra Valentine, John Baumgartner, Austin Durry This new story album is titled The Skeleton Man. The sound is large and aggressive, but more stylistically diverse then any of our previous releases. We wanted to take the cinematic sound we established in our previous albums and expand it to encompass more musical influences and a larger emotional range. From dynamic drums, growling bass, and shimmering spaghetti-western guitars, to soaring trumpets and bellowing trombones, the stage is set for this supernatural, post-apocalyptic western. This is, by far, the most dynamic work we have ever compiled. Each record will be pressed on beautiful marble vinyl, and will include the full album story and lyrics, a poster insert, and a pair of red and blue lenses that reveal both sides of The Skeleton Man cover art. The album picks up the ongoing tale of the Marah Anthology. The story of our last album Bone Crown ended in an apocalyptic wildfire that left the world in ashes. This story begins hundreds of years later. The world is wild and untamed, as civilization is slowly rebuilding from the ashes. We follow the story of The Coyote Kid, The Bloodhound, and The Medicine Crow as they traverse this new dark age under the watchful eyes of The Skeleton Man. We have always built our albums around narrative stories, and we want this album to be as immersive as possible. We are excited to share that the full Skeleton Man Bundle includes a set of three metal mini-figures � The Skeleton Man, The Bloodhound, and The Medicine Crow � as well as our complete new merch lineup! The Bloodhound, The Skeleton Man, The Medicine Crow. Get your choice of white or black T-shirts, all double printed on incredibly soft, high quality shirts, or snag one of our new ultra-soft hooded sweatshirts! We are really proud of this new merch line, and we want you to feel proud of the art you have helped create. All merch designs subject to change We want to bring an element of adventure into the real world with this album, so we have gone out and hidden The Golden Skull of the Skeleton Man somewhere within the US (similar to a geocache). The only way to find this beautifully-crafted, resin skull is to discover the passcode hidden somewhere in the album. This code will eventually lead you to the GPS coordinates to find the skull. The first person to find it gets a full merch bundle of all of our releases, as well as free shows for life. As soon as the album drops, the game is on. The Golden Skull of the SKeleton Man. Will you be the first to find it? We are so thankful to all of our amazing supporters. You control the future of the art you believe in, and we are truly honored to have your ear and your support. Our future is in your hands. -Coyote Kid"

Our goal is to get our award-winning, Caribbean-inspired tacos to you faster, more efficiently and in more places. With the food trailer comes the costs of outfitting it with the right equipment, that includes a larger griddle, commercial fridge, steam table, deep fryer, prep station, hand-washing sink, generator and wrapping our 8.5-by-20-foot trailer in bright, bold colors. If you don't know, this equipment costs thousands of dollars, and we are two ambitious 20-somethings trying to make it happen on a budget.

Despite her low standing, she finds herself in a position that can dramatically alter the fate of the company� as well as her own. The Receptionist, proof of concept DIRECTOR�S STATEMENT The Receptionist is inspired by my own experience working at the Weinstein Company during the scandal that became ground zero for the #metoo movement. When the scandal first broke, I was of course appalled by Harvey�s actions and admired the women who bravely exposed him, but to say I was shocked would be a lie. Tales of the casting couch have existed since the dawn of the film industry, and frankly, I was no stranger to the whispers about what Harvey did in hotel rooms� after all, it was the worst kept secret in Hollywood. This made me question my own complicity. Was there something I could have done? Even if I had known, would anyone believe me? And why didn't this reckoning happen sooner? Deep down, didn�t we all know this was going on� not just with Harvey, but everywhere? There is no simple answer to these questions, and I want this film to explore the complexity of this issue. That is why I decided to tell this story from the perspective of the receptionist. I wanted to illustrate how the imbalance of power in a corporate setting makes it difficult for those with little power to come forward or speak up. Oftentimes, those with the least to gain have the most to lose. As a storyteller, I�m drawn to stories about the unseen, internal struggles of everyday women. My NYU thesis film, Teen Daze, was about a young girl exploring her sexual identity. With The Receptionist, I want to tell a story about reclaiming one�s voice. The Receptionist, proof of concept TIMELINE As it�s early in the pre-production process, we are still locking down exact dates and deadlines. Here is our rough timeline: Pre-Production � May / June We are currently in the process of casting and assembling a great crew to help tell this story. Film is a collaborative art and no one job is too small! Production � July We will be shooting for 2-3 days in Manhattan. Post-Production � August / September We already have an incredible post team and plan to jump right in after wrapping. Ideally, we�ll have a completed film by September. Festival Submissions � September onward We plan to submit to top-notch film festivals such as Sundance, SXSW and Tribeca. Premiere � Early 2020 We hope to premiere the film at a film festival before sharing it online. Those who donate $25 or more will have access to a private link the day of the premiere. The Receptionist, proof of concept THE TEAM Brigette Lopez - Writer/Director Brigette Lopez is a third generation Cuban American from Miami who swears cafe con leche runs through her veins.

Under the mentorship of Susan Seidelman (Smithereens, Desperately Seeking Susan), Brigette�s wrote and directed her thesis short film TEEN DAZE which went on to screen at numerous festivals. She currently lives in Brooklyn and spends her free time writing and teaching herself tarot. Stephanie Salgado - Actor/Producer Stephanie Salgado is a Colombian American SAG AFTRA actor and filmmaker! When her parents first came to this country they would sneak her into the movies. As an impressionable five year old she wanted to be a part of making those stories. She went on to get her BFA from NYU Tisch School of the Arts.

SundayMorningView (SMV) is new kind of online magazine for women�SMV inspires women to be natural, sexy, strong and above all: to love themselves. Our goal is that one day women will not feel the need to hide their bodies in shame or feel less than, but rather embrace the desire to love their bodies with confidence. We live in a world where fashion magazines and media constantly feed information to women on how they aren't beautiful enough through fabricated beauty ads, SMV offers women something radically different. Rather than give women an unrealistic representation of beauty, SMV gives women a raw, unadulterated kind of beauty to be inspired by. By replacing the media's fabrication, we are creating a change towards a more natural beauty, a beauty that is ever lasting. SMV is a digital outlet that publishes daily content and features on self-love, body positivity, health, fashion, travel, sex and relationships. Regular articles include: approaches to natural beauty, photographic stories to inspire women, articles on loving your body along with humorous and educational content. Interviews accompanied by beautiful photography with inspiring women we call ""SundayGirls,"" inclusive of athletes to activists changing the world. Since launching SundayMorningView.Com in 2015, we've grown a community reaching over 140,000 on social media with more than 37,000 posts on our personal hashtag #SundayMorningView, with a reach of over 300,000, more importantly we are changing the lives of many women. Everybody's excited about SMV. Click to Watch. SMV is for THE WOMAN who feels she isn't beautiful enough. It�s for the woman who has cellulite, stretch marks, extra weight or doesn't fit into traditional beauty standards. It's for the woman with a Hijab and for the woman sun kissed with all shades of beauty. SMV is for ALL WOMEN. We celebrate the beauty of women daily but Sundays are extra special because we feature one inspiring woman who celebrates her imperfections as the very things that make her perfect, we call her a SundayGirl. We celebrate her with a different kind of photoshoot, it's a bit unorthodox because: We remove the dresses, the heels, the makeup, hair extensions and free women from societal beauty restraints. On Sunday she is just herself, raw, bare and beautiful. All shoots are natural. This means makeup free, re-touching free, and free of digital body manipulation. A SundayGirl encourages realness, by being the example. Here are just a few inspiring SundayGirls we've featured: We live in a world where women don't feel beautiful nor feel like they can ever measure up to society's beauty standards. � Only 4% of women around the world consider themselves beautiful (up from 2% in 2004) � 72% of girls feel tremendous pressure to be beautiful � More than half of women globally (54%) agree that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic Our dream is to help women feel beautiful and our journey has just begun. Join us on this beautiful ride to help women feel beautiful, it's time for the world to see beauty in a new way. With your pledge we can: Fund our office which serves as a hub for our community and is inclusive of content creators, staff writers, a photo studio, and most importantly, the epicenter for all of our inspiring events.

So for our first stretch goal, we are working to collaborate with a talented artist to create a badass poster for this movie. But to get the quality of the poster we want, it will cost a bit. This poster will act as the face of our movie. Also, if you or someone you know is an artist willing to collaborate with us, shoot us an email at blindcop2@gmail.com! BLIND COP 2 is a hyper violent, action revenge feature film that satirizes and pays homage to the action genre, all while thriving off it's own originality. This film was inspired by the absurd staples of action cinema in the 1980�s: protagonists are invincible, countless henchmen are killed with no remorse, and blood...lots of blood. There have been a plethora of over-the-top 80�s revival films recently. However, BLIND COP 2 is different from the rest. It has a crazy premise that takes itself completely serious. We feel the funniest films are the ones that play it straight. Final product Behind the scenes It all started 5 years ago as a fun idea, a goofy little short with a character named, BLIND COP. We never thought this could expand into anything more than just a homemade video to share with friends and family. Fast-forward to 3 years later, at the end of our second year of film school, we found that many of us were growing tired of the countless sequels, reboots, and remakes that have overcrowded the market of today�s cinema. We wanted something different, something we haven't seen before. We came back to the character of BLIND COP and decided to develop a sequel to a movie that was never made. What's more original than that? We created a NEW proof of concept trailer to show you our vision for this film. BLIND COP 2 is a feature film that not only Hollywood can't make, but won't make. Final product Behind the scenes Now after over 2 years of development, we have a completed 90 page feature script that explores action movies in a way we haven't seen before. On top of that, we are big believers in pictures speak louder than words. So instead of just talking about the film we want to make, we thought why not show it. That's why we decided to film a teaser trailer for BLIND COP 2, to show what we can do with just our passion and hard work. Behind the scenes In order to accomplish a film that is true to the spirit of 1980�s action movies, we are going all out with practical effects. That means miniatures, explosions, squibs and lots of fake blood. This helps the actors with their performances and will immerse the audience deeper into the world of this film. Your donations will go towards making this a reality. While we really believe in our technical skills (and hopefully the trailer proves it), we can't make this film on our own. We need your help. Your donations will go towards everything from feeding the cast and crew, to paying for locations and blowing up fake heads. Any amount of support is appreciated!

The U.L.C. range prints easily on FDM or resin machines with minimal supports needed (a few print without support), and are easy to clean thanks to their rounded, fuzzy features. In standard scale (close to 32mm scale, if you want to match them with mainstream ranges like Games Workshop or Reaper) they stand just over 20mm on average (though you can print them in any scale you like). Some core urzans with a people eater (upcoming stretch goal model). Urzans come un-based, but you can base them any way you like. (We're partial to 20mm clear acrylics.) It's even easy to base them before printing with your bases of choice, if that's your jam. With the core rewards, you get the 17 urzan models (shown above). For everyone backing at the $25 level and higher, we'll be unlocking stretch goals as we go: GALLERY A full squad of people eaters (our first stretch goal to be added) along with the variant field commander that comes with the set.

His Holiness Pope Peter II lies on his deathbed. You are among the few Cardinals he trusts to serve as his successor, but you have to earn it by performing good deeds. To complicate things, the other Cardinals won't go down without a fight; they'll do everything they can to sabotage your every move. Pay them back in kind. Pope or Nope is played in quick rounds. Each round, players attempt to perform a good deed. Players then take turns sabotaging each other's deeds, redeeming their own, or using action cards for added strategy. The first player to complete 5 good deeds is the winner and may don the Papal Mitre.* *Included in select tiers Each round, each player is dealt 5 cards. Players are given the opportunity to play a DEED from their hand by placing it face-down in front of them. Once all players have played a DEED (if able), all players flip their cards face-up. Subsequent cards played during the round will be played on top of these initial DEEDS. Players take turns playing one card at a time, starting with the player holding the INITIATIVE TOKEN, and continuing clockwise. A player's turn consists of one of the following: SABOTAGE - play a matching CROSS card on another player's DEED REDEMPTION - play a DEED of the next level on a CROSS card USE OF AN ACTION CARD PASSING - out of necessity, or strategically When all players have passed in succession (or have run out of cards), the round ends. ALL cards from the round are discarded. Any DEED that is not CROSSED at the end of the round is worth 1 point to the player. The first player to earn 5 points wins the game. Pope Peter II may have ideas about who should succeed him, but His Majesty King Carlos II has his own list of papabili. Work collaboratively to defeat the opposition. When playing with an even number of players, Pope or Nope can be played in teams. The first team to earn 7 points is the winner. Watch our 6-minute comprehensive tutorial. Numbered I-IV, these cards represent ""good deeds"" that each cardinal may perform. The higher the level, the greater the deed, and the rarer the card. DEEDS can be played on cards whose level is one less than their own. Numbered I-IV, these cards give each cardinal the ability to sabotage the deeds of another. CROSS cards can only be played on DEED cards of the same level. If a DEED remains CROSSED, it will not be worth a point at the end of the round. This card is used to ""reduce"" the level of any numbered card in play by 1. When REDUCO is played on a Level I DEED, the player is thrust into ""Dante's Infernope"". This DEED is now Level 0 and is not worth a point. This Player has been thrust into the second circle of ""Dante's Infernope"" This card is used to ""cancel"" a card that is already in play. All cards that may be ""cancelled"" feature the CANCELLO STAMP. When placed in front of a player this card offers a new ""opportunity"" for the performance of a good deed, and the chance to earn multiple points in a single round. Discard this card to draw two cards to your hand. The POPE card acts as a ""wild"" DEED. However, it cannot be played to begin a round or to fill an OPPORTUNITAS card, and cannot be reduced. It is still vulnerable to sabotage with the correct CROSS. When the POPE is played on a Level IV card, ""Papal Infallibility"" is invoked. This DEED can now only be sabotaged by a NOPE. When the POPE is played on a DEED below Level I, he lifts the player out of ""Dante's Infernope"" and acts as a Level I DEED. A NOPE card is the ultimate sabotage. NOPE can be played on any card in play and redemption is impossible.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 In 2014, Rather Dashing Games released a new game which became one of its signature titles: DWARVEN MINER. The game featured a two-tiered crafting game where players delve into the depths of ancient mines to acquire materials necessary to forge mighty artifacts for their Dwarven patrons. It remains one of Rather Dashing's fan-favorites to this day. Now, in 2019, Rather Dashing Games is pleased to announce that LARRY ELMORE has signed on to help reforge this game into a new masterpiece! DWARVEN MINER: REFORGED is a game for 1-4 players (currently) and builds on the tried-and-true mechanics of the original while adding new depths of play based on feedback from our dashing fans. Featuring increased player interaction, intuitive strategy, and the approachable game-play Rather Dashing is known for, DWARVEN MINER: REFORGED is a sequel more than a reprint and is an excellent addition to the line. Review of the game by Lynnvander Studios. Larry Elmore has been a cornerstone of the fantasy games industry for nearly 1000 years (give or take). Larry's signature style has become its own fantasy genre and helped put Dungeons & Dragons on the map way back when dragons still roamed the earth! For DWARVEN MINER: REFORGED Larry offered to paint a new cover, new game board, and any other pieces necessary to bring this game to life. Among the stretch goals is a ""Backpack Board"" which would serve as each player's unique resource management playing area. We made it the first available stretch goal because Larry really wants to include a third original oil painting for us in the final game, and around here we does what Larry wants! Larry has also generously allowed us access to his considerable library of beloved legacy artwork to round out the game and make it even more epic and nostalgic. Larry is already hard at work painting up the new cover and game board. Part of the Kickstarter goal is to help cover his expense, but we thought we'd post some work in progress of the board and planning. DWARVEN MINER: REFORGED is ""Art you can play"". From all of us at Rather Dashing, thank you for supporting this unique project. Obviously, the art of Larry Elmore is included at all levels of DWARVEN MINER: REFORGED. New box. New Gameboard. New Cards(?). Also, as a Kickstarter Exclusive, Larry will sign a gameboard plate to be affixed to the Kickstarter editions only! After that, it depends on the general success of the campaign (this is where all of you fine and dashing folks come in). $7,500 : Funded! Thank you! Includes a Kickstarter-exclusive signed ""plate"" you can affix to your game board or box! $10,000 : Backpack Player Boards! All games will now include a player board, one or each player, painted by Larry Elmore! $15,000 : Challenge Coin! For doubling our original funding level, all backers will receive (free) an exclusive Larry Elmore challenge coin. It has Elmore on the front, and our Dwarves on the back! The game rules will quite clearly state that players with a Challenge Coin get first chance to choose their position. Additional challenge coins may be purchased as an add-on. $20,000 : 5 Player expansion! We will develop a 5-Player expansion and include it in all copies of the game. $30,000 : The Tower of Elmore! We will draw upon some of Larry Elmore's amazing art to create a fun, themed dice tower (using punchboard material) to sit alongside your game board. One free copy of The Tower of Elmore will be added to every copy of REFORGED! CHALLENGE COIN : $10 Add a Larry Elmore challenge coin to your pledge level. DWARVEN DICE : $30 Upgrade your dice to some gnarly Dwarven-metal versions, provided by our awesome friends at Norse Foundry! This add-on is a set of 6 high-quality metal dice; a $40 value, offered here at $30. SIGNED PRINT : $40 Larry will mail you a signed print of his REFORGED cover or game board art.

Finally, any retailers can pic up as many copies of the above Rather Dashing Games at 50% MSRP. When deciding who gets to go first (or last, or even third, if your prefer) all players with a Challenge Coin get to game for it. Place your coin beneath the table and then choose a side to be face up when you turn your hand over. Or, leave your hand empty. When everyone is ready, reveal your hand. (do not simply drop the coin. Turn your hand over to show an empty palm or a face-up side of the coin. (Dropping the coin is automatic disqualification. Metal is too precious to discard!) Of course, Nothing beats Larry Elmore! Larry Elmore beats Dwarves (but he's very conflicted about it). Dwarves are better than Nothing!

I'm CR, a freelance illustrator and cat enthusiast. Here's my cat, Jak. A big boy. I adopted Jak twelve years ago, he was part of a litter of stray kittens someone had found on their property, and he's been a spoiled baby ever since. Anyone who's hung out with me has probably been subjected to me excitedly showing off pictures of him. I even made a zine about him (Ask Me About My Cat) that I bring with me to conventions, and it's been fantastic connecting with other cat owners who love to tell me about their own kitties. No matter where I am, what convention I'm at, I've always found other cat enthusiasts who can relate to everything from floofy snuggles to having to deal with yelling for food at 5 am. This shirt is for them. And me, it's also for me (I love my cat, ok). The Tee The tee is a Bella + Canvas Women's Raglan Tee with 100% Airlume combed and ring-spun cotton. Printing will be done here in Austin, Texas by Antic Screenprinting. You can find their sizing specifications here. It features a single pocket-sized graphic on the upper chest area, and a full-sized graphic on the back. Shirts are available in Small to XXL. All supporters who order a shirt will receive a survey at the conclusion of the campaign to specify what size they'd like. Front and Back Front Graphic Back Graphic The Sticker The sticker is a 3"" x 3"" waterproof vinyl sticker, suitable for indoor or outdoor use. Slap it on whatever you want (within reason) and let everyone know how you feel about cats! It's sticky (but like, not in a bad way) The Buttons A set of three 1.25"" buttons featuring some very good boys. Just a bunch of good beans. Cat Commissions I also have a very limited number of commission reward slots! This includes all previous rewards, including the shirt, sticker, and buttons, as well as a commission of your own cat (or maybe a friend's or your mom's or maybe just some cool cat you saw on the street) in this style! A big mood. You'll receive both a digital copy of it as well as a 8.5"" x 11"" print. I'll contact you to make sure to get proper references of your kitty, as well as make sure that their personality gets across in the artwork. Stretch Goals and Supporting Paws Cat Shelter While Jak has a comfy home to call his own, there are still a lot of cats out there still looking for their forever home, and I'd really like to use this shirt to help bring some awareness and support to that. Our current funding goal doesn't leave much room for donations outside of production and shipping of rewards, but once we hit that goal, I plan to donate 10% of each shirt sold to Paws Cat Shelter, a non-profit and no-kill shelter located in Woodstock, CT. While I recently moved to Texas, Paws was my local shelter for years, and as a small town shelter can always use more support. If you don't want to wait for the campaign to end to support them, you can find them here! On top of this, once we've reached the $1600 goal, I'll be adding in a 4.7"" x 1.9"" vinyl sticker to all tiers at no additional cost! The Cost Printing costs for the shirt takes up the bulk of the funding goal at about $1300, since the front and back design require two separate screens, which raises the price a little. Kickstarter and credit processing fees I've estimated to be around $130, and the rest of the money goes towards sticker printing, buttons, shipping supplies, and a little bit extra to cover anything that pops up."

Simply, vinyl toys. You know, the art toys more and more indie artists are tapped to design. If you're not aware, modding those toys has become a popular culture in it of itself, so much so the manufacturers would sell blanks of their forms for hobbyists to mod. And for the LONGEST time I've wanted to mod a toy, but I couldn't for the life of me think of what to do! Then it hit me. I've come to find that a lot of artists in this space have Stormtroopers or skeletons in their personal work. And I thought that would be a fun mash-up. And with that, SKULLTROOPERS were born! After meetings with companies and what not to show the work, variants sprang from the OG Trooper, and next thing I knew I had a whole line. Which brings me to Kickstarter. I would love to give this idea form. And while this sprang from an idea for idea for toys, I would love to see this happen as an enamel pin set. Each pin will measure approx. 2"" high. And you can see the collection below. I hope you dig the idea. And I hope you'll become a Backer. But if anything, thank you for your time. �Ben UPDATE 6/4/19 UPDATE 6/5/19"

Soon after they arrive, however, they discover the adverse effects that �time� has had on the spirits, hindering their memory and clouding their judgments. As tensions rise amidst the uncertain and crumbling power structure within Moonside, the �future� will be dependent not only on the diverse and widely opinionated ghosts, but also on choices the humans will make. �Welcome to Moonside� will explore the relationship between memory and mental clarity, asking audiences to help our characters dive into their own history at a time of political crisis. It is our hope that our audience members will forge real connections with our characters, bringing their own personal experiences to a resonant, yet fictional, setting. Vigilance Theater Group presented our debut production, ""Hollow Moon,"" in November 2018. ""Welcome to Moonside"" is a shared-universe follow-up to that production; many of you wanted to know more about the ghostly visitor that haunted ""Hollow Moon."" In ""Welcome to Moonside,"" your questions will be answered. The money raised through Kickstarter will assist our efforts in securing a budget for the location, set dressing, and technical needs to help bring our vision to life."

I often hear fans say, �Why are there so few good sci-fi shows on TV, and why do so many go south?� I can tell you � frankly, most of the network suits just don�t get it. But you and I do. So when I recently got the idea of creating a new show inspired by the sense of wonder and possibility science fiction gave me as a kid, I realized I didn�t need a network or studio to make my dream come true -- just Kickstarter and you. Thanks for making it happen."" These are some of the science fiction icons that support Space Command"

It�s called �The Shade from Our Trees� and you can download it from my website, stream it on the platform of your choice, or be a hero and help Kickstart it! Where have I been, you ask? After making a dozen albums and hundreds of songs non-stop for over a decade, I was feeling pretty burned out. I decided to just take some time off to recharge my battery until I was feeling truly inspired to make more music. That finally came this year, and I�ve been working feverishly ever since to finish this album! ""The Shade from Our Trees"" has been a long time in the making, which seems oddly appropriate given the source of the title. The album's roots came as the second half of a double-album called ""Feathers and Tethers"", where ""Feathers"" was the light CD, and ""Tethers"" was the dark one. As I was close to releasing it, I realized it was way too dark, even for me. I cannibalized a couple of songs from it to put on what became ""Addressed to the Stars"", and let the rest gather dust. When I came back to the project with fresh ears, I started working on new material to pull the album together and make it more balanced. I ended up abandoning most of the original project to make room for the newer material I was writing. The result is maybe the most ambitious project I�ve tackled to date, incorporating a lot of new sounds into my music. In addition to the album itself, backers with $5+ pledges will get a digital EP of updated versions of the previously released songs that didn't make it onto the album, the original acoustic version of Vanishing Note, the original upbeat version of The Maze, and an unreleased track. Everyone at the $30+ tiers get their name in the liner notes of the album, along with a photo of me holding a personalized thank-you note. There's a $50 package for those of you who don't need a shiny disc, but who want basically every digital goodie I can throw at them. And for the truly adventurous, TinyTune commissions are back! Thank you all so much for the support. I love you all!"

STRETCHIER GOALS: Ok, full disclosure, you guys cleaned us out in the stretch goal department. Due to the time constraints we have with our printing schedule and availability constraints of our artist, there aren't any additional physical changes we can make at this point. In fact, all files except for the rules and the punch board layouts are already being reviewed so we can start printing next month. The good news here is that you've unlocked the full game as we envisioned it, and that you'll receive it in a fraction of the time that many other projects take. Games will ship in October (barring any mishap), just over 4 months from now. However, that doesn't mean we don't want to continue to award you for your support of the project. So, we've devised a few additional add-ons that we will be delivering to you between now and the time the game eventually ships.

With five games in our line-up, thousands of Amazon reviews, and hundreds of thousands of fans of our games, launching a game on Kickstarter might seem like an odd choice. We have the funding, the game's design is almost complete, and we're experienced in the production process. The reason we are here is simple. We designed our first couple of games for the family market. Our last couple of releases, Skull King + Legendary Expansion, The Bears and The Bees, and now Cover Your Kingdom, are still excellent games for families to play. However, with their more advanced mechanics they have sufficient depth and strategy to find broader appeal at the tables of casual and hobby gamers as well. They have been warmly received and well reviewed by many within these groups, but we are still relatively unknown in the gaming community as a whole. That is the reason we made the decision to launch Cover Your Kingdom on Kickstarter. It's also why we are offering our best pricing of all time when you purchase a bundle of this new game along with our other 3 best sellers. All three are included for $24, or $8 each (50 cents over wholesale), when you buy them together with a copy of Cover Your Kingdom. We strongly believe that if you buy the games, and try them, that you'll love them and share them with those you play with. If you love the games, we know that when you teach them to those you play with, that they will them too. They'll also love you for introducing them to these excellent games that we stand behind 100% as a family. From our table to yours, Grandpa Beck - Grandpa Beck's Games Special Thanks This game was created with the help of too many people to thank by name, but there were a few individuals who provided a tremendous amount of support, guidance, and advice during play testing, development, and preparing this campaign that we'd like to thank by name.

Disinfection of the car ventilation system -- nothing can do this better than ozonized air ECO-FRIENDLY technology WONDERTOOL� THE SECRET is saturating the water with OZONE � ozone naturally defends and cleans our planet. Everyone remembers that fresh air smell left from a thunder and lightning storm - the ozone made it that way! The benefit of ozone treatment is derived from its strong oxidation potential and ability to transform and degrade most organic substances. The ozone works by breaking down the molecular bonds that hold grime to your clothes. Ozone makes this breakdown faster and more reliable than detergents, and it doesn't leave any chemical contamination in water and clothes. And you need fresh air in the house � make it happen with WONDERTOOL� � it's a BONUS. WONDERTOOL� does your laundry anywhere and doesn't need a fixed connection to water supply and drain. The ergonomic design includes a durable handle for easy carrying, and a strong, tightly closing lid for loading and unloading your laundry. WONDERTOOL� work from AC 110-240 v, as well as from the car lighter DC 12 v. Weight without loading - 11 lb (5 kg) and capable of washing up to - 6 lb (3kg). Dimensions - 13 ""15 ""13"" You can put WONDERTOOL� anywhere: on the floor, in the shower cabin, in the bath, on the table or countertop and even on the ground near the house or car. For safe use of WONDERTOOL� in high humidity conditions, we specifically use a low-volt safety supply of DC 12V, as in your car. Power supply unit with a long 15 ft power supply cable, an additional 15 ft cable for connecting to a car lighter, 7 ft silicone hose for dry-cleaning ozone supply, an outlet converter WONDERTOOL� makes your life easier and compatible w/ Sonoff WiFi Smart ON/OFF Timer, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit & Google Assistant WE DEVELOPED A NEW (patent-pending) PORTABLE METHOD WASHING WITH OZONE FOR HOUSEHOLD USE: FIRST, we use an innovative dispersant-aerator made from nanotubes for the continuous saturation of water with ozone. As the ozonated water comes in contact with the tissues, ozone begins to destroy contaminants and attacks bacteria and mold so that they can be easily removed from the washable clothes. Best of all, chemical washing detergents are no longer needed. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 SECOND, we use two powerful compressors to create a strong ascending flow of the ozone-air mixture. Millions of ozone bubbles knock contaminants from your clothes. The ascending airflow carries them out through a hole at the very top. Pollution doesn�t stand a chance of staying in clothes and washing doesn't need harsh, harmful chemicals. No warm water is needed � in fact, OZONE is a powerful and safe cleaning agent that disinfects laundry using mostly cool water. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Rice, PhD and Marc DeBrum ""The Ozone Laundry Handbook"" WONDERTOOL � SOLVES MANY OF YOUR DAILY LAUNDRY PROBLEMS: SPORTSWEAR gets dirty and smelly every day and is often needed the next day. With WONDERTOOL� your favorite sportswear will be clean without chemical powder inside Daily wear: shirts, blouses and personal items require that fresh and clean look. And you don't need someone else's mud on them from the public laundromat. Why accumulate children's clothing in the laundry basket? To make it even dirtier due to cross-contamination of other bacteria? Or waiting to accommodate a small wash in-between big load? But most of all, kids clothes accumulate every day, and they are always very lacking. Don't you want to solve this problem without the risk of washing powder and germs on your delicate babies skin? Detergents adhere strongly to tissues and even repeatedly rinsing clothes in clean water doesn't allow them to be completely removed. It is always on our skin, and absorbed, causing allergic reactions and more serious health problems. The main role of detergents is to reduce contamination and the bonding of molecules to textiles. The same task is successfully solved with the help of ozone, and no more chemicals for washing clothes when you have the WONDERTOOL� Ironically the very detergents that we normally use to get our clothes �clean� may actually be leaving them worse off than they were before we ran the wash When you first switch to laundry your clothes w/ WONDERTOOL�, you will have suds whether or not you add any soap. There are so much residual soap and chemicals in your clothes after traditional laundering methods that you will be amazed. Switch to ozone washing w/ WONDERTOOL� and stop all those chemicals from getting on the skin and inside your body. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Regular washing machines don't kill enough pathogenic germs with normal temperature treatment, turning your laundry into a bacterial danger. Good bio-security practices - using the biocidal properties of ozone to remove dirt and microbes from your laundry reduces and even eliminates the need for harsh detergents for washing. Allergic reactions are eliminated due to residues of biocides in washed clothes and it becomes sterile and naturally fresh when you have the WONDERTOOL� Ozone laundering eradicates 99.9 % of bacteria and viruses in less than a few minutes, and this isn't an achievable result for traditional heat treatment Studies of traditional thermal washing have shown that only exposure to water at a temperature of 160�F (71�C) for 25 minutes will lead to the death of almost all pathogens. The process also needs a dizzying set of toxic chemicals, including Chlorine, which you absolutely don't want to take. Ozone first oxidizes and destroys bacteria, viruses, parasites, and then turns into oxygen. WONDERTOOL� replaces most of the chemicals needed to achieve an excellent end result only cold ozone saturated water. Don't worry about damaging your expensive clothes made from natural silk and cashmere, there�s no need to sort clothes into different fabrics or colours for separate loads. Clothes become softer, fluffier, and fabric life is extended longer. Ozonated cold water will change your wash and you don't have to worry about damaged clothes when using the WONDERTOOL�. What you are left with are clean clothes free of any smells, grime or chemicals. And don't worry about the coloured clothes - WONDERTOOL� is washing in cold water - the colours stay in place Degradation of the clothes textile takes in the traditional wash wheel, where dynamic loads of twisting and stretching in hot water with caustic chemicals wear out and abrade the fabric. WONDERTOOL� ozone washing by curtailing the chemicals and by decreasing the water temperature and have resulted in a more than 50% reduction in fabric degradation.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 When clothes are worn even for a short time, a bad smell may be absorbed into the fabric, although the clothes are generally unsoiled. Examples can include adsorption of cigarette smoke into clothes, the smell of sweat, or removal of perfume traces. In this case, clothes, as a rule, don't have to be washed, but removing the adsorbed odour and isolation of bacteria is required. Save time and money on dry cleaning with WONDERTOOL� You just need to put the clothes in a plastic bag and send dry OZONE there with a silicone hose from WONDERTOOL� WONDERTOOL� is great for dry cleaning and removing unpleasant smells (sweat, tobacco, etc.) from your clothes, shoes and other things, including children's toys (made of fabric) and pillows. WONDERTOOL� also removes 99.9% of known pathogenic microbes and viruses. Just put the dirty items inside (without water) and set the timer for 15 minutes. WONDERTOOL � is ideal for cleaning even sneakers - remove these smelly smells from your shoes yourself Hand-washing fruits and vegetables remove only about 90% of pesticides and germs. But the ozone successfully disinfects and kill 99.9% bacteria while reducing water and energy consumption. This is more difficult to do with traditional methods of washing using a lot of hot water and even bactericides in sterilization. WONDERTOOL � - the best bio-protection practice - keep your healthy by providing protection from bacteria and agro-chemicals! Ozone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antimicrobial agent in 2001 and it has since been used to combat bacteria and chemical residue WONDERTOOL� in just a few minutes gently washes fruits, berries, vegetables and salad greens to 99.9% purity WONDERTOOL� can prepare ozone-charged water for cleaning in the house � germs and bacteria will be destroyed. The ozone creates a more powerful and less selective secondary oxidant, hydroxyl radicals, in the water. The hydroxyl radical has a much higher oxidation potential than ozone and requires even less time of contact of ozonated water with bacteria for their complete destruction. But it's necessary to use freshly prepared water, ozone very quickly returns to normal oxygen. This is the best way to ensure uncompromised cleanliness in the house. And this can't be achieved without ozone-saturated water from WONDERTOOL� WONDERTOOL� sterilizes many items: kids toys, kitchen tools and personal hygiene products. Only one warning - ozone during a very long and repeated exposure can deteriorate rubber products. When was the last time you cleaned your razor, toothbrush, or make-up brush? With WONDERTOOL� you can finally clean it all back to its original sterile cleanliness. After this, ozonated water is very useful to water the houseplants so you protect them from fungi and harmful microbes. Is Mold or Bacteria Inside Baby Toys Making Your Child Sick? WONDERTOOL� cleans the air in the house and destroys 99.9% of microbes and viruses. It successfully removes unpleasant cigarette and mold smells. Remember, during the air purification process, people and animals can't be in the room, and after that, it is necessary to ventilate the room well. Everyone remembers the clean air after a thunder and lightning storm � it�s the ozone that washed it! WONDERTOOL� will bring this wonderful natural effect into your home. WONDERTOOL� can be connected to any home outlet (110-240 v). If you want to wash clothes or fruit outside the house, there is a power cable that runs from your 12-volt car cigarette lighter. WONDERTOOL� work in manual mode - use only the on / off switch and the 60 minutes timer. The washing time and the amount of loading should be determined by testing and your preferences. Usually, 10 minutes for washing and 5 minutes for rinsing are sufficient. It's very simple and reliable. WONDERTOOL� is made for a maximum operating time of 60 minutes. Use 60 minutes to clean the air of foreign smells and infections in the house (and even your car and boat). You will get great air quality in a house without allergens, germs, dust and therefore a better quality of life. Remember, during the air purification process, people and animals can't be in the room, and after that, it is necessary to ventilate the room well. WONDERTOOL � is indispensable for cleaning the car interior from odors and, more importantly, from harmful bacteria linked to meningitis and septicemia found blowing around car air conditioning systems. For this, monthly 15-minute treatments of the passenger compartment with ozonized air are sufficient with the ventilation system running. �I�m sure if car owners knew what they were blowing out of their air conditioning vents they would think twice before switching them on this summer� - Dr. Paul Matewele, senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 SAFETY: WONDERTOOL� can do it all, but ozone can be dangerous if handled incorrectly, (so can your car). Ozone is a strong oxidizer that is generally not harmful to human and mammals at low concentrations, but homicidal to microorganisms such as bacteria. You must respect the oxidative powers of ozone and treat it accordingly. We thoroughly tested and selected the necessary power of the ozone generator so that it completely dissolves in the water. Nevertheless, some ozone will be released into the environment. Therefore, it is important to use WONDERTOOL� together with the ventilation included and don't stay long in the same room while it works. Ozone will do its job and very quickly convert back to oxygen. Ozone is used in swimming pools, hospitals, and hotels for water disinfection and air freshening. It can also be used to clean industrial and domestic laundries and effectively combat pollution and save the environment from chemical detergents. Ozone has been approved by the FDA, USDA, and the EPA as an antimicrobial disinfectant.

I also have two children under the age of four and am all-too familiar with picture books (AKA board books). As I was reading an ABC book to my son it occurred to me, there aren't any children's books on Cyber Security. I wanted to make a fun illustration that makes security concepts easy to understand but are enjoyable for the adults as well. I'm hoping there are other InfoSec Moms and Dads out there like me. I'm unsure if I'll create more than the initial 500 copies, so sign up here to reserve your copy! The book cover in the image above and the ""U is for Unauthorized Access"" page should give you an idea for what each page will look like. Unique monsters will be on each page for every letter of the alphabet, done by this same multi-award winning children's illustrator. Although there isn't a lot of text in the book aside from the alphabet terms, I plan to add a privacy page at the end, stressing the importance to children about not talking with strangers online, giving up personal information, and not clicking on ads, etc. If you're a company, there's a single quantity pledge that will get your company logo branded on the back of the book as the official corporate sponsor! In addition to this I'll find a fitting place to put your logo into the actual story as well. Additionally, there are two pledge rewards available for secondary corporate sponsors. For these I will also add them into the story line, either on a hacker hoodie or hacker stickers on a laptop, for example. It also occurred to me that these books could be given during trade shows and security conferences by companies. If you're anything like me, I take most of my ""swag"" home to my kids anyways, so why not give out something relevant and educational? Or, maybe you have an executive team that could use them. ;) If funding exceeds my 100% Kickstarter goal, I plan to put that money back into additional copies so more children and parents can have access to this book. I apologize for those of you not in the United States or Canada. I enabled support for other countries but shipping is more expensive."

While babysitting a precocious 6 year old, Mia is stalked by a shadowy presence that trips the home security system. As loud beeps sound off whenever a door or window is opened, the system meant to protect her becomes an amplifying terror while she attempts to survive the night. Safe and Sound is an atmospheric love letter to all things 70s/80s Steven Spielberg & John Carpenter. Growing up in the suburbs, I�ve always had a deep fondness for horror and science fiction that revolved around contemporary, everyday life. Visually stunning films that brought the impossible what-ifs and terrifying unknown into our homes and leave you questioning every bump in the night. Late one night while staying with my girlfriend's family (watching a horror film no less), we both hear the ominous beep-beep of the home security system. Already primed and on edge from the film, it took us a moment to rationalize what could have opened or closed in the house. We quickly came to the conclusion that it was her grandmother opening a window and since we survived the night, that was most likely the case. ...but what if it wasn't? We were so conditioned to the security system's beeps that someone or something could have gotten inside and we would be none the wiser. Over the following months, Joshua Storms and I crafted that moment into a tight, tension filled sci-fi nightmare. The best horror films submerge themselves in social commentary and Safe and Sound is no different. There�s a lot of uncertainty in the world right now. While people want to feel secure and rely on the news/leaders to tell them everything is okay, it can become a repeating signal of anxiety and stress. Even worse is growing accustomed to the bad news and falling into complacency. What I want to explore and capture in this short is the concept that the very thing that should be helping and supporting Mia is actually terrorizing her. Each time the security system beeps is a moment of horror and not of safety. We are looking for $10,000 in addition to our own funds to cover production costs and will shoot the film this summer. Halloween Moody and atmospheric, inspired by the heavy anamorphic style of 70s and 80s cinema. We�ll build the tone and feel with ambient sources; warm lamps and accent lights of the home mixing with the cold teal blast of motion sensing lights surrounding the house. We want to embrace the dark corners of a tranquil environment, a familiar, yet stylized look of an older suburban home. Let Me In Using the JAWS approach of less-is-more, we�ll thoughtfully frame and light to avoid revealing too much of the creature, leaving it mostly in the darkness and only seeing the movements of its grotesque shadow. In the end, immersive sound design will do the heavy lifting when it comes to portraying the stalking monster. Although we are planning for some limited digital effects, I want to capture as much of the blood and terror in camera.

Gideon Ira: Knight of the Blood Cross is the first novel in my new series of Christian Pulp stories, Deus Vult Wastelanders. The initial books follow Gideon Ira, a young knight in power armor as he traverses a post-apocalyptic wasteland America full of demons, necromancers, warlocks, vicious bandits, and savage warlords. The Church has unified into one community of believers, though friendly denominational factions remain and support one another because this is not a time to be divided. Gideon Ira is Catholic himself while his best friend is a member of the Assemblies of God. Holy knights guard the huddled masses of survivors in the shelter of walled city-states. Mankind has largely forgotten the ability to forge advanced tech, so they preserve the existing power armor, plasma swords, and heavy weaponry like holy relics. Gideon Ira: Knight of the Blood Cross opens with the wandering knight in desperate battle against a demon of pride. He's tracked the hulking monster to its lair, and the audience gets to see a range of special abilities supplied by Gideon's power armor. He takes the severed head back to the nearby border village where the hunt was commissioned and dumps it off at the local church for cataloging and disposal. When he hears the resurgent cult of Ba'al up north has laid waste to an entire village in order to harvest their children for living sacrifice, Gideon sets off on a journey across the wasteland. The entire journey takes him to many locations: The ruins of a megacity populated by demons and cultists, the holy city of Belltower run by the Church, the demonic mirror world which lays beneath our own, cracked highways turned into gory battlefields, and across the flowering wasteland of a broken America. Several battles are gritty and brutal, real slugfests with huge swords and claws, while another adventure requires Gideon to work with a team of stealthy fellow knights operating with military precision as they seek to abduct the wicked Blackthorne. Gideon faces angels both fallen and faithful, articulate demons who seek to destroy his soul, and witches and warlocks commanding unholy powers. The goal of this series is to create stories to inspire Christians with a new wave of heroic figures living out their faith in uncompromising ways. I'm studying the pulp writers who brought us Conan the Barbarian, Solomon Kane, Tarzan of the Apes, and John Carter of Mars, and my goal is to write blistering page-turners to keep Christian audiences begging for more. What's the money for? This Kickstarter campaign is to help the author pay for cover art, professional editing, and professional formatting for both ebook and paperback editions. The rough draft of the story is already finished and currently stands at around 53,000 words prior to self editing and professional editing. My tendency as a writer is to increase the number of words during self editing because I leave description out of the rough draft, so that word count is likely to increase. The professional editor for this novel has worked on a wide range of novels and is already booked for August. He also holds a degree in theology, and I've got several members of multiple denominations ready to review the final copy and make sure it's friendly for all Christian audiences. The cover art for Gideon Ira: Knight of the Blood Cross is designed to look face-meltingly awesome, likely with the titular knight in power armor, his weapons, and a scattering of demonic enemies. My goal is to have art so beautiful that people will want to hang enlarged versions up as posters in their bedrooms. Renowned artist Ivan Tao has already agreed to do the work and is booked for August. Examples of his professional work can be found at https://www.artstation.com/ivantao. All backers will receive their digital copy of the novel at least 2 weeks in advance of the book being available for sale anywhere else. Backers are welcome to publish reviews as they wish upon receiving the novel and do not have to wait for the street date. The book is yours at that point to discuss to your heart's content. A short appetizer The first unedited chapter is included below to give backers a taste for what they can expect from the story: Chapter 1: Deep in a reeking pit in the earth, a knight in power armor challenged a feathery demon. Two gasping torches hurled in haste upon the floor splashed light over the duel and revealed the nest of the foul monstrosity. Human bones crunched underfoot and putrid soil lined all other sides in the crude cavern, the last in a mazelike warren of twisting rabbit tunnels. Like sentinels of death, bleached skulls embedded in the walls with jaws agape shrieked empty songs audible only to the damned. Metal rang and breath chuffed as the combatants stirred the bones at their feet and clashed once more. The stalwart knight stood his ground even as a rain of blows fell upon him in a waterfall of death. Claws like daggers scraped his gunmetal gray armor, seeking purchase in the dark gaps between. The armor�s gilded edges reflected like gold sunlight in the flickering light of the torch. A bloodred ragged cross was painted across the warrior�s breastplate. As soon as the demon�s attacks dwindled, the knight whirled into his counterattack. The crimson loincloth draped from his belt stirred with the movement, and the half-cape of the same color over his left shoulder snapped as the attacker pirouetted and slashed with his enormous two-handed greatsword. As tall as a man and a foot wide, the blade whistled as it cut the stagnant air of the stinking cavern. Golden glowing eyes set into the knight�s helm blazed like starlight as he struck again and again at the monstrous beast. For its part, the feathery demon withstood the flurry of attacks. Like a hulking ape covered in obsidian insect chitin, the enormous opponent repelled every attack, no matter how ferocious. The demon stood three times the height of a man so its head, like the head of an iguana and covered in the same gleaming black chitin, nearly scraped the cavern ceiling as it whipped back and forth to track the knight. Craggy thorns as long as a man�s arm intermixed with vibrant peacock feathers rising from all over the demon�s body reached to gore the knight at each opportunity. When the massive charcoal-gray greatsword proved ineffective, the knight pushed off with his foot and launched himself backward. The power of his suit augmented his strength and gave the backstep a reach of fifteen feet. Upon gaining some distance, the knight reached for his hip. A wide leather gunbelt hung askew across his armored hips. With the greatsword held tight in his left hand, the knight drew a silver-plated hand cannon from the holster and fired. The crash of gunfire tore through the underground cavern. The .50 caliber bullet ripped through the air and crashed into the hulking demon�s shoulder. Despite the power of the round, the bullet pinged off the tough chitin armor. The shot was powerful enough to stagger the beast, but no more. Not content to be fired upon, the gleaming demon roared and charged. Reeking earth flew like blowing curtains as the massive clawed feet churned the floor and propelled the monster forward in the blink of an eye. The knight barely had time to roll aside before the beast hurtled into the space where he�d been and slammed into the wall behind him. From the floor, the knight fired twice more at close range. The huge gun thundered in his hands, and once more his helm�s auditory dampeners kicked in to save the prone man�s hearing. Even as his shots rebounded off the monster�s back, the knight pushed himself to his feet again and whirled his greatsword for a one-handed overhead slash. His suit�s maintenance was so thorough he could not even hear the servos whirring as the powered arms augmented his attack and slammed the sword against the demon�s flank with the force of a freight train. Uncowed by the hit, the demon backhanded the knight with a hand the size of a car door. The metal armor rang like a gong and the knight flew across the cavern. His back slammed into the packed earth wall and he collapsed to the floor in a clatter of bones. Both weapons had dropped from his hands during his flight. The beast roared hideous laughter. The sound boomed in the tight confines of the cursed lair. The knight reached for his belt pouch and drew out a rosary. Sandy wooden beads rattled along the length of tan parachute chord. The steel crucifix on the end flashed in the torchlight. The knight wrapped the rosary around his gauntleted fist and struck a battle stance. When he roared his challenge, the scrapper�s voice resonated through the chamber and silenced the demon�s laughter. �Come at me, filthy churl,� the knight shouted. �I shall crush you with faith alone.� Snarling, the beast complied. Its charge was faster than the blink of an eye, its fist rising to crush the knight where he stood. The knight slipped by his attacker�s fist. The wind of the passing attack stirred his cloth drapings once more. With a roar, the faithful warrior threw his entire strength into a punch which slammed the iguana jaw of the hulking monstrosity. At the instant of impact, a flaring light burst forth from the rosary. The demon screamed and twisted away to avoid contact, but the knight lashed out again and punched the demon in its torso. The blow caused another flash of light. Where the punches had landed, smoke curled up from the scarred chitin. Suddenly wary, the huge monster threw itself across the cavern to escape. The knight made to pursue but his boot caught on the hilt of his greatsword and he stumbled. He lifted the enormous blade from the pile of rattling bones and hefted it in an overhead guard. The demon snarled at him from across the room. Inside his helm, the knight smiled. With his finger, he flicked the switch hidden inside the cross guard of his greatsword. The sharpened edge split apart as the blade butterflied open on both sides down the center spine. A roaring jet of golden plasma burst forth from the edges of the sword and threw surging shadows through the demon�s lair. At the same time, the knight used his tongue to flick a switch inside his helm. The golden edges of his armor lit up as bright as the sun, surging into sudden radiance. For the demon, the effect was like staring into the heart of the Sun itself. The beast roared in agony and covered its face with both hands to block the painful light. A countdown inside the knight�s helm started up, ticking down from 60 seconds in the top right corner of his vision. As the plasma blade thrummed in hands, the counter fell to 59 seconds, then 58. The HUD displayed the numbers in vivid red. Another warning along the bottom right of his HUD read Flash disabled. Recharge time: 120 minutes. With no time to lose, the knight rushed to the attack. His plasma sword bit into the beast�s arm but failed to fully penetrate the chitin. By knocking the limb aside, he was able to drive his blade into a thrust directly at the scarred chitin on the beast�s torso where his blessed rosary had burned the monster. The plasma blade tore through the chitin and into the flesh beneath. The demon, which had been swinging blindly as it defended itself from the unseen foe, lashed out in all directions. Blue ichor squirted from the wound and splashed across the reeking earth at the knight�s feet. Ignoring the splashing blood and the swinging attacks, the knight stepped under the flailing arms and slashed his plasma blade at the demon�s face. The sword connected but the monster twisted away at the last second, so the blade failed to plunge through. The knight had been aiming for the scarred chitin along the monster�s jaw where he�d punched its face but the dodge caused the weapon to scrape along the apelike demon�s eye. With a burst of fluid the eye exploded and the beast shrieked in agony. Another backhand hurled the knight back ten feet. His armored greaves skidded through the bones and shattered them to dust beneath his heels. As he slid to a stop, his HUD read 30 seconds. The blinded demon recovered vision in its remaining eye and fixed the dark orb on its tormenter. With a cry of fury, the monster charged forward. The knight hurled himself into the attack. His plasma sword burned through the air as the countdown continued to tick toward depletion. The monster reached with both claws to snag the knight. The knight allowed himself to be caught around the waist, with both arms over his head. With a cry of triumph, the demon squeezed with all its might, attempting to crush the knight. In the bottom left of the knight�s vision, the words Armor integrity decreasing appeared. An outline of his body showed yellow around his lower abdomen, and the color was quickly burning toward a darker orange. Trusting his armor to hold, the knight lined up a swing and slashed his plasma blade against the side of the demon�s face. The plasma sword bit deep into the scarred chitin along the jaw and into the cratered eye socket. With a sizzle, the blade bit through the side of the beast�s face and into the meat beneath. The huge body jerked as plasma incinerated its brain and central nervous system. While not native to the material plane, the demon was forced to abide by the laws of living creatures when inhabiting a body. That meant a brain to house the spirit-body connectors. As for any living creature, destroying the brain meant separation of spirit and body. The clawed hands around the knight maintained their grip for another moment before falling away. With a crunch, the limp corpse collapsed into the piles of bones and moved no more. With 10 seconds left on the countdown, the knight pressed the switch under the cross guard on his sword once more. The golden plasma ceased to flow, the sword edges closed into a normal sword blade, and the countdown in his HUD disappeared. With a flick of his eyes, the knight activated his gear search. The sword in his hand lit up as white light outlined the weapon. Across the room, another white outline showed him the location of his lost hand cannon. Bones crunched underfoot as the knight strode to his pistol and lifted it up to check for damage. Satisfied that the weapon was intact, he slid it back into its holster and turned to regard the fallen demon. �I require your head,� the knight declared to the lump of armored meat."

I specifically wanted Kayla to learn from Sarah Bernhardt, her idol and legendary actress from the late 19th century who was an unstoppable force of nature on stage and in life. It's Sarah Bernhardt's boldness to forge your own path in life - and in your career - that inspires Kayla, and I believe will inspire audiences as well. - Kathleen Barth (Writer and Director) The Story When aspiring actress, Kayla auditions for the title role in her college�s production of Hamlet, she nearly flops at the audition. But Sarah Bernhardt, the legendary actress from the turn of the century � and Kayla�s acting idol � mysteriously emerges onstage to help Kayla with her audition. But undergoing Sarah Bernhardt�s intensive training proves to be far more difficult than Kayla imagined. The Director's Vision In this project�s infancy, the production team and I brainstormed concepts for a short film and it was then that I created the story for �The Audition�. When I officially took on the responsibility of writing the screenplay for our team's short film, I decided to write a story about two women with a master and apprentice relationship dynamic . I also loved the idea of setting this film in a theatre. I mean, write what you know, right? Yet I also wanted to give this story a splash of fantasy and have the master in this dynamic be an historical figure who magically emerges to life on stage. It took me two seconds to decide that this historical figure must be Sarah Bernhardt. Sarah Bernhardt is a legendary French theatre actress from the turn of the century, and she even crossed over into film during the early days of French cinema. She performed and lived her life in an over the top fashion, yet it was her bold performance of Hamlet that solidified her place in the acting firmament. And in playing Hamlet, Sarah Bernhardt proved that a woman�s role is whatever she chooses it be. And that boldness inspires Kayla, the young actress in this story, as well as artists today. I mean without Sarah Bernhardt�s Hamlet, we wouldn�t have Glenda Jackson playing King Lear on Broadway right now. Sarah Bernhardt�s fierceness and determination to forge her own path and challenge the status quo clearly continues inspiring artists and other professionals alike. When writing Kayla, the young aspiring actress in this story, I was inspired by my own journey as a young actress studying performance in undergrad. Like me, Kayla struggles getting out of her head and embodying the physical and emotional life of a character. Yet during her magical master class with Sarah Bernhardt, Kayla gets the opportunity she desperately needs to nail her audition and improve her craft as an actress. When I swapped my writer hat for my director one, I sought to create two worlds for this film, and therefore, two stages: one that exists in reality, and another full of fantasy. In reality, the audience gets a peak into the world of collegiate theatre and the experience of auditioning. As a trained actor, and now as a director, I have worked on both sides of an audition and I wanted to evoke the experiences of an actor and of the director during an audition. I especially wanted to reveal how vulnerable actors often feel during an audition, particularly when their audition isn�t going well. This is what Kayla experiences during her initial audition: she feels infinitely small in front of a sea of unfriendly eyes while standing alone on a vast and empty stage. Yet when Kayla hits rock bottom during her audition, she finds herself transported to a sort of dual dimension, or fantasy world. In creating the fantasy world, I wanted to give the stage the appearance of a void where darkness engulfs the space. Yet in this void Sarah Bernhardt, along with characters from Hamlet, seemingly emerge from the darkness and onto the stage. I also wanted to establish Sarah Bernhardt as the ringmaster in this void; she can appear and disappear at will, and she ultimately wields the power to summon other entities onto the stage. I also set out to evoke how mentally and emotionally exhausting one-on-one acting coaching can be. During Kayla�s master class with Sarah Bernhardt, mental and emotional exhaustion gradually seeps into Kayla and I wanted the audience to go on that journey with her. As Sarah Bernhardt pushes and pushes Kayla, the audience will also feel the strain that continually performing weighs on her. Yet when an actor veers on the verge of their breaking point, that�s when they often let go of their inhibitions and a new kind of magic happens as the actor fully embodies their character. This is the moment that Sarah Bernhardt is trying to push Kayla toward, and the audience will follow Kayla to see if she breaks or triumphs. Amid the fantastical elements of this film, �The Audition� ultimately portrays the tale of a young woman determined to step into a man�s role while receiving help from a woman who did it over a century earlier. As the writer and director for �The Audition�, I want viewers to adopt Sarah Bernhardt�s fierce methodology: a woman�s role can be the same as a man�s, and that the only limits we have are the ones we place in front of ourselves.

WE'RE FULLY FUNDED! THANK YOU! HELP US HIT OUR STRETCH GOALS! -If we hit 28.5K, we�ll produce at least seven sketches. -If we hit 32K, we�ll add at least two more sketches to the block (8). -If we hit 40k, we�ll make at least nine sketches AND a multi-episode mini series. -And if we somehow hit 50K, we�ll make a full year of sketches (12) and a multi-episode mini series. Last Friday night, in the middle of a live stream, we hit our $25,000 goal and passed 100% funded (check out the moment it happened here: https://youtu.be/wOyNPR9WZ70?t=4913). We can't believe we got here so quickly, and we can't believe so many of you are out there supporting us. We're so happy, so grateful and so excited to make these sketches. Like, for real, we're so freaking pumped. We'll be reaching out in the weeks ahead to fulfill all of your rewards, and we'll keep you posted as we move forward. And to encourage you in this final stretch we're adding two new rewards! If you jump in now at the $10 level, we'll shout you out in a live stream and send you a handful of limited edition pieces of Chris and Jack artwork for download. And with limited availability, for $500, we'll send you a special prop from one of our past sketches, along with some autographs and a real nice note! Again, we really can't thank you all enough, and this is all icing on the cake. If you don't feel like donating anymore (which we totally understand!) feel free to share the campaign to anyone you think might get a kick out of what we're doing. Thank you thank you thank you!!!! We won't let you down! ----------- Hi there! We�re Chris and Jack! We�ve been dear friends and collaborators for over a decade and for the last three years we�ve been writing/directing/editing and starring in sketches for our Youtube channel. Since we started the channel, our focus has been on delivering high-quality silliness. We love sketch comedy. We love crafting these odd little worlds and dropping you right in. We love playing with genres, drawing inspiration from our shared passion for sci-fi, heist films, and the like. And we love to sneak in some heart where you may not expect it. We set out to become better filmmakers, to try to make each other laugh, and to share that with an audience. And to that end, we�ve been incredibly lucky. We�ve found an unbelievably supportive community online. With a little over ninety thousand subscribers, we know there�s a growing fanbase for what we�re doing�finding those people and interacting with them has been awesome. We love making these things and sharing them with you all and we don�t want it to stop. So we�re reaching out for help to produce a block of 6 new sketches for the channel. We�re really proud that our stuff feels consistently high quality, but that takes a lot of time and a lot of money. When we�re playing with film genres, high production value, or at least the appearance there-of, really helps you buy in quickly so we can get straight to the funny. We like awesome sets, complicated make-up, sweet visual effects, and, most importantly, a fantastic crew. A huge part of how we get a professional feel is that our crews are always full of actual professionals (a director of photography, gaffer, grips, sound, make-up, post, art department, costumes�whatever the sketch calls for.). We�re in LA and our friends are super talented working pros, and while we�re not paying them anywhere near what they usually make, it�s important to us that we honor their hard work and pay them what we can. And so while we stretch every dollar, and use every shortcut and favor, it all adds up. We�ve been lucky enough in the past to get some funding from outside groups, but the bulk of it has been out of pocket, and we just can�t keep it up right now. $25,000 would give us a flexible budget to create at least six sketches. If we can stretch it, we�ll make more. Historically, our average sketch runs us around $3500. There are a lot of costs that are a given for every sketch (equipment rentals, insurance, crew, food), but for everything else we really try to put our money where the sketch needs it most. If we can get away with shooting for free in an apartment, we absolutely will. If instead, we�ve gotta get the perfect warehouse space, great, but then we'll figure out how to make that crazy prop from scratch for ten bucks. Sometimes we�ll sit on a script for a while, waiting until we can figure out how to make it affordably. Like this one: Thanks to the Youtube Space LA, we got the chance to film for free on a set from Alien: Covenant, so we figured out the rest and pulled out True Friendship, a script we weren�t sure we�d ever be able to shoot. Point being, whatever our budget is, we�re gonna find every way we can to get even more production value on your screen. With $25,000, we'll be able to meet all of the built-in costs of shooting these sketches and maintaining our channel, have the ability to spring for some special elements if the idea calls for it, and have some contingency funds to deal with all the unforeseen craziness of filmmaking. We'd jump straight to work and bring the channel back in full force this fall. We're not trying to pay ourselves with this. Whatever money our channel generates right now goes straight back into the sketches. We're doing it because we love making this stuff and sharing it around. And because we get to have days like these: Thanks so much for considering us! -Chris & Jack"

The game is Powered by the Apocalypse, meaning it uses the rules found in Apocalypse World as a foundation, and builds from there. In Rust Hulks, you will play as the crew of a large, derelict spaceship. You will fly around the solar system picking up jobs, earning credits, scraping through hulks, improving your skills, and expanding your ship. On its face, it's simple; in practice, it gets messy fast: You're aboard a flying scrapheap halfway to Mars and three of your fuel canisters blow; the crew, while tentative friends, are mostly here for money�when things go real south, what will you do? If you grit your teeth and drive hard bargains, you'll make it out the other side. Profit, even, if you're lucky. If you can't cut it, well, let's just say there'll be one more hulk out there for the scavengers. The game is, at its core, about going through highly tense and stressful situations as a group, and examining the relationships that form and break because of it. Rust Hulks is like Alien. Or Firefly. Or some parts of Star Wars. Everything is used, rusty, and worn-down. Your ship is cannibalized from a dozen other ships and tweaked or patched with every piece of junk and scrap you can find. It's really less a singular ship than it is a collection of individual rooms, held together with shoestrings and chewing gum. There are no laser blasters, no energy shields, and no gleaming computers. Instead, there are wooden crates, canned rations, and radar scanners. Your computers are little more than fancy calculators, your ship is armored with scrap metal, and your guns spit hot lead. The world is always dirty, usually decrepit, and often desperate. The kind of ship you might fly in Rust Hulks. First, you and your crew get to make a ship together while you make your characters. You elect a Captain, and then you get a job. Jobs vary; simple ones are just hauling cargo or ferrying passengers. More complicated ones might be escorting merchants, running hits on pirates or outlaws, or doing search-and-rescues. Real dangerous jobs will see you pulling heists, smuggling contraband, and assassinating high-profile targets. When you play, you'll be good at some things on the ship, and worse at others. As you complete jobs, you'll earn credit to repair and upgrade your ship, and you'll advance your own skills to learn new abilities and moves. Rust Hulks is a roleplaying game; you sit around a table and describe what you do. The other players and the Master of Ceremonies�what this game calls its Game Master�will do the same. Occasionally, you'll roll some dice. If the roll goes well, you describe what you get to do; if the roll goes badly, the MC will describe what happens to you; if the roll goes midway 'twixt the two, you and the MC will both figure it out, together. It's Powered by the Apocalypse, which means things that involve dice are divvied up into things called Moves. When you make a move, you roll the dice: roll two six-sided dice and add the results together; you'll often add some other modifier to that roll, too. If that total is 10 or higher, things go well; if it's a 6 or lower, things go poorly; if it's a 7, 8, or 9, things end up with a bit of both. That's the entire dice system in a nutshell: everything else is variations on that theme. At its barest bones, Rust Hulks is a game about telling stories, together, out in the hulks. Anything that doesn't add to that in some way has been stripped out. You also get to draw your ship together, and then change it as time goes on! There are lots of roleplaying games about flying around in spaceships. There are even a few games that are also Powered by the Apocalypse that are about flying around in spaceships. Rust Hulks is different, first and foremost, because the scale is much smaller. The game is entirely set in our own solar system, and there aren't any aliens or magic; you don't explore new worlds as much as you skim across the existing ones. Your goal is not to save the galaxy, it's to stay afloat. If anything, the only thing you're saving is the crew�and even that isn't salvation from some alien warlord, it's escape from running out of fuel halfway to Neptune. The scope is smaller, more detailed, more intimate. Rust Hulks is also different because it's a little more intricate, a little more tangled. Your relationships with the other crew members change in more ways than one; you've got relationships with the ship and the individual rooms that make it up; there's a Captain that's somehow supposed to oversee everything as it's happening. Things will get messy between you, the others, and the ship�and quickly. The game is not really about the goal you all set out to achieve; it is on some level, sure, but it's really about how all of you change along the way. Nine different playbooks, with special moves, gear, and options for each: Plus a playbook for the ship, with all of its moves. You can see a sample character playbook and the ship playbook below: Click this image�it links to a PDF! Rules, guidelines, and suggestions for all of the above, plus detailed explanations, examples, and possible ways to twist them around. Some intermediate rules, for governing things like relationships, resources, legality, that sort of thing. Moves, guidelines, and advice for running the game as MC; what you can and can't do, what you should and shouldn't be doing. A list of jobs, rules and moves for each, and how they affect the broader game as a whole. Some brief high-level worldbuilding and history, indices of descriptions for locations and objects, and a quick overview of what you might find on each planet and moon in the solar system. Suggestions, advice, and guidelines for hacking the rules of the game past what's already here, including possible options and modifications for stuff like mechs and landcrawlers. The book itself will probably be about 200 pages, give or take. The book will be printed in a small format (about 6"" x 9""), in black and white with a color cover, with some basic art done mostly by me. As stretch goals are reached, the page count will likely increase. (On a related subject, if you're a publisher of tabletop RPGs and this seems like the sort of thing you'd be interested in picking up, I would love to talk to you�contact info's below!) The PDF is just that, a PDF of the game. The hardcover book is, likewise, a hardcover copy of the game. The hardcovers will be printed through DriveThruRPG; PDFs will be distributed via DriveThruRPG and itch.io, as well as potentially others in the future. I've worked with DriveThruRPG before, and as a student, my printing resources are otherwise limited. The Playtest Kits are a bit more involved. A couple times over the course of this year, in August and then again in December or January, I will release playtest versions of the game, which you will get to play. You'll also get access to a Discord server I've set up, where you can give me feedback on the game and I'll do my best to answer questions. (This is also the tier where, if we make it to stretch goals that include digital content, you will receive that digital content for free.) The crew patch is a 2""-3"" embroidered iron-on patch, which will feature the image of a derelict spaceship, much like one you might fly in Rust Hulks. It's suitable to put on a jacket, backpack, or wherever else you can iron on such things normally. The dog-tag is a military-style metal dog-tag, which you can customize the text of, about five lines' worth. Once you've chosen your custom message, I will then use chemical shenanigans and my own two hands to artificially rust the tag, so when it comes to you it will already have seen a decade's worth of space-trucking. The oneshot session is a single session of Rust Hulks run by me, Sam. You can pick a handful of friends and we'll get together online (or in person, if you're in the Boston or Rochester areas) and play a session sometime before the game's release. It'll likely run about 3-4 hours, enough for an evening's game. The etched steel brick is exactly what it sounds like. It's a big block of steel etched with a message of your choice, and then once again artificially rusted by me. It makes a fantastic paperweight, building material, or murder weapon. A potential mockup of what the rusty dog tag might look like. A chunk of it is going towards printing costs and getting the orders in for the various rewards. It's also going towards software, like InDesign and Photoshop; towards artists for a few pieces of artwork I'm not confident I can do myself (like the cover); and towards other expenses, such as travel to playtest sessions or materials needed for testing. Mostly, though, it's going towards my rent, so I can work on this instead of having to hunt down some other job. The main goal for the campaign is $5,000, which will get everything listed above. At $7,500, I will have the funding to be able to hire a better artist than me, and so the book will have several much-nicer pieces of artwork throughout, plus fancier cover artwork. At $10,000, a tenth playbook will be added to the game, tentatively called the Machine. It's a robot or other mechanical entity, one with unique abilities governed by highly specific laws. At $12,500, I will have the funding for even more better art. This will include a separate piece for each of the ten (or eleven?) playbooks, some rad diagrams of ships, and more art throughout the book as a whole. At $15,000, an eleventh playbook will be added to the game, likely called the Stranger. It's a weirdo, someone with oddball powers; a psychic, a cyborg, or something far more alien. If the campaign goes beyond $15,000, there will be more stretch goals added. This might be short hacks, more in-depth worldbuilding, or something else entirely. Who knows? Hello! I'm Sam. I'm a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where I'm going into my senior year of studying game design, with a focus on roleplaying games. Currently, I'm back on my home turf in the Boston area of Massachusetts, but I'll be back in Rochester come fall. Over the past few years, I've developed some other RPGs and RPG-ish stuff with some success, which you can see on my portfolio. I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign just a few months ago for my cyberpunk zine as a part of ZineQuest (the PDFs of which just shipped, and the zines themselves will ship over the summer). I also run an experimental homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign on Twitch; it's on hold for the summer months, but we'll be back in the fall (if you're curious, check out our VoDs). Outside of RPGs, I'm into theater, music, and running giant games of moderated tag. If you've got questions, comments, or just want to talk, feel free to hit me up on Twitter, @HeadOfTheGoat. Thanks!"

Your goal is to guide them safely back to their barn without accidentally stepping on a land mine. There's one problem...your path is unclear and you must move onto a tile to reveal what is beneath. Is it a barn? Is it a Safe Field tile? Is it a landmine? There's only one way to find out. 4-Player Game Setup In the quest to help the herd find their barn, you must take two actions which will move your sheep throughout the field. In addition, you can use cards dealt to you that have unique abilities such as moving your sheep, stealing another player's sheep and even saving your own sheep. Gain points along the way for discovering safe tiles, diffusing landmines and finding barns. You will also score points at the end of the game for having sheep in your Barn and Barnyard. The player with the highest score wins the game! Artwork / Images not yet finalized This game is colorblind friendly. The tiles, cards and player boards currently have icons to identify the player color. The colored sheep will have a symbol printed on them in the final production run of the game. How To Play Sheep-Boom-Bah: (see video below) Sheep-Boom-Bah takes place over a series of turns. Gameplay moves in clockwise order. On your turn, you must take two (2) actions. In addition, you also have the option to play or discard any number of cards from your hand. Actions and card play can occur in any order. If you play or discard cards, draw back up to four to end your turn. The two types of Actions include: 1.) Move a sheep to a field tile. Flip over that tile and resolve its effect. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 In the video above for example, revealing the safe field tile will score that player 1 point. Once a tile is revealed, moving your sheep onto that specific tile again will no longer score points. The image below shows the tiles hidden within the field and how to resolve their effects. 2.) Move a sheep from the barn to the barnyard on your player board. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Cardplay Below are the types of cards that are available in the game Blue background cards are shown above. There are also red, green and yellow variants of each card. The icons on the cards are used to identify each player color. A player can choose whether or not to play cards on their turn. If cards are played, the used cards are placed into a discard pile next to the draw pile. Some important aspects of card play to keep in mind: Players can have a maximum of four cards in their hand during the game. There is no limit to the number of cards you can play on your turn. Players can play certain cards out of turn. Once played you may draw back to four cards. On a players turn, if cards are played or discarded, draw back up to four cards at the end of your turn. END GAME AND SCORING Once a player has removed all of their sheep from the field, the remaining players take one more turn. Then the game is over. Note: If a player�s last sheep is bumped into a barn, out of turn, that player would still have one more turn before the end of the game. The player with the highest score wins the game! In case of a tie, the player with the most sheep in their barn wins.

During this time we had a chance to take the game to various conventions to play-test and demo. Over this time, we've gotten some great feedback and suggestions that went into making this a truly exciting game. We were even fortunate enough to win ""Tabletop Game of the Year"" at Gameacon 2018. Here are some of the events that we attended: Too Many Games - Oaks, PA - 2018 Save Against Fear - Harrisburg, PA - 2018 Gamestar (at Steel Stacks) - Bethlehem, PA - 2018 Gameacon - Atlantic City, NJ - 2018 South Jersey Geekfest - Woodbury Heights, NJ - 2018 PAX Unplugged - Philadelphia, PA - 2018 Shipping for Sheep-Boom-Bah will be collected after the campaign ends. The main purpose for this is we do not want to over charge our backers for shipping. For our international backers, it gives us the chance to assess how many copies will be going to each country. If the amount is enough, we will be able to ship within the region to avoid any VAT charges and make the shipment ""friendly"". By doing this, it will also reduce the estimated shipping charges shown below. These are the current estimates for shipping for each pledge level: Shipping (1x copy of Sheep-Boom-Bah & Hero of the Herd) USA: $5 Canada: $15 EU:$20 Rest of the World: $30 Shipping (One Day West Games Collection - 1x Monster Highway, 1x Sheep-Boom-Bah) USA: $10 Canada: $30 EU:$40 Rest of the World:$60 Shipping (Retailers: 6x Copy of Sheep-Boom-Bah + demo copy) Only available for USA based brick and mortar stores within a 25 mile radius to 19426 will receive free delivery. Outside this 25 mile range, please contact us for a shipping quote *** This pledge level is only available for verified retail stores in the USA. *** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you are interested in more then one copy of the game, please contact us here for a shipping quote and include the number of copies requested and country that the order will be shipped to. We will hand deliver the games to friends and family backers. Local pickup will be available. We are a board game design & publishing company run by brothers, Bob & Ryan Craig. We aim to deliver high quality, family friendly games that blend strategy and a dash of chance. Last year we were fortunate enough to have our first game, Monster Highway, funded on Kickstarter. In this game, players are trying to escape a nuclear meltdown and a radioactive monster by building roads and driving their car to their home base. The game was manufactured and delivered to our backers on time. We have been happy to receive pictures and emails of the game in play with friends and family. It has even won several awards including: Gameacon's Crystal Award for ""Tabletop Game of the Year"" and the Inquisitive Meeple's ""Hidden Gem"" award. We are excited to have our second game, Sheep-Boom-Bah, on Kickstarter now. We have taken everything we learned from Monster Highway and applied it to Sheep-Boom-Bah. You can expect the same high quality in the game components, easy to learn rules and quick game play. The addition of unique game mechanics has made Sheep-Boom-Bah a game that has exceeded our expectations. There are a lot more exciting games scheduled to be released in the near future!

Our software toolchain uses a recent browser technology called WebUSB to program the FPGA, without any software required other than a modern web browser (Chrome/Opera/Edge75 supported for now). We also provide a browser-less, command-line solution. We plan to open-source all of our hardware designs. View our cloud IDE here: https://beta.webfpga.io. We're fully compatible with IceStorm/iCECube in offline workflows!

Cloud Development Environment -- Works on All Operating Systems FPGA Device; 32 GPIOS and 5,280 Logic Cells From the second you receive our board, you will be able to plug it in, synthesize Verilog, and flash it. NO SOFTWARE REQUIRED! Stretch Goal! If we exceed $24,000 in funding, all FPGA Kits will be upgraded! Each kit will receive an additional RGB Neopixel LED Strip and Seven-Segment Display. That's right, each kit will come with two of each! � in addition to the other three companion boards, of course. These modules are chainable, so you can effectively have an 8-digit seven-segment display or a 16-long individually addressable RGB LED strip. If you have already backed WebFPGA, don't feel obligated to increase your pledge. We appreciate every existing contribution. This is just a little extra kick for those interested. Also, consider upgrading from a standalone device to a kit. We have been hard at work polishing our Verilog standard library, which works out of the box for each companion board. Here is a close-up of the chainable IO pins. The inputs are on the left-hand side and additional modules are chained on the right-hand side. ""DI"" denotes ""Data Input"" and ""DO"" denotes ""Data Output"". (Note, these two modules are not intermixable. Neopixel strips can only be extended with Neopixels strips, and Seven-segment Displays can only be extended with Seven-Segment Displays.) Neopixel RGB LED Strip with Circled Chainable IO Pins Seven-Segment Display with Circled Chainable IO Pins Who are we? This endeavor was conceived and developed by: Mick Jacobs - Hardware Lead (previously an ASIC Manager at Cisco Systems) Ryan Jacobs - Software Lead (student at UCLA, Computer Science & Engineering) What�s an FPGA? (If you�re already familiar with FPGAs and their use cases, you should skip this section.) FPGA is an acronym for �Field Programmable Gate Array�. In essence, the �field programmable� isn�t too relevant other than implying that the whole �gate array� is programmable. The �gate array� is the cool part. Think of the whole chip as an array of logical gates (e.g. AND/OR/etc). These logic gates can be wired up however you may desire. For example, you might decide to write some logic that tints an entire image red. On a CPU, each pixel would need to be tinted one by one. But in digital logic, each pixel can be tinted simultaneously. Microcontollers, CPUs, GPUs, etc. consist of logical gates solidified into an integrated circuit at a silicon foundry. However, with FPGAs, these gates can be reprogrammed on the fly. FPGAs are used to develop specialized, dynamic digital logic systems. If you would like to learn a little bit more about Verilog and FPGAs, checkout this brief introduction we've made: https://youtu.be/VjklURLUXHo. It's aimed at people coming from a software rather than hardware background. We also plan to write a series of easy-to-read blog posts to make learning digital logic as approachable as learning traditional software programming. Read the first one here! https://blog.webfpga.io/2019/03/02/sr-latches/ Motivation Until recently, FPGA development has suffered from a high barrier to entry for newcomers. In the past, development boards using Xilinx, Lattice, and Altera chipsets easily fetched $250-$2000 price tags. The hardware barrier has been all but eliminated by recent entrants, which include MojoBoard (https://alchitry.com/products/mojo-v3), the IceBreaker (https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga), and TinyFPGA (https://tinyfpga.com/) who offer sub-$100 kits. However, despite the hardware barrier being dramatically lowered, the required software to develop on these systems is still �hefty�. The Xilinx and Lattice environments easily exceed 30 GB installs. Additionally, due to its nature, synthesis (place & route) is a computationally intense task. Lightweight student laptops (such as Macbook Airs or Chromebooks) cannot adequately supply the necessary raw processing power. Not only this, but most toolchains do not support all operating systems equally. With WebFPGA, educators could teach a classroom of high-school students with nothing more than a Chromebook per kid. In fact, some modern smartphones support WebUSB too! We aim to completely revamp the digital logic development experience. Our cloud-based toolchain performs synthesis on our backend, forwarding the logs and final bitstream to the client for flashing. Local CPU expenditure is zero. WebFPGA is a remote wrapper around these powerful and complex toolchains. Simply feed it your hardware description in Verilog source files and about a minute later it will return a synthesised bitstream, ready for flashing! (VHDL will be supported in the future). Software Backend Our backend is comprised of a network of self-hosted Kubernetes orchestrations. Our nodes are a mix a of self-hosted and remote bare-metal machines. We are selling our hardware to fund the backend. So, all backers will receive a full, lifetime membership to our software. Read our FAQ for more information on our business model, compatible toolchains, and support plan. For our launch, we allow any anonymous user to synthesize Verilog on our website. However, in the future, we will require users to create an account to synthesize code. This protects us and ensures that paying customers will have always have adequate resources. Command-line Support A certain subset of developer culture avoids GUI IDEs like the devil� which is why we provide a separate CLI toolchain. The CLI toolchain integrates flawlessly into the *nix-style workflow (Git, Make, and friends). In the near future, we will have an official release for the toolchain. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Roadmap Our software is currently in a beta state. We will remain in beta for one month after our funding ends. Our boards are fully functional with the beta site, however there are some user features that we still plan on developing. For participating in our beta, you will be rewarded with a full membership to our platform. Our beta roadmap includes: A pristine standard library, including modules for the on-board RGB LED, button debouncing, standard SPI/I2C interfaces, etc. User accounts and file saving A Verilog module community (think NPM, but for Verilog) that allows users to seamlessly share and integrate code Online simulation and waveform viewing Vendor Lock-in Don�t get us wrong, as a software student and a member of the industry, we understand the fear of vendor lock-in. That is not our goal. Please note that our boards are fully functional without our software � the Lattice IDE is free to download and can work independently of our toolchain. (The open-source toolchain IceStorm is also compatible with our chipset.) If we ever decide to end official support, we will open-source our entire backend. All backers of our campaign will receive a lifetime membership to our cloud-based toolchain at no additional cost. Additionally, all components of our hardware stack are user-programmable. We encourage power-users to reprogram our on-board microcontroller and discover interesting use cases.

Web Buttons As you might have noticed on our cloud IDE, there are four buttons on the left toolbar labeled ""BTN1"", ""BTN2"", etc. These buttons are referred to as input wires ""WF_CPU1"", ""WF_CPU2"", etc. because they actually stem from the on-board microcontroller. These are a godsend for debugging. You can simply include them into your top-level module and when you click on the in the IDE, they will respond accordingly. This example simply uses BTN1 to toggle the state of the on-board LED. Example of using a web button to control the state of the on-board LED. Companion Boards In addition to our standalone board, we are selling a kit that comes with 5 compatible companion boards. All of these boards have working example code on our website.

The Strapping Lads Tarak the Tiger (half-orc barbarian) Rhovan (dragonborn bard) Djoser (human cleric) Farid (fire genasi druid) Ehecatl (human fighter) Durgan (dwarf monk) Cedric (aasimar paladin) Khunoth (goliath ranger) Zerrakas (tiefling rogue) Regulus (human sorcerer) Conalt (half-elf warlock) Antorvir (drow wizard) Zerrakas (tiefling rogue), Ehecatl (human fighter), and Antorvir (drow wizard) What it is The Strapping Lads book is a full-color 28-page supplement for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It features twelve male characters, one of each class from the 5e Player�s Handbook. Each character�s spread contains a saucy pin-up, a condensed statblock, and an interview profile. More than simply eye candy, the Strapping Lads are characters you can include in your own game as either a player or a DM! Sample character spread - Final product may look different All physical products will be shipped using USPS Flat-Rate Priority Mail. Shipping cost is the same no matter what you order. Add-On Options Wooden Map Tokens You can get a full set of Lads' map tokens! These laser-engraved wood tokens are 1"" wide, perfect for using on your table maps. You'll get twelve tokens total, one of each Lad, so you can include them in your campaigns! The final art may vary from this picture Due to the processing time, this will take a bit more time to fulfill. The art shown is a preview and the final product's appearance may vary. Custom Character Dice Bags (Limited Quantity) You can get YOUR character�s face on a dice bag! These canvas bags are approximately 5.5x7.5 inches flat. They�re quite large, perfect for accommodating every gamer�s growing dice collection. We all know we can never settle on just one set. I draw the portrait digitally and use sublimation to press the ink into the cloth. Dice bags are water resistant, but should not be run in the dryer. Doing so may cause the ink to fade. Sample dice bags - Final product may look different You�ll receive: One (1) digital character headshot One (1) dice bag with your character�s headshot To save on shipping costs, your Strapping Lads book will be shipped with the dice bag. This may delay your shipment approximately 1-2 months. Custom Character Commissions (Limited Quantity) At this tier, you�ll receive a print copy of the book AND I�ll draw you a full-color, full-body picture of one D&D character with no background. This can be your character or you can do it as a gift for your friend or favorite player! This portrait can be as safe or as saucy as you would like (18+ art is acceptable). The commission itself is a digital-only reward. You will NOT receive a print along with your print Strapping Lads book. However, the final drawing will be delivered at high resolution if you wish to print it. Example commission drawing Stretch Goals Stretch goals unlocked! If we reach $1,000, I'll add an Artificer character as a digital bonus feature! At $1,250, I'll add a Mystic! And if we hit $1,500, I'll add a Gunslinger. Since I have most of the pre-Stretch copy ready, I'll include these three characters as a digital-only supplement. This way I can get you the books in the promised time frame. However! If we reach $2,000 I'll include the bonus classes in the print edition as well! About the Creator Hello! I'm Micah, a Virginia-based illustrator and cartoonist with a love of tabletop gaming, mythology, comics, and pin-up art. I�ve felt like there is a need for more saucy male art in tabletop gaming, so I created the Strapping Lads supplement to satisfy that need. If you enjoy my work, you can find more on Patreon, Twitter, deviantART, and Instagram! I also create the online comic, the Sparrow, a mythology-meets-superheroes story where all the characters are based on myth and folklore from around the world!"

The GOAL has been Reached - $25K Stretch Goal Initialized for Extension Set: HEAVY METALS THE GUEST ARTISTS We hand picked the CRUNCHIEST line-up of Street Artists and Visionary Artists from around the globe to assist in manifesting the Elements, with each artist developing and transforming their Universal building block into a visual portal that tells the story of the Element! We spent over a year developing the ""Royal Pack"", which contains 34 Element designs and scientific information pertinent to each. This information is presented in simple icon format, describing the properties of each Element. The Royal Pack is a large, Tarot Sized Card Deck (7 x 12 cm / 2.75 x 4.75""), printed on Premium Quality Paper (350gsm) with rounded edges and a Smooth Finish. But we have more Elements to include and with your assistance we can complete all 118 Element designs, pursue more amazing artists, and assign more Elements to our core Guest Artists! atommix :: Royal deck featuring ""Action Cards"" THE GAME atommix :: is a Card Game visually portraying the 118 Elements of the Periodic Table, allowing Players to experience true chemistry through visual storytelling! Our primary goal for the game is to make the Periodic Table approachable for children as well as adults, while exploring a creative way to educate ourselves and the next generation. The 42 Card Royal Pack, including 34 Elements and 6 action cards, comes neatly packaged in a hardcover ""Boom Box"", nestled alongside the Complete Rule Book, allowing Backers access to the most abundant Elements. Download (WIP) Rulebook for atommix :: Help Construct the Game Download Rulebook in Hebrew LEVEL 1 is the simplest, where the goal is to experience the Elements by Family. An Element family is a set of Elements sharing common properties. This is a useful way of looking at the Periodic Table with a fresh point of view, and it helps us remember the Elements and their families the more we play! It is a very quick game, between five to ten minutes, so it is perfect for a short coffee break, or as an activity with children. We also have fun shouting out the names of each Element we discard as we play. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 LEVEL 2 adds some spice to the game. This time we are experimenting with Energy Levels. Electrons in an atom are contained in specific Energy Levels (1-7). The larger the number of the Energy Level, the more energy and mass it contains. In the ""classic"" Periodic Table each row of the table represents an Energy Level. LEVEL 2 makes it easy to grasp the order of Elements from lightest to the heaviest, in a playful manor.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 LEVEL 3 is a whole different ballgame, well Card Game. This Level is a fun way to explore the properties of each Element, or as we like to call them ""Special Effects"". By comparing the Special Effects we can find similarities between the Elements and see the correlation between the Families (the colors). The Winner is the first to score 10 Points by matching Special Effects with another. In your turn you can either gain points or disrupt and block your Opponent from gaining points.

Sermob is a Mexico based artist using tight lifework in his murals and compositions to convey a deep message concerning the unity of all things living, and the profound connection between cause and effect. Emily Ding is a Texas based artist with tenacious ambition and relentless drive, whose devotion to the visual arts exhibits itself in artwork bearing messages related to caring for all creatures, and a focus on movement and flow which she describes as �visceral�. Dionne Ong is a Vancouver based artist with a focus on transforming strange animals into graphical line flow, and artwork that tells stories of enchanting, haunted forests, moonlight critters and other oddities. Why a Card Game? Most of us have long ago discarded the Periodic Table from memory, but in order for it to genuinely stick we have combined the Elemental properties with visual language, which is immediately interpreted by the brain. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than just plain text, so by placing powerful and beautiful images next to words our brains create an immediate connection between the two - just like in advertising - the same manipulation can be used for a better purpose! atommix :: Card Game Prototype Who is EXTRA CRUNCHY? We are a duo of street artists otherwise known as Extra Crunchy. In the past three years we have traveled around the world painting murals and spreading good vibes. Last year a unique concept dawned upon us, one that would allow us to learn more about the building blocks of our reality - the atoms from which we and everything around us are made, and this path led to the creation of atommix :: mural in Denver, Colorado, 2017 We enjoy exploring many fields, but street murals are a favorite because they are out where people can see them, the scale is fun, and it is a great way to share positive messages through art. mural of Argon in Kharagpur, India, 2019 We decided to use our mural making skills to promote atommix :: and had the pleasure of traveling to three technology institute events across India, each giving us the opportunity to paint live Element murals and share the concept of the Game. mural of Neon in Chennai, India, 2019 As creative explorers we also love finding new sources of inspiration and sharing them. This project is a great opportunity to get exposed to art that speaks a language higher than words! Use the links below to find us in a variety of locations, and to share us with others!

Sometimes unusual, sometimes beautiful, but always interesting to look at. This game plays in different levels.

I am so honored and excited to share these original prose and art with you all. I have always loved to write, and truth be told, the style of creating artwork that includes word, color, and images came about towards the end of my time in Art School in Chicago about 20 years ago. It was my way of putting my writing out there, without having to feel center stage. The words were not in clean, legible black and white print, so I could hide them in the scribble. Additionally, I loved the aesthetic of handwriting, which was so important to me with the loss of handwriting in today's world. My feeling was always: read the words, look at the words, or enjoy the words, and the pretty picture. There are no rules. This book is my opportunity to tell the truth, because that's all I've ever wanted to do. The truth is not easy, and usually scary- but as Elizabeth Gilbert's dear friend Ryya Elias always said ""The truth has legs."" It will be the last one in the room standing, so why don't we just cut to the chase, and begin there. Thank you and much Love you all. https://thejulietteletters.wordpress.com/"

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest! A link to the Pledge Manager for Late Pledges will be coming soon! If you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com. Thunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. In the spring of 2018 we Kickstarted To The Barricades!, adding solo and CoOp play and two additional Quests, which were delivered in the spring of 2019. New Horizons After the climactic battle in Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World, the Champions are dispersed by the forces of wild magic. One awakens in a far realm of endless sands. Another discovers himself in a strange new city where he may learn the fate of his people. The world of Thunderstone Quest is even larger than we could ever imagine. It's time to explore these New Horizons. Back the campaign TODAY to begin or continue your Thunderstone Quest adventure! Due to the overwhelming support of the community, the $400,000 Stretch Goal has been Achieved! We will add the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all New Horizons Rewards (and Rewards that include New Horizons)! Congratulations to everyone who helped rally the community to reach this HUGE goal! Because of Kickstarter's rules, we cannot change the description of the Rewards to note that the 4th Level Heroes have been added. (Backers who choose the ""Your Inventory is Full"" Reward will be issued a $25 credit in the Pledge Manager) This Kickstarter features two new Quests: Quest 8: Vengeful Sands and Quest 9: Clockwork Destiny, both designed by Bryan Reese with story written by Brett Satkowiak. All Quests including Vengeful Sands and Clockwork Destiny can be played in either Barricades Mode or Competitive Mode. This campaign also includes a special promo pack for Barricades Mode: Ezuzrius' Lair (estimated MSRP $9.99) included in the New Horizons Reward (and all Rewards that contain the New Horizons reward)! Ezuzrius' Lair is a Kickstarter Early Access release, meaning that Kickstarter backers will get this promotional pack before it is available for sale. At this time we do not have a planned retail release for this item. You have four options to back this Kickstarter - New Horizons which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, Champion + Barricades + New Horizons which combines all three Kickstarter Rewards into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes everything we make for Thunderstone Quest. Your Inventory is Full! (If you have a Thunderstone Quest base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and did not back To the Barricades, you will be able to add it as an Add-on in the Pledge Manager with your New Horizons pledge.) We are also offering a limited quantity of Expedited Rewards. Because of the long lead time for production of the new content in this Kickstarter we will not be able to deliver the new content until next year. But we have set aside a limited quantity of Champion and Barricades components so that we can swiftly manufacture enough units for delivery this November! New Horizons and Add-ons to Expedited orders will ship next year with the rest of the Rewards. Note for Expedited Backers: After the campaign ends, you can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Expedited components. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. If you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your shipment Expedited. This campaign also includes a special Add-on: 4th Level Heroes! The 4th Level Heroes bring more power and abilities to the game. Note to all Backers: The Champion/To the Barricades! boxes contain space to hold these two new Quests and they will be shipped without the individual boxes shown in the graphics for this campaign. If you would like to order the boxes for these Quests they'll be available for a small fee as Add-ons in the Pledge Manager. Note to Non-English Speakers: All the contents of this campaign are in English only. AEG is working with a team of international partners on future campaigns for non-English language support which we'll be announcing later in 2019. Benefits to this Campaign: You will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price ($39.99 x 2 Quests + an estimated $9.99 for Ezuzuris' Lair) You'll get the New Horizons content before the normal retail release You'll get the Ezuzrius' Lair Promo Pack You'll get the 4th Level Heroes Add-on If your order includes the Champion Reward you will receive Kickstarter Exclusive Content If your order includes the Champion Reward and/or the To the Barricades Reward you'll get the large boxes & storage system with those Rewards Qualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. Vengeful Sands Previews We are pleased to showcase some of the cards from Quest 8: Vengeful Sands here on the Kickstarter Campaign page. You can see all of these previews as blog entries at alderac.com! Scarabs (1 of 3) Click this image to download the Rulebook (26MB PDF) Click this link to download the Questbook (33MB PDF) Click here to download the Barricades Mode Rulebook & Questbook Thunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome. Each player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip. On each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both! In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian. Depending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner! The competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. You can add funds to your pledge as described in the graphic above which will be automatically credited to your account in the Pledge Manager. Or, you can wait until the Pledge Manager opens and purchase Add-ons directly, paying the balance due on your order in the Pledge Manager instead. There is no difference in price or availability. Altering your pledge on Kickstarter is convenient and it helps us grow the total amount pledged which has a positive effect for attracting more Backers. To the Barricades (not shown) You will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping & Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward. Epic Thunderstone Support for Champion: This is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion Rewards. The Champion Reward does not include an extra copy of every card for Epic Thunderstone use. Epic Thunderstone is a popular way to play invented by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different. Rules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook. You can read those rules in the Rulebook link above! The purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward. All the content in To The Barricades! and all new content for New Horizons in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included. There are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread. You'll need a base copy of Thunderstone Quest (Champion, Adventurer or Retail) to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the base game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone. 4th Level Heroes NOTE: The campaign has achieved it's $400,000 Stretch Goal and this Add-on will automatically be included in every New Horizons Reward! You do not need to pay extra to get this Stretch Goal benefit! This is a special deck of cards which adds a 4th experience level to every Hero in the game from Quests 1-9 as well as the extra Heroes released with the Champion box. There are over fifty 4th Level Heroes in this package! There will be 2 copies of each 4th level hero, one for use in normal Competitive and Barricades Mode play, and a second for use in Epic Thunderstone mode. Quest 2: Total Eclipse of the Sun This Add-on is for people who have purchased the Retail Base Set and did not back either of the previous Kickstarters. The Champion Reward contains a Quest which is Kickstarter Exclusive and is not available in retail stores as a stand-alone purchase. You can buy that Quest via this Add-on. Update: 17 June: Based on a suggestion from backer @Chris, we're upgrading this Add-on to include all the additional promo cards added to the Champion Reward during the 1st Kickstarter so that you will be able to get every card released for Thunderstone Quest in the Champion unit if you get this Add-on, the Retail Base and the retail release of Quest 4 and Quest 5! This change will add about 50 more cards to this Add-on at no additional charge! Please Note: If you have or are buying the Champion Reward, or if you bought the Adventurer Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, you already have this Quest. The Quest will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the New Horizons pledge level to order this Add-on. Neoprene Playmat This is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter! We've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern. It is substantially smaller than the board included in the main game. The Playmat is double-sided. One side is the ""day"" layout for competitive play. And the reverse is the ""night"" side with spaces for the Barricades board overlays, showing the Village partially destroyed. The ""night"" side is intentionally darker than the day side to reflect the perilous condition of the Village! The Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within either the Champion or the To The Barricades box, box, rolled up. The length is 300 mm. Premium Sleeves These are AEG Premium Sleeves, also used in Mystic Vale, Edge of Darkness, and Valley of the Kings Premium. They have an excellent reputation for durability! The Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90� (or ""microns"" = 3.54 ""mils"")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards. We are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish. To sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves). You will need 2 more packs to sleeve the all the new content in To the Barricades! including randomizers, Epic support cards, the 5th and 6th player support and other cards provided for Barricades Mode. You will need 2 packs total to sleeve all the content in New Horizons. To sleeve everything you'll need 8 packs of sleeves. You can store all 9 Quests, starting cards, Kickstarter exclusive cards, and Epic support cards, sleeved, in the Champion and To the Barricades boxes. Space is also available for the rolled up playmat and all other game components. We have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards. If you selected an Expedited reward you will receive your Champion and To The Barricades boxes in an expedited early shipment in November. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery. Next year when the rest of the Kickstarter Rewards for this campaign are delivered Expedited backers will get all the rest of their order including any Add-ons they have ordered in a 2nd shipment. If you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com. We will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. United States & Canadian Backers: As you may know the Administration is preparing to implement a 25% import tariff on goods shipped to the US from China. We have estimated the impact these tariffs will have on the importation of your Rewards and have adjusted the costs of the Rewards and the Shipping & Handling estimates accordingly. There will be no additional charge made for the tariffs if and when they are imposed. We will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA. The following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. We are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons at 33lbs/15kg. The following estimates are for both the regular and Expedited Rewards. The following chart also provides estimates for shipping Your Inventory is Full without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.

OCEANIA: $15 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. Rest of World: $50 These figures are estimates but we believe they will be very close to the final figures used in the Pledge Manager. All cost estimates are in US Dollars. We expect to use Aetherworks for fulfillment in Australia for this campaign. That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure. Unfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them. WE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Alderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. The Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion. Kick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to with the same Shipping & Handling costs as regular Backers. You have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. If you select the $66 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $195 purchase for 6 units of New Horizons in the Pledge Manager. The $66 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment. Access to Champion & Barricades Rewards: You will be able to order the Champion and Barricades Rewards as Add-ons to your Kick It Here order. However, due to the high cost of manufacturing these items we cannot offer a discount to the Kickstarter price; your price for Champion will be $120 per unit, and your price for Barricades will be $60. Due to the extremely large size of these boxes and their substantial weight they are usually shipped individually which means there's no meaningful savings on shipping for bulk orders. Access to the Neoprene Playmat, Epic Support, 4th Level Heroes, Quest 2, and AEG Premium Sleeves: All of these Add-ons will be available for purchase via the Kick It Here program with a small discount from the Add-on prices as listed.

This game is different from most card games in that it's designed to be played at bars, clubs, house parties, bachelor and bachelorette parties, underground bare-knuckle boxing matches... anywhere you're bold enough to play. It revolutionizes the experience of being out drinking with friends, and most people who play it say it's literally the most fun they've ever had going out. Chickenshit has extreme replayability because the environment, as well as the people involved, are always changing. You don't even have to drink to play, we just prefer to drink while playing, well... any game. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Players take turns drawing cards and completing the challenges on them within the time limit for points. Cards can range from anything like, ""Get a stranger to twerk,"" to ""Propose to someone and get them to say yes."" You can only ask people you don't know, and each player can only go up to the same person once. Each card is worth a different amount of points based on how hard the challenge is to complete. If you complete a challenge, you get to keep the card, and the player with the most points after the last card has been drawn wins! Try out different game modes like Blitzkrieg where you rush against your friends to get as many challenges done as possible, or Legendary Mode where you have to keep the fact that you're playing a secret. You and your friends can even just take turns drawing challenge cards at your own pace, or root bystanders on to draw a card and try to complete a challenge themselves. We realized that many people find going out to sit at a bar, club or lounge a rather boring experience, and even those that do enjoy going out are often looking for new ways to have fun and be social. We also noticed that there really aren't that many great drinking games that can be played out in places where people intentionally go to drink and socialize, which seemed ridiculous. The Chickenshit game cards are pretty tame and lighthearted in nature. They're designed for everyone (even your grandma) to enjoy. Initially, we created the game just for ourselves and our friends in order to make going out way more fun, but every night, tons of people we'd encounter while playing would come back up to us and ask if they could join our game. And thus, Chickenshit was born."

It will be rich with history at every turn. The pub will feature all of the classic characteristics of a traditional Irish pub. Dark woods, rich leathers, and staff dressed in the traditional Irish garb of yesteryear. There is no detail we aren't covering. We spent several years developing our food & drink menu with the healthy irishman in mind. Our menu will be different. Cheese's imported from Ireland. Craft cocktails. We are even working with an irish specialty company (in business since the 1800's) just to make sure we have real-deal authentic products.

Together with the kids and their parents we've built a strong musical family, which we've celebrated at an annual recital each June. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to take a big next step toward growing and strengthening this community. This September I will be opening Echo City Music Lab in Clinton Hill, a music school and performance space designed to serve these talented young musicians. Here are a few of the things I am excited to offer that were not possible as a roving music instructor: Group Lessons Many educators now consider group lesson formats to be the ideal way for beginner musicians to develop their skills. Here are a few of the benefits of group lessons that are difficult to recreate in a private lesson setting: Students learn not only from their teacher, but from their peers as well. Healthy competition and the desire to keep up with peers motivates practice. Playing together in an ensemble helps students develop critical listening and rhythmic skills. Students gain experience performing in front of their classmates which translates to confidence in larger performances. Group activities and games sustain attention and create a fun environment in which to learn musical concepts. Providing group lessons will make it feasible for me to offer scholarships to students who need them. Gig Nights Individuals who go on to become skilled public speakers and performance artists are often the ones who got their start performing in their community at a young age. With monthly ""Gig Nights,"" students can hone their confidence in a safe and supportive space. These shows will be headlined by local musicians and bands to help inspire this new generation of creators and performers. Workshops and Summer Intensives This space opens up endless possibilities for workshops taught by guest musicians on a broad range of topics from technology to vocal technique to music history. Echo City will eventually host a recording studio to give students hands-on experience with the magic of record making. The money you help raise will be used for: 6 digital pianos and 3 iPads for the group lesson program An upright piano for private lessons Microphones and a PA system for performances Headphones, music stands and chairs A few small construction projects We have some incredible rewards, many generously donated by friends of Echo City: Pledge $10 or more Thank you so much for helping make Echo City a reality!

As winter faded and their love bloomed, the folk-pop of Complimentary Colors was born. Complimentary Colors dances through a rainbow of emotions with childlike joy as they play small, often unusual instruments behind their lush harmonies. Touted as ""the lovechild of Amanda Palmer, Stevie Nicks, and Brandi Carlile"", hear them explore their alt-folk and country roots together, adding touches of the theatrical, while they steal your heart with their catchy, heartfelt tunes and the love that they share. Here we are, almost 2 full years after we formed this band, and we had a crazy idea. Since we know SO MANY talented people, we would just pull them together, rehearse a couple of times, and record a live album with a much bigger sound than our traditional acoustic duo. The result is a celebration of sound and friendship, a project that became a supernova outside of anything we ever dreamed of. We even got our dear friend Simran Narmis (SlowCamera Paparazzi) to paint us live! Featuring Morgan Laubach and Daniel Joseph of Ghost Town Cinema, Elle Archer of Shaylee, Hannah DiMo, Damian Hayes, Kyle Neidig, and Laura May Sowards, this recording is one of a kind, a snapshot of a moment suspended forever... And we need your help to bring it to life! We're in the process of mixing the album now with its release slated for July 21. Your donations will help pay the talented folks mixing the album, editing videos (shoutout to Caitlin Indermaur for the Kickstarter video!), and handling other production tasks. Following our epic backyard release party, we'll be hitting the road for the first leg of tour to Montana and back, followed by shows in Seattle and a couple of other Oregon towns. Then we'll catch our breath until September when we head to California (San Francisco, Sacramento, Chico, and more TBA) and southern Oregon. If we exceed our goal, we'll start planning to extend our tour reach even farther... but one thing at a time. As part of funding our tour, a big chunk (about $1000) of funds raised will be going toward outfitting us with a PA, a recording interface, and some new instrument cables. If we exceed our goal, we will be purchasing microphones, stands, and other essentials to make our array of tiny instruments sound the best that they can. Ultimately, with all of this gear we intend to start a podcast, begin producing our own music as we travel, and spread the love as far and wide as we possibly can. We've created some really fun rewards. That said, if there is something you'd absolutely love as a reward that you don't see listed, talk to us! We may be willing to discuss!

Things just ain�t what they used to be. In the world of basketball, you got kids doing stupid dribbling tricks (read: traveling) for the �Gram, high schoolers more interested in their HUDL highlight reels than winning conference championships, and media outlets like ESPN celebrating alley-oop dunks while flawless defensive closeouts go unreported. This assault on the fundamental way of life has moved beyond the actual basketball court and into our daily lives. There is no greater example of this disastrous mission creep than in the world of water bottles. You don�t even have to leave Kickstarter to find a hundred projects claiming to have invented the �water bottle of the future.� But that�s an oxymoron. The water bottle was fine the way it was. Why isn't anyone focused on doing a few things great instead of a million things okay? Let�s face facts: there�s no $60+ price tag, no amount of Bluetooth connectivity, no new age way of folding up a water bottle� that will ever be a substitute for courage. If you think possession of the latest and greatest water bottle is the one thing missing from your life � the thing that will finally solve all your problems � snap out of it, son. THE SOLUTION The only way evil endures is if good men stand around and do nothing. And we�re not problem people � we�re solutions people. So we got to work reinventing the water bottle� back to the way it used to be. We hit the lab, cut down dozens of trees in our wanton use of sketch paper, and tinkered away into the wee hours of the morning attempting to configure a water bottle that consisted only of the elemental features that made it great� and none of those excessive features used to cloak cowardice and separate Americans from their hard-earned money. The result: The Men�s League Water Bottle, the greatest water vessel ever invented. By eliminating the superfluous features of most modern water bottles, and focusing on essentialism, we were able to create what we believe is the perfect water bottle. Every feature in our bottle is of our highest standards: An easy-flow push cap that eliminates unwanted water leakage A grooved grip made in the image of a basketball net An additional level of high-grade adhesive tape meant to block out freezing temperature transfer (that can survive dozens of wash cycles without issue!) The Goldilocks of water containment- 24 ounces - not too much, not too little. If simplicity is the height of sophistication, then our deconstructed, fundamental water bottle has a PhD from Harvard, an annual subscription to the New Yorker, and a love for fine Bordeaux wines. Except � that�s how losers define sophistication. In our world, sophistication equals flawless bounce passes, proper lane fills, and box outs that are so sublime the ball hits the ground and eventually rolls to a stop. If you�re the kind of guy that understands you shouldn�t get credit for simply doing your damn job, then finally, you�ve found a bottle that matches your disposition. This is a water bottle for the man you ought to be, a water bottle for the self-actualized you that no longer needs an alarm because you wake up at 4:30 on your own, fired up about life and another opportunity to get better. This is a water bottle for the men who know the glory is the grind. WHO WE ARE This all started with an ordinary man, called into extraordinary circumstances, by the dissolution of fundamental basketball. As the world crumbled around him, one average Men�s League veteran realized that somewhere along the way, we�d let the Look-at-Me Ballers of the world take over every gym in America. Threes were being heaved with reckless abandon. Neon shoes were everywhere. Youngsters were more concerned with Nutmegging their defender for �the �Gram,� than sliding in on help-side defense for a crucial charge. With no one else willing to take a stand, this Men�s League Guy took to the streets, preaching the Good News of the Fundamental Gospel. A movement was born. His ministry struck a nerve, and what started as a Twitter account meant to vent frustrations, soon became something much bigger. Men�s League Guy, the Commissioner of Men�s League and in turn this movement, knew his aims had to be higher. So he set out to create the greatest gym water bottle ever invented. The Commissioner has begun building out a team of highly competent individuals to help him make this water bottle a reality. These team members are experts in their field, and 100% committed to spreading the Fundamental Gospel from sea to shining sea. Mastering the water bottle is our first project as a team. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP Project Water Bottle (the codename for this project) began in earnest in March 2019. We spent the last three months working with our manufacturing partners to finalize a working prototype. This is the bottle you see in our video and photos, a water bottle we're proud to say meets our standards and vision. But it's still a prototype. That's why we've launched this Kickstarter, because there's still work to be done. Perfectly manufactured water bottles are not just conjured out of thin air, folks. There�s a lot of research and development that goes into this, and we�re at a crossroads as a company right now. We need $261 to create that final strip of runway to get our water bottle to the mass market. Specifically, your financial investment will allow us to: Make final development adjustments to our water bottle There's currently a chasm between our prototype design cost and our planned cost-per-unit production model. We need your financial help to finalize the design of our bottle without sacrificing any of the quality that makes our prototype best-in-class. That entails... Securing the necessary inventory to sell our product to the masses on August 1 There's obvious cost savings when producing mass quantities. This Kickstarter will allow us to precisely place our first inventory order, giving us the confidence through early bird orders to manufacture, package, and deliver our first run in an efficient manner. Paying designers to help us develop industry-leading brand packaging This is our first product, and we want do this right. We're not just sending water bottles in empty boxes. We need to pay graphic designers to help us create a brand identity in our packaging of each water bottle. This also involves working with a packaging manufacturer to mass produce packaging for our influx of inventory. We need your capital to help ensure we produce our packaging at a competitive, cost-effective price. Build out the e-commerce infrastructure on our website to turn our company from a content site to a fully-functional shopping platform Right now the Men's League website is content-based, but for it to become the exclusive home of Men's League water bottles, we need to revamp our site to make it an e-commerce platform. This involves time, energy, and capital to make sure we do it the right way. Acquire the marketing budget to spread the Good News of our water bottle far and wide Simply producing the world's best minimalist workout water bottle means nothing if no one knows it exists. That's why we plan to use a portion of our Kickstarter raise to fund social media marketing around the water bottle's launch on August 1. This is vital to ensuring a positive rollout and setting our Men's League water bottle up to not just be a fad, but an enduring competitor in this space. STRETCH GOALS Look, the $261 fundraising goal is our bare minimum, keep-the-lights on goal. In basketball parlance, it�s the equivalent of being up on the scoreboard at the end of the game. Sure, winning is the goal, but the true goal goes well beyond that. There�s a way to be a loser in victory. If this project hits its goal, we still need your support. Don�t take that as a sign that help is no longer needed. Winning is the bare minimum. What we�re aiming to do is ignite a spark-plug that sends the Men�s League Water Bottle atmospheric. We don�t want to put exact numbers on our stretch goals, because we find that often humans constrain themselves to the limits that are placed on them. But we will say four and five figures are just the beginning of our vision. Right now, we are only planning to produce the water bottle in white and black. But if we exceed our goal, we will immediately dive in to development on the following: Production of the water bottle in at least (3) more body SKUs: black, navy, red Production of the easy-flow push cap in at least (3) more SKUs: white, navy, red Design of a ""Floor General"" version, which will sell for $14.99, but offer a higher tier of material quality than our original model Production of two new sizing options LET'S GET TO WORK Look, sometime in the last ten years, the water bottle industry went mad. Everyone tried to out-innovate one another, and they took their eyes of the ball: you need a competitively priced water bottle - with all of the essentials - that will outlast your knees, whenever they shall fail. And damn it if we're not gonna give it to you. The Men's League Water Bottle was designed with the essentials in mind. We poured our hearts and souls into perfecting the parts of a water bottle others overlooked in their push to add bluetooth technology to beverage vessels. We're almost to the finish line, ready to deliver this product to the masses. Take a stand, join our league, and help us tell the world that the coolest thing on this planet is a product that doesn't seek glorification for simply doing its damn job."

Our goal is to educate the community on the crucial need to save these plants and give them an oasis in the middle of North Carolina. Whether it's a family day out or an opportunity to learn something new, Purple Cactus has something for everyone. With everything put aside, our main goal is providing citizens with education on the many awesome plants and encourage them to pass the amazing gifts of nature down generations in their family. There isn't very many places in the northwest NC for teens and children to go, especially with the increase in franchises popping up everywhere, we would like to give everyone a safe and enjoyable place to make memories. The Purple Cactus Plan Our plan is to build a large glass palm house much like the one at Kew Gardens for our tropical varieties. We hope to include a cactus conservatory for our desert plant friends as well. We want citizens to feel like they are in different parts of the world no matter what the weather or season is in NC. It gives the community a sense of a tropical paradise to ""get away"" for a day. The Purple Cactus also has a small petting zoo farm. Animals include: Goats, pigs, chickens,(of course dogs) and other small friendly animals. There is a farm hand always on duty to ensure the animals are safe and healthy. The admission fee will cover the cost of the feed children can give to the animals. We have many different varieties of plants and flowers in our outdoor gardens harboring many walking paths. Many of our flowers such as tulips, dahlias, etc. are available to be picked and purchased in our floral fields. We also host a cafe and coffee shop at the farm. Guest can enjoy snacks such as hot dogs and burgers, to our many gourmet vegan items The cafe would be accessible to those whom do not wish to visit the farm(which means no admission fee), but would like to dine with us for the day!"

Following the release of Cold Mountain Child's previous album in 2015, I've had the good fortune of collaborating with three gifted brothers - Shane, John, and Milowe - for Bramble's realization. They've each added their own flavors and textures to the songs. Drawing inspiration from human struggles, from my travels, power structures and wild nature, these songs are ready to be heard. Who am I? I'm Tyler, a songwriter who lives out in the country near the woods with my genius wife Marisol and our two goofy cats. Born in California, I grew up mostly in Michigan and love its natural splendor and human hearts. Alongside gardening and homestead projects, I've put together a studio in a room in our house where the tracking, mixing and mastering for Bramble happened. These last many months have been filled with recording, mixing, balancing, revising and then doing it again! Now the album is ready for physical fabrication and distribution. I'd be honored if you would join me in supporting this Kickstarter to release ""Bramble""! This campaign is a bit unique in that the sound-production work of the album is finished, so studio costs are not part of the equation. Your support will make possible: -the fabrication of CD's and cassettes. -creation of new merch to support the release. -the distribution of songs to online music services and radio stations. -shipping and Kickstarter fees. As a thank you for your help with this Kickstarter campaign you'll be getting the new album ""Bramble"" featuring the artwork of Mary ""Marby"" Vallee. Plus other treats for your kind-heartedness. Song seeds were planted, sprouted, nourished and refined. I'd be so grateful for your help in sharing the fruits. Thank you so much! -Tyler Cold Mountain Child videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcbA4cIbCxc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wniRFDowuo"

After a very successful campaign last year to make my Fox In Four Seasons enamel pin set I decided to make a new set of pins featuring some of my fan favorite Dianaland Characters. These four pins will be designed by me and manufactured by Pincats.com They will all be 1"" hard enamel pins. First up is a redesign of my super popular Doughnut Sloth pin. The first run quickly sold out and since he is my personal mascot there is not a doubt that I totally need Doughnut Sloth 2.0! Second is a Dianaland Snail. If you know me at all you know that I adore snails and can wax poetic for a long time about how well they have adapted to city living. In Dianaland they have adapted so well that they carry the built world on their backs. I will be creating a pin featuring my fave Dianaland Snail; the Lighthouse. The third pin is one of my Bear Bear Hugs. Everyone needs a little comfort once and a while, even big ol' bears. This sweet pin reminds us that hugs are for everyone. Last but not least is a Punk Rock Squirrel. This rock star loves to show his rebellion with a blue hairdo and a sassy attitude. BACKER REWARD PAINTINGS The Winter of My Discontent Punk Rock Polar Bear Unicorn Llama Bear Bear Hug Oil Painting Doughnut Sloth Oil Painting How will my funds be spent? $800 - Making the pins. I will be using Pincats.com for the manufacturing of my pins $150 - Kickstarter fees $250 - Shipping fees and packing materials. Stretch goal - If I hit $1500 I will also be making a set of new stickers featuring some of my Dianaland characters. All backers will get a full set of any stickers that I make.

It's called DRYCERATOP! DRYCERATOP in Action The mason jar is a great tool for making, preserving and experimenting with food now you can use it to dehydrate foods using 100% solar energy. DRYCERATOP x5 The DRYCERATOP is an amazing set of capabilities in an incredibly small, beautiful package. Conventional food dehydrators are huge, clunky, consume energy and cost a lot. DRYCERATOP is TINY and folds away into a drawer when not in use. It will never cost anything to operate for years of service! SUSTAINABLE DRYCERATOP uses 100% solar energy and can be brought anywhere! There are no batteries or circuitry - when the sun shines it just works. It's perfect for cooks, chefs, gardeners, foragers, hobbyists, outdoors people, scientists, prepers or herbalists. It works outside. Perfect for having fun in the patio, in the garden, on the live aboard boat, or for your #vanlife. DRYCERATOP DRYCERATOP is made of wood! Wood is beautiful and renewable especially aspen a highly sustainable species. We make DRYCERATOP in Minneapolis and we don't want to cut large amounts of plastics in our shop. Kitchen products of wood fit our aesthetic. Increasingly people are returning to wooden spoons, spatulas rolling pins and we are into that! WHAT TO MAKE DRYCERATOP can dry almost anything. Many things like herbs, hops, potpourri, flowers, and mushrooms can simply be put into the jar and maintain their own airspace. Fruits like bananas, apples, apricots or vegetables like squash, peppers and tomatoes can skewered to maintain airspace. You may want to slice certain foods to increase the drying area. The same food and preparation goes for any dehydrator so you can use times and techniques found anywhere online. Mushrooms, Herbs, Fruits and Vegitables Dehydrate with DRYCERATOP Gardeners can preserve more food in less space by dehydrating the excess at harvest time. DRYCERATOP works even in cool weather so you can dehydrate all fall. Surplus food is cheap at harvest time, save money all year by preserving food from the farmers market at harvest time. Dehydrated vegetables are preferable to canned and make great flavorful nutritious ingredients for soups. Prepairing fruits and vegitabes for DRYCERATOP Herbalists will like that you can choose to dehydrate low and slow, minimizing the loss of fragile or volatile elements like fragrances or more elusive nutrients. This makes DRYCERATOP ideal for teas, seasonings or traditional medicines. All without using any energy from the grid! HOW IT WORKS DRYCERATOP is incredibly simple! The jar, set in the sun, heats up from solar gain. The solar panel powers a small fan. The warm circulating air can carry away the water in food quickly. The fan and solar panel will last for many years. DRYCERATOP works with ""wide mouth"" standard Mason Jars. DRYCERATOP LOVES HOPTOP DRYCERATOP Dehydrator and HOPTOP to Brew and Ferment HOPTOP is a mason jar Fermenting lid. It was funded on Kickstarter and has been successful ever since. We are offering the perfect pairing DRYCERATOP and HOPTOP in one reward. With this set you can brew, ferment, and dehydrate in Mason jars the options are limitless. Science and STEM Arduino time temperature and humidity logging DRYCERATOP has been thoroughly tested. It automatically creates perfect drying conditions when placed in full sunlight and faced towards the sun. If desired, higher temperatures can be achieved by putting a black card stock ""solar collector"" in the jars. Temperatures and relative humidity and airflow are comparable to plug in dehydrators. With a black sheet of cardstock we can achieve 120F+ with 60F ambient temperature. Relative humidity hovers between 5% and 15% Depending on many factors. Solar dehydration of food has many factors ambient temp, ambient humidity, surface area, surface membrane, and water content of food but also sun angle and atmosphere. These many variables make it very hard to characterize a general formula for how food dries but it has been done in many scientific papers. The most comprehensive we found is here. Testing 5 DRYCERATOP at once with Arduino In order to test DRYCERATOP we used and Arduino data logger. Temperature and Relative Humidity (RH) was logged to an SD card and graphed for 5 test cells. If this you are interested in the Science and STEM aspects of DRYCERATOP we will detail our process and arduino code on our website. Time lapse rig just for fun DRYCERATOP 4HR TIMELAPSE"

You'll be able to select your pin choice via a survey that will be sent out if the project is fully backed within the time limit and if for any reason you'd like to change your selection before shipping feel free to message me! I came up with the initial idea while out to brunch with my boyfriend. We were having mimosas and discussing the Game of Thrones episodes we had just watched the night before. If you follow me on Instagram, you're aware of how popular my current ferret pins are. Well, because of that, we started discussing what Game of Thrones ferrets may look like. I started with Daenarys and one of the first things I decided was to give her mini ferret-dragons. I ended up doodling this design on a napkin and several weeks later I finalized 6 Game of Thrones Ferret designs!! Everything is ferreted over. The dragons are ferrets. Ghost is a ferret. The sword hilts are ferrets. Ferrets...everywhere... Here are some of my pins from BOTH my Battitude shop and also my Eriu Studios shop to give you an idea of what the final product may end up looking like.  Late May- Kickstarter Launches  Late June - Kickstarter Ends  Late June/Early July- Surveys sent out  Mid July - Kickstarter funds become available  Mid July - Production order placed Late July - Pins arrive and we will begin packaging and shipping all orders out  Late July-Early August- Pins will be delivered to you! For international backers: International parcels are shipped using a Global Advantage Program. This postage method is untracked in order to keep costs low for international backers. Also, please be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly! Pledging towards the campaign is completely risk-free! Payment will not be taken from you until after the campaign is finished and only if it is successful. Pledging via kickstarter helps me raise funds for the manufacture of the pins, including cost of the pin itself as well as backing cards, packaging, shipping materials and kickstarter fees (10%!) The reason I produce a little more that necessary in quantities acts as a safety net in case certain designs are more popular than others, and so the pins can also be made available after the kickstarter has ended to the general public! Thinking about changing your pledge? You can click the 'Manage Your Pledge' button on the campaign page, or by clicking your current reward tier and then 'Change Your Pledge'! Here you can change your reward tier to a different reward tier, or you can add on an amount to your tier! Because the pictures shown on the Kickstarter are mock-ups, colors may vary slightly and, If necessary, there may be slight changes in the design to prevent manufacturing problems, but the overall aesthetic and design will stay the same. During and after the Kickstarter, it is my goal to keep things running as smoothly as possible and to keep you regularly updated both here and on my social media.

She ends up on a journey to discover why as well as other hidden secrets from her past. It has been compared to a ""more feminist 'Game of Thrones',"" as it features LGBTQIA characters, strong female characters, and multiple instances of people fighting back against oppression. All that said, ""The Mage Stone"" is far less bloody, and there will likely be no out-right nudity. Agreeing to join our cast, is the well-known performer, Simonna.

My name is Alex and I write novels about gryphons based in the modern world. This kickstarter is to help me publish the second installment of The Gryphon Generation, and provide some fun goodies to existing fans as well as newcomers. Introduction to the story The modern world as we know it has been transformed with the arrival of sentient Gryphons. These man created beings now live among us and take part in society, but not without repercussions from closed minded humans. Some people argue that these beasts should not have the same rights as them and are appalled by their creation. Others believe the Gryphons should live their lives just as humans do, without red tape and hurdles to jump through. With the popularity of the new Gryphon sport, Gryphball, many humans have changed their opinions about the beasts. Gryphball is now a worldwide phenomenon, outpacing every other sport in existence and the players are put on a pedestal of society. We follow the story of Johnathen, a human male, and Thyra, a female gryphoness that are a married couple in Georgia. Until recently, the thought of an interspecies couple outraged many people, but has been accepted in main society. The righteous half, however, have fought every step of the way to keep such marriages illegal and to convince others these couples are an abomination. Johnathen and Thyra meet many friends along the way who accept and support them for who they are. Many find the relationship comical and interesting, especially the rare gryphons Thyra comes across in the southern states. When Thyra accepts an offer to become part of her first Gryphball team, she meets her new best friends, Rachel, Antonio and Aadhya. The Drive I am extremely passionate about writing, but it is not my fulltime job. I work in the car manufacturing field as a technician, and write in my spare time. I also practice falconry with my redtail hawk, Ranger who I love like my own family. Gryphons and Gryphon novels have been a tremendous part of my life. They have helped me escape to new worlds and let my imagination flow. All I hope for is people to enjoy this new installment of my series and help them escape into their own imagination. Rewards! ****STRETCH GOAL #1**** 2500$ UNLOCKED! The Anfang design will be added to the pin and sticker Tiers NOW for the fun part! With incredible help from many talented friends, we have collaborated to bring you a fun tier of rewards! Stickers and pins designed by my friend, Royalty! The Redtails Gryphball team merchandise designed by Fleeks! And, of course, the books themselves. Thank you for looking through this Kickstarter and I hope you will join me in making this next installment something memorable!"

Edward is 15 years of age and is optimistic about his first year of high school. He is looking forward to meeting new people but his optimism soon dwindles when he becomes the target of a group of bullies. Never having dealt with bullying before, Edward has a difficult time coping with the situation. He is reluctant to turn to his ex-military father for fear of being told to �man-up� and doesn�t want to be a snitch either and so Edward becomes withdrawn. Edward�s mom is busy getting her life put back together after the move. She has become preoccupied with her new part-time realtor job to have noticed Edward�s emotional change. While Edward is sitting on the street curb late one night, a girl (Gayle) comes rolling up in a wheelchair. A friendship soon blossoms between the two and Edward opens up about his problem. Gayle explains to Edward that she became paralyzed from being pushed down the stairs after by bullies while taking up for a class mate. Gayle convinces Edward to report the bullies to the school authorities. He finds hope causes a great weight to be lifted off his shoulders. Then things goes terrible wrong. Purpose I feel that ""Such A Good Life campaign"" will be important to those who have suffered from bullying and the depression that follows. While writing this script, I have had to confront and have defeated some of the demons that have plagued me over four decades by realizing that I was not alone in my torment. That is why I feel that this movie is important in helping others will be a help to others. Not just the ones who have been bullied, but those who are bullies. Summary It is nothing new that people of all walks of life have either been or have known someone who has been bullied. There have been many previously released movies dealing with the topic of bulling. But this movie gives a unique view point on the how a bullied person handles and the long reaching consequence of bulling I�m Paul Stratton, age 57 years old and have dealt with the ramifications from bulling from 40 years ago. This film will open a frank and honest dialog on bulling among peoples of all ages and backgrounds. Once this film is completed, we plan to take it and reach out to the community in order to help others. We are so confident in this project that we have donated thousands of dollars into it. We must not fail in our attempt to help others. What We Need & What You Get We even though we have donated thousand of dollars into this project, we still need $9,500 more. We have hired professional actors from across America to bring the talent we need for this film. We offer perks ranging from: Autographed Items. Private Screenings, Cast Dinner � Walk on Roles Most Monies will go to the Actors, Room, Board, the rest will go towards enhancing the movie quality. The Impact This film is important to help those who have been bullied to know they are not alone. 410 Productions have worked with musicians creating music videos and movie shorts. I have put parts of my life in this film for all to see in the sincerest attempt to help others with bulling. Other Ways You Can Help We understand financially burdens, but your help is still needed by spreading our project to others. Again, this movie project will be completed one way or another. It is up to you to help make it better. Again, my deepest thanks for taking an interest and your time in looking at our project."

WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS REDHEAD? GUNSLINGER. SURVIVOR. CURSE CHASER. LEGEND. She is the star of The Few and Cursed in what can be described as a Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets the Old West comic book series. This is the ideal comic book for any Western, Adventure or Supernatural fan! It's been seventy years since most of the water in the world was just gone overnight in a mysterious apocalyptic event. And even though what was left of mankind found a way to adapt and survive using water, the most valuable asset on the planet, as currency, survival turned the world into a wicked wasteland where it's either kill or be killed. And evil not only endured, it blossomed. People turned to dark arts, old tales of mischief and curses to survive. Red is a hardened survivor that was born in this reality and now fights to protect the innocent. As for every darkness there is also light among the few and cursed are those willing to fight to bring balance to the lands: the Curse Chasers. SO THE REDHEAD IS-- --a Curse Chaser, right. Every whisper in the night about something terrible, something supernatural, something evil and the Redhead is off to hunt it down. And she's become exceedingly good at it. WHAT KIND OF MONSTERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY? Shockingly evil and devastatingly wicked. That kind. Creatures spat back straight from hell that should never exist in the first place. But desperate times call for desperate measures and people turned to the darkest corners of the world to survive... A poisoned vial, a cursed coin, a hangman's tree, all ways common folks can become powerful beyond measure despite what they might become in the process. Chief among those monsters The Crows of Mana'Olana - the villains of our first story arc. CROWS OF WHERE? Mana'Olana - a small town in the Honolulu Mountains region (what was once Hawaii). That's where the bedtime story about giant Crows that kidnap children in the silent of night comes from. Oh and while they are taking the kids, they also shred the grown-ups to pieces. For years the Crows of Mana'Olana have preyed on the innocent unchecked. Until she came along... the Redhead. THAT SOUNDS AWESOME! HOW MANY ISSUES ARE PLANNED? The Crows of Mana'Olana story will be told in six (6) issues - each with 32 fully colored pages in standard comic book format 6'625 x 10'25in. The first five books have already been published thanks to the amazing support of many of you. This Kickstarter is to print issue #6 - the epic conclusion! If this is your first time hearing about The Few and Cursed here's an issue by issue synopsis: (skip this section to avoid potential spoilers!!) Issue #1 introduces the Redhead to readers as we get to see her chase a local Indian myth, the Tsilkali, a giant snake preying on the small town of Mountain View, California. In Issue #2 we follow the Redhead to the border of San Andreas and see her first meeting with a 94-year old survivor of The Reaping, Jebediah Younger. They team up to cross the Pacific after the Crows of Mana�Olana and learn firsthand how real they really are� and how dangerous. In the next installment of the series, Issue #3, the Redhead and Jebediah finally make it to Mana�Olana. In a flashback story, readers learn what the Redhead is truly capable of. Issue #4 features the very first big battle with the Crows in Mana'Olana. We also go deeper in Red's fatherly relationship with Jebediah and unravel some of his background. In Issue #5, the Redhead comes face to face with the Crows in a violent death match and finds out who they really are. We're now working towards the conclusion in Issue #6 and Red will not walk away clean from this last encounter... Work on Issue #6 has just begun but you are more than welcome to check out some previews for the first three pages below: WOULD YOU MIND SHARING SOME PAGES FROM EACH ISSUES? What's a great story without some terrific art to go along with it, right? Fabiano Neves is a master storyteller with 20 years of experience working with comics and The Few and Cursed is his passion project. Needless to say all that passion really oozes onto the pages: Issue #1 - Preview Issue #2 - Preview Issue #3 - Preview Issue #4 - Preview Issue #5 - Preview [Issue #6 - Preview shot] WHAT ABOUT THAT CHRONICLES OF THE FEW AND CURSED ANTHOLOGY? The Chronicles of The Few and Cursed is an anthology featuring short stories by top artists set in the same universe. The book collects 8 brand new stories - including two exclusive Redhead tales - for a total of 96 fully colored pages and was produced both in softcover and hardcover formats. Some of our higher tiers designed for new readers already have Chronicles included but you will also be able to add it to any pledge after the Kickstarter ends through our pledge manager. With Chronicles we were able to explore the four corners of the world and how other cultures around the planet have dealt and continue to deal with the disappearance of most of the water. Visit a Persian city overtaken by horrifying Daevas, raid a tomb in Egypt after the Eye of Horus and get lost in a shark cemetery in the Australian outback. Our main dish is obviously The Few and Cursed: Crows of Mana'Olana issue #6 in all its' different variant covers but we're also offering all the back-issues so new readers have access to the full story in one fell swoop.

Backers can choose to go home with a set of 8x large format posters including a gorgeous piece of art by Tou Vue exclusively commissioned for this set!

Here's everything unlocked so far: FELIPE CAGNO - Writer & Editor I'm 35 years old and I have been working pretty much exclusively with comics since 2013. I have a background in film making, got my Master's degree at Chapman University and wrote and directed my first feature-length film in 2012, A Bullet With No Name. My first comic book series was The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand epic adventure adapted from a feature screenplay I wrote while at Chapman and working at producing companies like Arad Pictures, Weed Road and Misher Films. I went on to create and publish the anthology of short stories 321: Fast Comics, the original graphic novels Too Good to Be True and Choices: A Hero's Tale. In 2017 I was the recipient of a prestigious cultural grant in Brazil to produce the sci-fi book Adagio and I also have another creator-owned series in the works, the spy thriller Classified. One of the coolest projects I've worked on was a short story for Planet of the Apes published by comic book app Madefire and 20th Century Fox. FABIANO NEVES - Artist Professionally working as an artist since he was nineteen years old, Fabiano was first published in the US in 2000 with Xena Warrior Princess. He then went on to work for Marvel, DC, Dark Horse and Dynamite among other publishers. A talented colorist as well, Fabiano has done both interior pages and covers for Xena, Marvel Zombies, Red Sonja, Robocop, JLA�s Vibe and Constantine among many other titles. The Few and Cursed represents Fabiano�s first creator-owned project. TIAGO BARSA - Colorist Newcomer Tiago Barsa has been with us since issue #3 and has taken over coloring duties on issue #5 for the remainder of the series. Every page he carefully crafts always surprises me and Fabiano for the sheers quality behind them. His credits include work for Ape Entertainment and Ed Benes Studio. DEYVISON MANES - Letterer One of the best letterers in Brazil, Deyvison has built an impressive body of work over the past couple of years and is slowly tackling more and more titles for the US comic market. He's been with The Few and Cursed since the beginning and has also done every other book I've ever published. He is also a crafty writer and has his own creator-owned sci-fi book - Justi�a Sideral. Fabiano and I are all about 100% transparency and we believe you deserve to know where your money is going to. All of the money raised by Kickstarter will be used towards four things: Production, Printing, Shipping and Fees. Here�s a breakdown of our costs based on previous TFAC Kickstarters: Total - $16,777.57 Any additional funding over the initial goal will first cover whatever is left from the above and all the extras like collectible cards, pin-ups, magnets, etc, and production of future books of The Few and Cursed saga. I've also substantially raised the budget for shipping to make sure you get your rewards as fast and safely as possible. We pack and mail our rewards using hard cardboard photo mailers plus dust-free clear plastic bags and comic book sized card-boards. *** For higher tiers or packages with extra books we use Easy-Fold Mailers: *** We also ship our prints using thick cardboard mailer tubes: Our primary goal is to entertain you and release the series entirely through Kickstarter. It all starts with YOU and YOUR support so thanks so much for sticking with us. If you have any questions please send me a message or shoot an e-mail at cagno100@gmail.com"

I started experimenting with crafting these pieces as a way to make a present for those special people in my life and show that for that moment they were all that mattered. It wasn�t until I started sharing the progress with others that people were interested in sharing those special moments with their loved ones as well. That is how My Stars and Planets was born, out of a desire to preserve the moment held dearest to the heart. Furthering our story of humanity and marking those moments, that for a moment the stars were ours. ""My Stars and Planets was born, out of a desire to preserve the moment held dearest to the heart. "" THE CONSTELLATIONS The back image is the constellations and stars, as visible from your location on that special day. Choose from 6 different images around the outside, each having a special meaning. PLANETARY LOCATIONS In Astrology, the Natal Chart is the planets position at the time of birth. We capture that moment and put it on top of your constellations and stars. These are unique to every person on earth. No-one will have the exact same alignment, each moment belongs to that person. Choose from 6 different backdrop themes: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Step 1 Chart Creation: We use the customers specified, time, location and date to design a astrology chart as well as a star / Constellation chart. Step 2 Chart Conversion: Once the display is created, it is converted to allow our laser etcher to engrave the art into the acrylic glass. The glass pieces are separated to give the depth between the astrology chart and the constellation / Star Chart. Step 3 Wood Selection and Cutting: We hand select our walnut and fine woods, from a local exotic wood mill. We look at each piece for 3 things. Grain Color, Grain Style and Age of the board. This ensures that each piece is beautiful and unique. We begin to cut and shape the wood, re-sawing and milling to the size required for the displays. Step 4 Refinement and Center Piece Creation: After the base, the case have been created. We check for quality and refine the wood preparing for assembly. This is when the Main Center Piece is etched and refined, we check each center piece for clarity and crispness. Sometimes they require multiple attempts, which is fine with us, we want the quality to be right. After the center piece is installed, we install the color lights that the customer decided on, and connect all the wires. The lights are powered by a 9v Battery and has an on/off switch on the bottom of the base. Step 5 Assembly: When assembling we look over each piece, fine sand where needed and stain with a natural wood stain. This allows the beauty of the walnut to show and pops with the color of the lights. Step 6 Shipping: Each item is shipped with care and a thank you note. Current Schedule of Production: Turn Around time from order to shipping, is 2 - 3 weeks currently. That includes the design work, the wood crafting, assembling and finishing of the product. Goal of Production at full funding: When we meet our funding goal here, we are looking at being able to cut the production time in half, where we can ship as little as 1 week depending on volume. Custom Gift Box / Storage Box - A box that will fit the Astro-Display, beautifully! Variety of Woods Offered - Looking adding PurpleHeart, Blood Wood and more. Custom Ornaments - Convert the central display into an ornament display. Astrology Clock - A live motion ""clock"" to see the current planets vs where they were when your event happened. and more!

I decided that the best thing I could do is help plant more trees. Since our product is mainly wood, replenishing it would be a the right course of action. I started with some research and decided that I would donate through https://www.nationalforests.org. They have a small business partnership program which I signed up for and am now working out the details. To make it super simple, what we will do is for ever $25 dollars Spent with My Stars and Planets we will help plant at least 1 tree. It is our way of giving back to nature, as nature has allowed us to make so many beautiful items. We want to help bring back forests, and build natural homes for the wildlife. Thank you, for helping us give back."

What about customers using Apply products? Development throughout the Kickstarter campaign will be limited to Android functionality only. After the Kickstarter launch has successfully been completed, an iOS version of the Customer portal will be released shortly after. I want to ensure the launch goes smoothly first. If funding provides I will release a iOS version of the other portals, however post launch development will primarily be focused on the implementation of additional features for a while. About me: I have been an avid programmer since before computers were screeching through phone lines. I enjoy making functional software to problem solve. Now a days big company delivery and restaurants attract lots of customers through the one thing most Americans keep in their hands. Their phone, a gateway to pretty much anything. Since eating is a habit, it's easy to expect a connection between the two. As someone who has ordered many a meal online I often find it a lot harder than it needs to be. Log in?! To a pizza joint?! I either use my secure password or try to remember a new one...which I won't. Don't worry your customers can use a 3rd party to order from you and make a killing off your labor... Or you can reach your customers directly. Save them money, earn more business and promote your products. There are options like this already out there. They average in the hundreds of dollars monthly, or take a percentage of each sale you make. Or, you can choose to exchange payment the same way you always do and keep others paws off it. By backing this project you are helping to empower small restaurants compete in today's market. The inspiration to this project is my father. He has been a chef most of his life and now owns his own small restaurant. It is inside the American Legion in town. It provides a great pool of good customers but because there is a membership requirement he is missing out on most of the potential customers in the area. Nothing prohibits take out or delivery, but he told me about the costs of working with companies that handle online ordering. I was floored and could only imagine how stiff that would cut his profits. Freelance Restaurant Menu was started to solve that very problem. Early development image - The price is hiding behind the cheesy goodness!"

And this year, on the 10th Anniversary, I want to share my story Shattered at the biggest Fringe Festival in the world - the Edinburgh Fringe Festival! I need your help to get there! Shattered is a serio-comedy solo show that uses humor to heal. It's a fast-paced, comedic and heart-breakingly raw journey through dating, dysfunction and sexual devastation - told through the voices of 35+ characters. Shattered ultimately tells the story of one individual picking up the broken pieces of herself and putting them back together again. The Impact Shattered was created to explain the complex psychological fallout of sexual assault - a tragedy far too many people experience. Whether an audience member can (or hopefully cannot) relate to the story told, Shattered brings voice to the darkest parts of the one's experience and the power of the human spirit to rise again.

With over 3,500 shows - the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the biggest in the world and provides an unparalleled opportunity to showcase my work and story! Sexual violence is a global problem that does not discriminate. I cannot imagine the impact I might be able to have by performing my show 25 times at the Edinburgh Fringe July 31-Aug 26! August 2019 will mark the 10th year anniversary of the assault that I talk about in the show - so, for me, it's incredibly important to take Shattered to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year. The past can never be undone, but sharing my story is an opportunity to re-write August for the future and help others do the same. The Funds Taking Shattered to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival will require costs to perform and live for the month (theatre rental, promotion/marketing, fees, accommodations, etc.) I've invested what I can to fund the project, but will need an additional $10k to complete the obligations. Stretch goals - Anything raised above the initial $10k will go toward incentive distributions, plane tickets/per-diem living expenses, etc. Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute? No worries! Here are some ways you can help: - Please comment, like and share the campaign! Every bit helps to engage people, raise awareness and support Shattered Follow @dianavarco and visit: www.supportshattered.com - Share your story!

Join OYL Theater Company in supporting the development of a new play PIECES OF THE MOON by Nick Flint � an expansive project that examines the 1969 moon landing and the socio-political atmosphere that surrounded it. ABOUT PIECES OF THE MOON: PIECES OF THE MOON is a new theatrical event that parallels two sides of America during a paradigm shift. We examine the energetic rise of the Black Arts Movement beside the scientific marvel of touching the stars. This cosmically adventurous work draws on the personal lives of the three Apollo 11 astronauts alongside the life and music of Gil Scott-Heron... highlighting the vastly different experiences of America at the time: clashing economic and social priorities, the rise of the Black Arts Movement, and the collision of events that formulated the space race. The script merges pieces of historical text, including political speeches, sermons, poems, conversations, letters, phone calls, the lunar landing radio transcript, music, and song. We explore how connections and divisions between people and communities shape who we are, who we become, and how we are remembered. This will be a unique theatrical event featuring aerial acrobatics, live music, ballroom dancing and a diverse cast ranging in age from 12 to 70 years� PIECES OF THE MOON is a massive production with massive talent! Apollo 11 launches SUPPORT PIECES OF THE MOON: A serious study into the moon landing, the events surrounding it, and how we remember this historic event, PIECES OF THE MOON is a complex spectacle. After 3 development workshops, the participation of over 20 actors, an aerial showing at 5th Wall Studios in Brooklyn, and with the extraordinary support and partnership of Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, TX and The Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville, AR, this project has exciting momentum. The funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will cover the next phase of the show's development: an extended residency with our circus arts partners in the Fall of 2019; purchasing the first flying rigs for the show; two more script development workshops and marketing outreach to put together a regional tour. Creative workshops so far have brought Ethan Slater (Broadway: Lead in Spongebob Squarepants) and Adesola Osakalumi (Broadway: Lead in Fela!) together. Past workshops and future development costs for the project total over $80,000. And this is before we hit the final four-week rehearsal period prior to the Houston premiere. ANYTHING we raise above and beyond this campaign�s goal will go towards the production, and we hope that with your help we can both meet and exceed our goal! Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin WHEN, WHERE, & WHO: OYL has been developing PIECES OF THE MOON since July 2018. PIECES OF THE MOON will be directed by Ianthe Demos with Movement Direction by Natalie Lomonte. PIECES OF THE MOON will receive three readings at Walton Arts Center�s Artosphere Festival this June 19, 20 and 21. The cast includes Danny Bernardy, Xavier Davis, Nathaniel Kent, Christina Bennett Lind, Adesola Osakalumi, Cristina Pitter and Richard Saudek. More information HERE.

October 2018 Aerial Workshop at 5th Wall Studios MORE ABOUT OYL: One Year Lease Theater Company (OYL) is a professional theater company based in New York City. OYL�s mission is to create bold, athletic new works of theater that draw on the power of collaboration � the group, the ensemble, the chorus � to express bold visions of our collective human experience. Our vision is to create experiences for audiences that transcend the ordinary, transport the spirit and embrace the magical. We are deeply passionate about the artform of theater and seek to inspire the next generation of creators through our educational programs. Over the last two years, OYL�s mainstage programming has focused on creating new work inspired by important historical events. By taking seminal moments in time and looking at them from varying perspectives we throw into question our collective memories, amnesia, and responsibility to the past. We hope to initiate and support important inter-generational and cross-cultural conversations through the theater. OYL�s work has been critically acclaimed as �first rate young actors� (Charles Isherwood, The New York Times), �theatrical witchcraft� (Scott Brown, New York Magazine), �riveting theater� (Ed Siegel, Boston�s NPR), �fiery and fantastical� (Eric Sundermann, Village Voice), �screams of novelty� (Alexandra Villarreal, Huffington Post), �playfully poisonous� (Terry Byrne, Boston Globe), �a gleaming portrait of our collective contemporary existence� (Andy Propst, American Theater Web), �a celebration of theatrical energy� (Gerald Berkowitz, The Stage), ""a captivating, visceral spectacle"" (Morgan Kinney, Houstonia Magazine), ""exquisite"" (Suzanna Bowling, Times Square Chronicles). OYL has received two Drama Desk nominations in NYC as well as a Stage Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

My product is a Female Fitness Game in Mobile App, it is already developed and launched for Russian speaking community of the globe in July 2018 (you can search for 4FitnessGirls in iOS/Android App Store or visit www.4FitnessGirls.com, and now I do localization of the product in the USA market. Many more features to develop in the future, but current product is already valid to be used for first app users. My plan & schedule? - Right now I am looking to do localization of the app and kick-off the ground CPI marketing campaign, it would be enough to start generating revenue in the USA market and re-direct it again to new marketing campaigns. Moreover, I am in Berkeley, CA startup incubator called The Batchery and demo day where I will pitch to potential investors is June 12, so anything could change dramatically and fly up to the sky after that. What�s my budget? - Product is developed in Russian language, localization and kick-off marketing campaign will cost 2000$ and 3000$ respectively. Yes, it seems to be a small amount of money compared to what I've already spent on development and production, but it is a reality of startup. Why I care? - This project is my ""baby"" for the last 2 years. I am mom of 2 small kids and this project is actually my third kid, believe it or not. I cannot wait to show everybody all the features that I've developed and let everyone to try unique product that will motivate, support and help to not just start fitness and healthy lifestyle journey, but also to move on and on.

VISION STATEMENT We envision a collective run entirely by college students where theatrical knowledge can be shared, peer-to-peer, to foster a motivated, versatile education in the arts. THE HOLE IN THE MARKET Before we come of age, summertime performing arts education is abundant in the greater Burlington area with programs such as Flynnarts and Very Merry Theatre. Upon graduation, the opportunities to participate in a musical over the summer cease, unless we book professionally in one of the three regional theaters that operate during the summer: Northern Stage, Skinner Barn, Lost Nation, all of which require a lengthy commute from Burlington. Verdantrics� productions will open up close-to-home opportunities for every kind of student who enjoys working in the theater, be it backstage, at the light booth, designing the set, choreographing a few numbers, or performing in the musical itself. Unlike all other Burlington area educational summer theatre programs, participation is free. Verdantrics understands the hefty financial burdens put on college students, so we�re striving to provide a space where we can educate each other using the skills learned at our various universities free of cost. GOALS IN THE SHORT TERM, Verdantrics is producing 35mm: A Musical Exhibition to establish ourselves in the community and teach ourselves what it takes to be local producers. Next year, we hope to put on a musical with a bigger troupe and continue gathering a diverse range of college student interest. IN THE LONG TERM, we hope to pass on ownership of Verdantrics to fresh college students when we earn our degrees to ensure the company�s peer education aspect remains and flourishes. At that point, we can provide mentorship in producing while passing the torch down to the next generation of the troupe. The creativity and ambition of the collegiate mind is immortal! FOR FUNDRAISING, we have a budget goal of $10,000. Our wonderful sponsor PCC has offered us a challenge grant: For every dollar raised, it will be matched up to $5,000. That means every cent you donate is worth twice as much! Our goal here on Kickstarter is only $1,000 to ensure that we reach it and can access our funds, as Kickstarter has funny rules about that. But if you or anyone you know is interesting in contributing more, just shoot us an email at verdantrics@gmail.com to talk more! DISCLAIMER: If you donate in one of the categories that have prizes, please email us letting us know who you are and what you donated, otherwise we will not be able to contact you to arrange your thank-you gift(s).

Aloe is a miraculous healing plant (not a cactus but a member of the lily family) that many people see as a symbol of peace, healing and gentleness. It is therefore a perfect symbol for a publication that seeks to reach out and mitigate against harm and oppression of all beings of the earth, particularly for those who cannot speak for themselves -- marginalized and underrepresented people, all animals and the environment. And we will be placing a very strong emphasis on Food and everything about Food, from growing to preparing to eating to celebrating -- and all completely vegan. This magazine will be a Foodie's delight! Please check out our website at: Aloe Veritas - Arts and Letters Of the Earth More About Who We Are And Why We're Here We believe that perpetrating the harm and suffering of animals, even those we call 'livestock', is deeply immoral and unnatural to human beings. Meat production is totally unnecessary, never has and never will mitigate against poverty or starvation, and now cattle grazing is proving to be the largest environmental threat the earth has ever known. The amazon forest -- the lungs of our planet -- is daily being whittled away to make room for more and more cattle. And all the while these worldwide herds are producing methane gas and other pollution problems that are far more destructive to the atmosphere than fossil fuels and other industrial emissions combined. So far, corporations and Big Agriculture have been very successful at hiding these facts. Further, Aloe Veritas is predicated on the understanding that history has proven that once the killing and consumption of animals is accepted as normal, then oppression, murder and even genocide of people is a concomitant. The two are never separate. The same disdain for life and willingness to harm and consume or oppress animals (human and non-human) leads inevitably to the third element: the drive to exploit and destroy the environment that sustains us all. When caring and empathy have been turned off, no one matters anymore and nothing is safe from harmful exploitation, not even the earth itself. Therefore we see veganism not as an ancillary issue, but as an understanding of life that is paramount and primary. The vegan worldview can provide a vast umbrella under which new ideas and ways of living and thinking can be nurtured and created. True, whole societies and their economies will have to change, but within the rubric of loving and protecting Mother Earth and all who live within her is a great fertile expanse of amazing possibilities! Aloe Veritas and the growing vegan movement heralds not so much the end of an old way of life, but the beginnings of incredible new ways to love, experience, grow, create, learn and live in harmony with all other beings -- human and nonhuman-- on our beautiful planet. Grandmother Tree of Aloe Veritas What We Will Cover Aloe Veritas is therefore not a narrow perspective but a wide open field. We will cover broad range of topics, most certainly Food in all its aspects: political, social, aesthetics, availability -- including recipes, cooking, gardening, farming, restaurants, and any art forms that celebrate food. And we will cover the economics of food and food production and all things that affect the economic interactions of people, animals and the environment. The rights and preservation of all animals that we share the earth and the environment with will be examined and investigated. And we will cover the environment itself, the various pollution problems, the power struggles, the politics, and the stories of hope, improvement and success. Aloe Veritas will also devote coverage to the rights and issues of human beings, and include the viewpoints of Feminism, the LGBTQI movement, inequality studies, the black lives matter movement, and all voices that speak out against discrimination in all its hydra-headed forms. All of these groups and viewpoints essentially address the same destructive greed and inhumanity that is threatening to destroy all life on earth as we have ever known it. Aloe Veritas will feature and share in the arts, literature, journalism, non-fiction, films, podcasts, music and live performance -- any form of creative expression which honors and heals the earth. Artists, authors, performers and freelancers will be encouraged to send us their work. We may have to start out without much ability to pay contributors but our goal is to become able to pay according to industry standards for high quality contributions as soon as possible. We will always have a home for great humor, including satire and other types of comedy and comic writing, review and art. We hope to have our own cartoonist someday... And we will be willing make space for differing points of view and those who disagree and will include a ""letters to the Editor"" section and an op-ed forum. Reader collaboration, feedback, and participation will always be encouraged. Funding and the Future Once we are funded, Aloe Veritas will transform from a blog site to an online magazine platform which will include a professional, fully functional website which will be monetized and capable of accepting donations, and it will accept and process paid subscriptions to the magazine. We may accept paid advertisements that align with our mission and principles and we may display unpaid notices and public announcements from organizations and entities on a similar basis. We do intend to partner with seller(s) of Aloe and other products and will offer a ""Store"" page on our site. We also intend to sell books (in partnerships) and other items that relate to veganism, or are of interest to our readers. These partnerships will generate commissions on sales that will provide ongoing funding for Aloe Veritas, to be used mainly for the purpose of supporting the website and ongoing production of the magazine; and this will enable us to pay contributors who provide material (written, visual graphics, or other media) for this publication. Aloe Veritas will follow the nonprofit organizational model and will seek grant funding from various sources on a continuing basis. We will also recognize, reward and thank all of our supporters, subscribers and funders to the best of our ability, including a ""Friends of Aloe Veritas"" page and other forms of recognition throughout the magazine and throughout the year."

Enrique Estrada The purpose of this project We want to create an ecological system that include a natural reserve and a bees sanctuary to stop bees extinction and reforest the planet. did you know... That May 20th is the international day of the bees designated by the UN? That bees are the most valuable insect of the earth and whitout them 90% of the food would not exists? That bees pollinate more than 170,000 species of different plants? According to forbes article that is pointing Morgan Freeman�s effort to preserve bee lives creating a sanctuary in his property in Mississippi, we want to emulate that project here in El Salvador, the project is called SAVE THIS WORLD. Bee sanctuary Save this world Natural reserve How was this idea born? have you seen all consequences due global warming and climate change? according with UN we are about to face the sixth massive extinction of species, and in this occasion it is totally caused by human being actions..could you believe that? In danger due global warming We are creating very awesome projects, that I�m sure will succeed But...what is the use of having a lot of money if in a near future we won�t have a place to enjoy it? It is supposed that we have kids, brothers,wife, husband, parents right? If so..this project should matter to you also. How do you call this pic? Happiness could be? What do we have? As we already have the defined area to do this project we have began all steps to legalize it with correspondent Salvadorians authorities (MAG, MARN) That process is practically done. It means that we have the basics to begin. through MARN, We already have an agreement also with major universities who will provide us engineering, veterinaries and biologist to initiate the project and count in that way, with professional support To establish bases and begin with the project as planned. What do we need? Since we already have the designated area and support from local authorities, we need funds to start implementing all the steps to realize this system. How will it be implemented? During the rest of 2019, we must secure the area to reforest, and the area for bees sanctuary it means two perimeter inside one. June 2020, at this time we must have at least 55 bee hives already installed in the reserve, and the well trained staff to take care of them.

A friendly challenge to settle the debate as to who�s illustrations were strong enough to be published in the leading motorsport magazines of the era. Giorgio won, racing headfirst into a career analyzing the technical designs of Formula 1 cars and quickly taking pole position in a journalistic area that didn�t exist before him. His amazing artwork skills that have allowed millions of fans around the world to better understand Formula 1. Giorgio and Colin Chapman For the last 50 years, and after a record breaking 814 Grand Prix covered, Giorgio has profiled every change in design and engineering for every car on the grid. In a sport where victory is determined by mere hundredths of a second, it is often the most minute change that makes all the difference. Giorgio interviewed by journalists Giorgio�s trained eye allowed him to painstakingly recreate and document each new design without missing a beat. He studied ground effect aerodynamics, passionately recreated the designs of the infamous, hell-raising V12 engines with poetic precision and documented the integration of the now commonplace carbon fiber chassis. Suffice to say, there is nothing Giorgio hasn�t seen. Giorgio at Ferrari's box with Gilles Villeneuve Giorgio�s F1 career began at the 1969 Monaco Grand Prix and he simply hasn�t stopped drawing since. He invented a new method of covering Formula 1, and has a unique perspective on the development of the sport. Giorgio's drawings are his legacy; his dream is to make them last for many more years and to go beyond the pages of magazine and websites. This dream inspired the 50 years collection: A series of 12 hand-picked drawings selected from the thousands that make up his archive. These drawings tell the story of Formula 1 over the last five decades. They depict not only the cars and engines, but the creativeness of the engineers and the solutions they brought forward to gain an edge in the ultra-competitive world of F1. These drawings make the perfect set to decorate the living space, office or garage of any Formula 1 fan. The collection is offered in three options each with its own advantages. Made of 100% cotton paper, these prints are robust and have a natural texture that make the colors more vivid. With Gyclee printing and the use of archival ink, the quality is guaranteed. Because these prints come unframed, they give customers the flexibility to be creative in displaying these drawings and also allow for an affordable price point.

My name is Shakira Shipman and I'm a visual artist from Middle of Nowhere, NC who currently resides in Raleigh, NC. ""Fragmented"" 18x24 Acrylic on Canvas I've been painting and drawing since I could properly hold a brush and pencil. Art and pictures have always been a lot easier for me to grasp and understand than words. I used painting as a release from the loud, and sometimes aggressive, forces of the outside world. More importantly, I believe my work offers a degree of healing and peace for the people who look at it. I think it is very important that people surround themselves with art and beautiful pictures because it offers a mental reprieve from the constant onslaught that is daily life. ""Cancer"" Acrylic on Metal [Custom Christmas present for a friend] ""Forest Friends"" Pencil and Colored Pencil on Paper [Custom Christmas present for a friend] ""Spider-Dou"" 9x12 Acrylic on Black Canvas [Custom Christmas present for a friend] I've been dabbling in custom portraits and pictures for people I know, but until very recently I didn't share the works that I did on my on time,for me. Now that I am, people are interested in putting my art in their homes and that blows my mind. I just want to be able to share what I do en masse with the people around me. ""An Unintentional Series: Fragmented, Stifled, Scattered, and Detached"" 18x24 and 16x20 Acrylic on Canvas So, I've decided to create a website and buy the supplies necessary to sell my art to people. I could very well sell the individual canvases but I've seen a demand from multiple people for single pieces and I believe that anyone who wants to own it should be able to. I plan on purchasing a professional grade printer, paper, and inks so that I can make custom prints, on demand, and not have to worry about outside printing companies (which can be expensive and time consuming), and to set up my own website to sell from. Since I am constantly coming out with new paintings, the website would always have a steady flow of new art to select from, as well as the assurance that all old work will stay there until I am no longer able to distribute it. ""Sweet Dreams Series"" Graphite, Ink and Acrylic on Paper My short term goal, which you would be helping me to accomplish, is to be able to sell the prints from my home, but also to display and sell them at art shows and galleries in my area. Raleigh specifically has First Fridays every month, and I'd love to one day be able to participate. I've also been that told I should start a zine, and have been putting in place plans to do so. I'd like to make a sort of art collective of my friends and local artists in my area to help not only spread their work, but offer a peaceful project for them to work on every few months. My long term goal, however, is to be able to open up my own little shop/work studio/gallery. It would be a space specifically for me to express myself artistically and also for people to come to engage with and enjoy my work. The steps that I am beginning to take today will hopefully lead me to that long term goal. ""Pomme"" 9x12 Acrylic on Black Canvas Painting is something I have been doing for a long time, and something I know I will continue to do until I no longer can. It is also the most reliable source of income I can think of, after a regular hourly job, because I know that I will always be putting out work. I will say that selling my art will never compromise the quality because I do this first and foremost for myself. And in the words of the Joker ""If you're good at something, never do it for free."""

It has been my biggest goal and dream for my business - having a physical store where I can be everyday and contribute to my favorite city, Lakeland! And we have finally found a building! This spot is central to downtown Lakeland, right in the heart of the farmer�s market area within great foot-walking traffic on the corner of Bay St. and Kentucky. The building will be open to move in on June 15th and I still cannot believe it! Another incredible business, Honeycomb Bread, will be moving in as well, utilizing the bar space in the back of the building for their delicious handmade bakery goods. Our dream for the space: Lakeland does not have a destination spot like Twenty Seven & Honeycomb will be. The shop will be full of paper goods - greeting cards, art prints, notebooks, wrapping paper, party supplies, etc. It will feature a variety of local makers� work, some little home decor items, and vintage accessories. Honeycomb Bread will be making an amazing menu - for everyone to cuddle up with fresh-baked bread and a cup of tea. We are thrilled to host live music nights, workshops, and outings that cultivate community in downtown Lakeland. We believe Lakeland will be so richly benefitted from this retail space - and we cannot do it without your help! I ask that you would consider contributing to this project to bring sunshine and hope to Lakeland. This is my dream, and I have worked so hard for so long to reach this point. I am so incredibly grateful to so many who have supported me since the start. I�m ready to give you a retail spot of dreams! With the $12,000, we will be: � painting the interior walls � installing new lighting fixtures � furnishing the shop with seating and shelves � purchasing a large inventory of my designs, and wholesale items from other creators (local & beyond) � filling the shop with it�s basic needs - cleaning supplies, a register, speakers, etc. Thank you so much for your support in making this dream a reality!

A couple of years ago I became a caregiver for my father, who was 86 at the time, was recovering from two strokes. While sitting watching TV one night a commercial for visit Australia came on and he said ""I always wanted to go there and now I never will."" The sadness and longing in his voice hit me hard. I looked over and told him, ""Dad, I will make it there for us. I will take a picture of me holding a picture of you and call you and tell you we made it."" At that moment I decided that I don't want to be that person who said they always wanted to and never did! From there my adventure to travel the world relying on a tight budget and small pockets began. My Father and I In 2018, I was able to fulfil this promise on my half year trip around the world. I made it to Australia, with the help of my friend Mike from Australia, I took that picture and called my Dad, who is now 92, and said ""Dad, we mad it!"" It was emotional to say the least! I will never forget that moment overlooking Sydney Harbor. My picture with Dad in Sydney Harbor Calling my Dad from Sydney Harbor Chapter two: Creating a Travel Series While on my second trip on the Camino De Santiago across Spain, I met an amazing group of people from South Africa that were filming a series on Camino called Elders Die Camino. I ended up being in a few episodes and we quickly became friends bonding over traveling, videography, and good food. Kobus and I in Johannesburg, South Africa On the same trip that took me to Australia, Kobus, the camera and drone pilot for the Elders Die Camino series, hosted me in South Africa. During my three week stay there we began to chat about a true budget travel series that would that would not only feature our travels, tips on how to travel with limited resources, as well as showcasing others who decided to live their dreams! Without giving away too much it would be a true budget travel series showing how to travel cheap for those with small budgets. From staying in Hostels to BnB's and more. Taking public transportation, trains and buses to get around and also interviewing someone in each location who decided to live their dreams like me no matter what it is. They would talk about the steps they went through to live their dream and to encourage more people to do the same. This would be a series unlike any other travel series on TV or streaming. We have so many possible ideas to make this very different from fan interaction on episodes and more. Now all we need to do is get the team together, plan out the locations based off of the budget and make it happen! This is where you come in! With your help we can get the team together and film pilot episodes that would later be presented to streaming and TV services to hopefully help this dream be realized. To show people they can live their dreams if they choose to and we can all experience this beautiful world together! Come along this journey with us and thank you for your help and support! I would like to introduce you to the Backpacker Mike team: Kobus Zietsman (Motion camera/Drone pilot/Director) I am a video professional with 16 years industry experience in videography, directing and editing. I have worked on projects ranging from corporates, news, music videos and wildlife, specializing in documentary and reality. As a freelancer with a passion for travel and visual storytelling I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that have taken me all over the world. https://kzietsman2.wixsite.com/kobuszietsman Patrick King (Still Camera/Drone pilot) The simple truth is that I stumbled into photography during university. I was studying Meteorology at the time, but the desire to create images hit me like a ton of bricks, but somehow I was in love with the impact. During the early days of my love affair with the camera I lived in a rural village teaching mathematics and life skills to high school students. During that time I was incredibly lucky to travel on a shoestring to neighboring countries in Southern Africa. Once the honeymoon was over it was time to get a real job. That job was in Washington D.C. and involved photographing businessmen and women, politicians and even the administration of the US at that time. The next decade of my career would include travel to 5 continents for photo assignments. I focus most of my energy on jobs related to lifestyle in the travel and hospitality industry. I reside in Cape Town with my wife, two energetic daughters and two four-legged, furry canines. Of course they hate seeing me getting into the Uber on the way to the airport for the next assignment, but that seems like the norm these days. www.patrickwking.com Jessica Garrett (Marketing Director) I am a creative director with over 10 years of digital art, web design and marketing experience for a wide range of clients.

When I moved to the old capital of Japan three years ago to teach at junior high school, I searched online to buy a detailed black & white street map of the city to decorate my room. But, there were none to come by. Poster companies tended to sell detailed street maps of only the world�s most famous cities, such as New York City, Paris, and London. So, I decided to make a Kyoto map of my own! Thus, the Miyako Map was born. As I now prepare to finish work and leave the country, I see the Miyako Map as my sort of love letter to Kyoto - my adopted home and the beating heart of Japan of old. (Miyako, meaning �capital� in Japanese, is an endearing name often used by the Japanese people to refer to Kyoto City - Japan�s old capital for over 1,000 years before the relocation of power to present-day Tokyo.) The Process I did not trace the map. Referenced from guide books and Google Maps, every shape was measured proportionally by ruler and drawn by hand and eye. Johan, a good friend of mine and a professional architect, kept pushing me to detail the map further and further despite my impatient desire to be done with the project in its less detailed stages. Once I overlaid the pencil with Staedtler pigment-liner pen, I had myself a completed black & white Kyoto map! However, I had come this far (thanks to Johan's persistence). So, I decided to go all in and bring the map to life with watercolor. Half a year after the first pencil mark, I finally put on the finishing touch of watercolor. More than just an illustration of Kyoto, this project bears the marks of me continuously exceeding my initial targets. When I ride my bike down the Kamogawa River to enjoy cherry blossoms, hike up Daimonji Mountain for a sweeping view of Kyoto, or wander the alleys of Kiyamachi to grab dinner with friends, I can envision in my head the corresponding ink lines on the Miyako Map. I do hope that the finished product will inspire you to wander through Kyoto someday and take in its sights, if you haven�t already. The Design The Miyako Map features 95 temples and shrines, 14 universities, the 6 bonfires from Kyoto's mountain fire festival, major rivers and small streams, all above-ground train lines, the Imperial Palace, Nijo Castle, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and several national treasures detailed with watercolor paint. Since the pen work is neither computer generated nor traced from a model, the streets, buildings, and mountains all contain my unique touch and vision. I encourage anyone familiar with Kyoto to find a side street or alleyway on the map that does not exist � I am confident my commitment and eye for detail has left nothing unmarked in the city limits. Kyoto�s very distinct and charming four seasons are due largely to its location in a basin. As such, you can see topographical lines that detail the mountain ranges circumscribing the city to the north, east, and west. The estimated 300 hours of work turned into not only a meditative experience, but also an in-depth study of Kyoto�s rich history. From founders of universities to destroyers of castles to preachers of Buddhism, history-altering figures left their mark on this city and this map. About Your Miyako Map You will receive a color 18 x 20 inch print of the Miyako Map. It is printed on Washi Kozo paper, which is made in Japan from Kozo fibers. The company that I have partnered with, Photo Innovation Lab, uses the Inkjet �Gicl�e� process - which provides archival quality and detailed image reproduction. The product will be shipped to you in a tube. Once you flatten out the map, we recommend that you frame it for your viewing pleasure and to ensure it remains undamaged. Send me an email and I will sign it with my signature and my Japanese crimson ink seal. Why Kickstarter The purpose of this Kickstarter is to raise funds to create high quality prints and get them into your hands. In the near future, I also hope to establish an online store to offer my work to other appreciators of cartography, lovers of Japan, and the people of Kyoto. I am currently working on a map of my neighborhood in Kyoto, known as Nishijin, as well as my own renditions of Berkeley (my old college town), Los Angeles (my birthplace), and Geneva (my future home for the next two years). With your support, I will have the means to manage my own website and design maps of new cities in the future. I even look forward to making maps of your requested cities someday. I hope to give the walls of your living space a map that is worthy of being the centerpiece."

In Book One (now available at www.TheForeignerComic.com,) Kaz grapples to make sense of Ravenika and its dangerous surroundings. He is smaller and much more frail than others, making him vulnerable prey in the eyes of the kings and queens who will stop at nothing to take advantage of him in order to get what they want. Fortunately for Kaz, he befriends a mysterious shepherdess, Natya, who becomes his protector. King Acedia who rules Vlangskaar (northern kingdom), is protected by his Royal Air Force. King Ira has Geranika (southern region) is backed by fiercely loyal half-breed comrades. Finally, King Superbia who reigns over Sorendahr, (the east), commands a terrifying robot zombie army. Ravenika - A once peaceful land now plagued with chaos and destruction. As The Last War begins, King Acedia�s Royal Air Force is defeated and the walls of his kingdom have fallen. King Ira clings to life after a vicious and unexpected attack by Natya. King Superbia is just beginning his masterful plan to turn his brothers against each other. What happens now? Will Kaz find a way home? Will Superbia win? Will peace ever return to Ravenika? The only way to find out is to back The Foreigner: The Last War Kickstarter campaign beginning June 12 and make Book Two a reality. Backers successfully rallied to breathe life into The Foreigner: Book One. I am so grateful for everyone who helped make Book One a successful reality. Thank you so much! I couldn�t have done it without you. Raising funds was challenging and a very rewarding experience--and this campaign is no different. I'm asking again for your support to make the exciting conclusion of The Foreigner saga a reality. My goal is to raise $8,000 to help cover the costs. Taylor Specialty Books (Texas, USA) is handling the printing of this 190-page graphic novel. They are a family-owned company that specializes in high-end coffee table books. They did a great job with The Foreigner: Book One and I aim to use them again for Book Two. As the chart below illustrates, the largest cost is printing and shipping the books. The remainder of the funds are allotted to help cover hired help, fees, and rewards. I've made many improvements since my first campaign with Book One. In addition to transitioning my work to 100 percent digital, I have asked industry professionals to help the creative process move more efficiently. I'm so pleased with my team of talented individuals which include a letterer, a flat colorist, a comic book copy editor, and a production layout artist. The script and art layouts for The Foreigner Book Two are done. Currently, about a third of the line art in Book Two is also complete. Check out these exciting new product rewards, stretch goals, and add-ons lined up for Book Two backers (including the option to get Book One to compliment Book Two.) Also, be sure to check out the first chapter of RISE (a miniseries detailing the origins of The Foreigner characters.) Stretch goals will include Vellum Stickers, and a mini sketchbook featuring the concept art from both books (a Kickstarter exclusive.) I will be posting updates about several product rewards throughout the summer as well as additional stretch goals. � UPDATE - AUTOMATIC BOOK MARKER AND UV SPOT LOGOS WHEN GOAL IS MET � +50.00 - 5 Set Character Sticker (5th sticker to be displayed August) This set features high quality 3 by 3 inch stickers featuring characters from The Foreigner. You get The Royal Air Force, King Ira, GARM, and NATYA. For all you coffee lovers, I'm also including a character called JAVA.

We've all heard the tales of incredible inventions and fabulous wealth coming out of Silicon Valley. But who is profiting the most from this? Is it the ingenious inventors? The savvy marketers? No - it's the venture capitalists who make the bets and reap the rewards! Now you too can enjoy the thrill of being a member of the 1% and gambling with your friends on what hot new startup will blow the competition out of the water and make you millions. Whether you're a baby boomer worried about your retirement funds, a millenial who's not even sure what ""investing"" means, an up and coming silicon valley entrepreneur who wants insight into the minds of the investors you're going to have to woo, or an actual VC who wants to unwind after a day of investing by pretending to invest, this is the game for you! Venture Capital is a complete game, ready to print and ship as soon as the campaign ends and your pledge goes through. Because the game is already in its final form, there are no stretch goals - you're definitely getting the complete experience! And because we're printing with the latest in Just-in-Time manufacturing technology, you will be able to print and ship your copy as soon as your pledge goes through. This is the same way we fulfilled Murder Most Foul and will fulfill the Enchiridion. DriveThruCards will then print your copy here in the USA and ship it directly to you. You'll pay for printing and shipping after the campaign, around $13-16 in the US. Venture Capital is a 15 minute bidding game for 2-6 players, with an additional solitaire mode. The game is played over 15 rounds: each round, all players bid on a given startup, and once all 15 startups have been acquired, the game ends. Whoever has built the most profitable portfolio is the winner! We also made a video of a complete game, though it turned out a bit blurry. Each player has a hand of 15 bidding cards, numbered 1-15, each of which will be played exactly once, representing the amount of money you're willing to invest in that startup - the startup founders will go with whoever offers them the most. The deck of 15 startup cards is shuffled, then the first startup is revealed. Each player selects a card from their hand to bid on it, places that face down, and when everyone has done so, the cards are flipped face up and the highest non-tied bid gets the startup. Then the next startup is revealed, and the game continues until all 15 startups have been bid on. Top, the backs of the other players' cards and the startup deck, middle, what your hand might look like a few rounds into the game, below, some startups Startups can have two attributes - a profit value (a number), and what industry they're in (Apps, Gadgets, or Services). Your score is the sum of the profits of all the startups in your portfolio, plus the Dominating the Industry bonus you get for each of the three industries. Count up how many startups you have in each industry, square it, and get that many bonus points! Most startups turn a profit and are in an industry, but there are also some which turn a profit but aren't in an industry, and some that are in two industries but don't turn a profit. The components of the game comprise 15 startup cards and 15 bidding cards for each of the six players, for a total of 105 cards, plus the rules and box. Examples of the various startups you can bid on And that's it! Simple to learn, tough to master, Venture Capital will have you coming back for more as soon as you finish your first game of it.

How will this be manufactured? This is our fourth game and fifth project here at Sixpence Games. Our first two games, Professor Pugnacious and Cultists of Cthulhu, were manufactured using a traditional offset printing process - which means they were made in China, it took several months to manufacture them, more months to ship them to the USA, and then yet more time to ship them out. While this meant access to bulk discounts, it also meant that the manufacturing process and cost were slow and subject to unpredictable delays and expenses - things like increased postage costs, upcoming tariffs on imports from China, etc. Starting with Murder Most Foul and continuing with The Enchiridion, we experimented with switching to using print-on-demand. This has several major advantages: it means that we can have a much shorter turnaround time for fulfillment (hence our promise to start fulfilling as soon as the campaign ends), it makes manufacturing and shipping costs much more predictable, it means we aren't subject to the new 25% tariff that just got enacted, it means that we won't run out of any given product, and it means manufacturing jobs here in America, and less pollution from transatlantic shipping. (you can go buy Murder Most Foul right now, whereas if you want a copy of Professor Pugnacious or Cultists of Cthulhu you'll need to hunt one down at a retail store). Of course, this process wouldn't work with a big box game with lots of components like Cultists of Cthulhu, and that's okay - constraints like that breed creativity, and we think you'll really like what we've come up with, and what we're going to come up with next. The process for fulfillment will be that, after the campaign, each backer will receive a unique code that they can use to have a copy of Venture Capital sent to their address. Shipping and printing will be calculated then, and you'll pay it after the campaign - about $13-16 altogether in the US. This means that the total cost will be about $30 for a shipped copy of Venture Capital (more if you live outside the US). You can think of it this way - the amount you pledge here on Kickstarter is what will go to pay the designer and artists, while the amount you pay afterwards goes to pay the manufacturer and postal service. Thank you for your support!"

The theme for the art show is: The Golden Age Hip Hop Art Expo (a free event, by the way) will consist of 30 digital and traditional art pieces celebrating the lives of female rap artists both the past and present. The concept and theme of the show is a marriage of true hip hop, and the Golden Age of Hollywood (the 1930s through the 1950s). It will have art pieces that will feature Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot, MC Lyte, and the like. The show will also have food, drinks, and entertainment; as well as a live auction segment.

Miniatures come unpainted. Altar Quest is a cooperative game of fantasy adventure inspired by the classic dungeon crawling board games that many of us grew up with. Using the Modular Deck System (MDS), introduced in Street Masters and Brook City, the game features incredibly modular gameplay using several different types of decks. Hero decks, threat decks, villain decks, and quest decks can all be mixed and matched along with altar cards, feature cards, and other game elements to create countless combinations of unique adventures. With an engaging one-off experience and narrative campaign play, Altar Quest offers players endless adventure in a unique fantasy setting with years of support planned for the game. Whether playing an individual quest or part of a campaign, each quest is made up of a combination of several different decks and other game elements. Heroes must complete the goal set out by the chosen quest deck in order to win the game. They must overcome several obstacles during the quest determined by the chosen threat deck and villain deck, as well as the deck of lurker cards. If any hero is defeated, the heroes lose the game. All Original Fantasy Setting Altar Quest takes place mainly in a realm called Aridika�a land of high fantasy and Gothic horror. As players dive deeper into the game, they�ll learn about the deep lore and many mysteries that hide within the shadows of Aridika and the world of Rhuna. Designers Adam & Brady Sadler have been developing the world of Rhuna since their early days of playing Dungeons & Dragons, and are excited to share it and expand it with Altar Quest. Altars The world of Rhuna was created by powers called �rhunes��godlike essences that came together to create all existence. Mortals were never intended to wield the untempered powers of rhunes, so they were crystallized deep within the earth to keep the lands above in balance. Unfortunately, evil finds a way, and deep below Aridika where the lich queen Szera slumbers, the rhunestones have been corrupted and forced to the surface. These altars are worshipped by power-hungry opportunists that use the rhunic energies surrounding them to further their own nefarious plans� During each quest, the chosen altar card will constantly affect the state of the altar pool. The altar pool is made up of 5 altar dice that are rolled at the start of the quest. Each altar die has 6 unique sides, each one containing a rhune symbol. These rhunes are used by the heroes, as well as the enemies, to trigger special effects. After an effect is triggered by a rhune symbol, the altar die showing that symbol is rolled and the new symbol is added to the altar pool. Players will have to balance using their rhune effects with making sure they aren�t empowering the enemy too much. Incredibly Modular Featuring the versatile Modular Deck System (MDS) that the Sadlers first introduced with Street Masters, the variability of Altar Quest is one of its key features. Players will have a world to explore by mixing hero decks, villain decks, threat decks, and quest decks with fluctuating feature decks to keep the environments fresh. Players can create their ideal game scenarios by matching up decks of their choice, or leave it to fate and embark on a randomized quest! Truly Solo, Truly Cooperative Altar Quest features an elegant player scaling solution built into the core design of the game, which means one player can play the game as easily as up to four, with no exceptions or special rules. Three Great Ways to Play While Altar Quest is designed to be a satisfying one-off adventure, players can also embark on an epic campaign by linking their quests together, earning upgraded cards for their decks, finding new equipment, and facing new challenges with enemy upgrades. Additionally, stories allow players to explore the vibrant setting of Aridika by playing through a story deck using the campaign rules. For more information on the add-ons, click here. Show your support for Altar Quest by donning one of many avatars available here: https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/altarquest Shipping Info Like our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping varies from region to region and doing so will allow us to provide more stretch goals for you during the campaign! Depending on what region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates and costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional buys you get. USA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. CANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. LATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below). ASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries. OCEANIA: $25-$35 to Australia and New Zealand. AFRICA: $95 to most countries. EUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries (see below). � $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. � $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. � $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. Unfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia. If your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter. THE LOOMING TARIFFS: We have spoken to our factory and shipping logistic reps and until anything officially changes, nothing will change or affect us cost-wise. If things do start having a financial impact, Blacklist Games, LLC will be absorbing what we can, so we can keep overall costs and shipping as familiar to what you're normally used to with our campaigns. If there are any increases at all, it will be minimal and only be set by any fulfillment costs outside of our control, since we do not intend to randomly up-charge our products for the sake of doing so. POST PLEDGE MANAGER NOTICE: Any pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs since it would be out of our normal fulfillment cycle. For non-US backers that will likely incur import taxes as well. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package and the risk of the package being bounced back to us. Refund Policy We can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign�s end date, fees included. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them) up until our pledge manager is closed. At that point, refunds will no longer be possible. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed."

The need to stimulate creativity among kids is at an all-time high because funding for arts education is at an all-time low. With cutbacks in arts education in schools, kids are not getting the opportunity to reap the many benefits offered by the creative arts, including greater confidence, focus and problem-solving skills. Sample Page This journal helps fill the gap by encouraging kids to express themselves artistically and using the written word. Here is what the research says: Americans for the Arts reports that art education is known to improve fine and gross motor skills, as well as the ability to focus, make decisions, take risks, persevere and generate a strong sense of self-confidence and resilience. The American Art Therapy Association says the creative process improves and enhances physical, mental and emotional well-being. So much so that speech therapists frequently borrow from their art therapy colleagues to assist children in strengthening their verbal expression. (Check out Speech Buddy for more on this.) PBS Parents, citing the same Americans for the Arts survey, states that �young people who participate regularly in the arts. � are four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement, to participate in a math and science fair or to win an award for writing an essay or poem than children who do not participate.� Parents also receive value from their child's experience with Drip, Drop & Drizzle: The potential for even better lines of communication between you and your child, as a result of children being encouraged to express themselves about difficult topics. A memento of your child�s younger years, which you can then gift to him or her as they grow into adulthood. Quality time for your child away from digital screens and devices. Whether you actively engage in the journal together, or simply share quiet time as your child works in Drip, Drop & Drizzle and you read your favorite book, you're sure to both be enriched. Sample Page ABOUT ME My name is Mary Ostrowski. I�ve been an educator in both public and private schools in the United States and abroad for 18 years. I�ve worked in teaching and administrative positions with hundreds of students. Children of all ages tend to call me Ms Mary, and most know I love hugs! In addition to teaching children, I have mentored many teachers and supported even more parents through the joys and challenges of their children�s development. Today I own a small super cute preschool (you saw some of my students in the video above), write children's books, and am also in the process of developing a series of creativity workshops. This journal is a culmination of all I love about being an educator, an advocate for children, and a kid at heart myself. After all, speaking our truth and using our own unique voices is a lifelong journey. Why not help our kids embark on this journey as early as possible? This is the foundation of Drip, Drop & Drizzle. BEYOND THE BOOK Drip, Drop & Drizzle is just a beginning. Once published, it will form the centerpiece for a larger educational effort offered through my practice, Healthy Equation. Small and large group workshops bridging the gap between communication, social emotional growth and academic learning in creative writing will be designed in variation for: children groups parent groups groups of children and parents together Visit my website www.healthyequation.com to learn more.

The exhibition, Environmental Impact 2, showcases contemporary artwork to hopefully raise awareness and spur action on the disastrous effects of global warming and mass species' extinction. We need climate-aware art not only to make the case for our peril, but to motivate action at all levels. The shipping crates alone will cost over $700. I also plan to travel to Asheville, North Carolina, the second stop on the exhibition tour. In Asheville, I'm seeking to arrange a gallery show of related work and set up a lecture at a local college or university, in which I'll share an extensive presentation on contemporary artistic responses to climate change. Please consider helping and forwarding this to others who might!"

THE PRIDE BIRD PROJECT IS FUNDED!!! Thank you all SO much for your contributions and pledges!!! I have always wanted to make these cute little pins to celebrate who we are, and it was YOU who let me live that dream!! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!!!! HOORAY!!!!! Let's keep it up until 12 AM on July 4!!! Let your colors soar!  Yo, my name is Astral! I'm a game design & illustration student from Florida who loves to make little goodies with my works!  About two years ago, I came to the conclusion that I was bisexual. It wasn't until April of 2019 did I come out to my immediate family, which took immense amounts of emotional strength. My life had been nothing but endless anxiety over the topic, until I heard with my own two ears that my family were accepting of me. To this day, I still can't believe I came out. I did it! Because of this milestone in my life, this June of 2019 is my first pride month out of the closet!! To celebrate this, all the wonderful folk I've befriended in the LGBTQA+ community, and all the closeted people hoping to someday find peace and strength, I decided to try my first ever enamel pins: Pride Birds! I have always adored birds, and they've become my symbol on the web! So, of course, I decided to mix my identity with my favorite thing. Enjoy these prideful birbs! Remember, you're loved and amazing, no matter your gender or sexuality! Even if you're not ready to take flight today, the sky will always be there for you. You're part of the flock! Not the writing utensils, or the feathers shiny and cute!  The Pride Birds enamel pins will be 1.5 inches/38 mm. They will all be hard enamel (flat), with varying plating dependent on the design. They will have one rubber clutch and come with a backing card. If funds allow, they will also be backstamped! Ooooh Aaaaah  Introducing the backer cards! Each lil birdie will come with their own little backer, to keep them safe and in the spirit! Each card is 3.5"" by 2"" matte cardstock! Let's get this bread(crumbs)!  Our first 4 designs are Gay Wren, Lesbian Pigeon, Transgender Chickadee, and Bisexual Budgie! These pins will be unlocked upon complete funding of the kickstarter!  Next we have Pansexual Finch and Asexual Parrot! These pin designs will be unlocked at $3000! All or Nothing  Next we have Non-Binary Hummingbird and Aromantic Crow!

Luna Foto // Karen Garrett de Luna OUT WITH A BANG Behold, Buttcracker V...the last thrust! For the past five years, Buttcracker performances have brought hair metal, modern dance, and sold-out crowds together. And even though we always say �this year could be the final year,� well, this time, it actually is. In 2019, we're bringing new moves, old favorites, special guest performers, and all the glory of '80s rock n' roll one last time! We want to end this crazy Butt ride with a bang! BUT, and it's a big butt, before we can capture the Christmas spirit and regurgitate it back to you with reckless abandon, we need your help. Today, we're asking for $3,000 to help �take it to 11�! Images from Buttcracker IV...the Final Countdown! in December 2018. Photos by Casey Gainor and Jim Coleman After all, The Dingle Fairy needs a new dance belt. The fireplace needs wood. Santa�s chaps need replacing. The Ragdolls need their stockings filled, and we are in dire need of more �snow.� Your generous donation will pay for: Compensation for 20 professional dancers and crew. Renting Erickson Theater on Capitol Hill for TWO glorious weekends (Dec. 13, 14, 15 & 19, 20, 21, 22) In addition to: Fake fur Leather Glitter Spandex Whips Chains ...and much more! WHERE IT ALL BEGAN Producers Diana Cardiff, Jana Hill, Sara Jinks, and Matt Mulkerin created Buttcracker in December, 2015 � reviving the spirit of their wildly successful Buttrock Suites. This modern-dance performance series reached a fever pitch in the early 2000s. In 2005, The Seattle Weekly described Buttrock as �a hilarious-yet-heartfelt performance that will entrance both metalheads and fans of modern dance.� The Stranger�s David Schmader described the buttrock/modern-dance phenomenon this way: �Watching such physically eloquent, conceptually engaged dancers navigate the crude-by-design crunch of hard rock is a ridiculous thrill.� With well-known Seattle choreographers such as Alex Martin, Juliet Waller Pruzan, Crispin Spaeth, and the Buttrcracker producers, these shows consistently sold out Velocity, Bumbershoot, Neumos, and Triple Door, to name a few. A throwback pic of ""Buttrock Suites"" by Michael Doucett BACK TO THE MAIN POINT We know you love Buttcracker � the energy, the booze, the utter silliness. We love it, too. As SeattleDances wrote of our performance, ""The spirit of the rock concert was alive and well ... this show may have been a tribute to sex, drugs, and rock �n roll, but it also successfully captured the communal spirit of the holiday season."" So let's do it again. One last time. Let's bring back the performer/audience catharsis, the head-banging, and the holiday cheer with a twist that is... Buttcracker! Buttcracker images by Roy Anderson, Lance Mercer and Jim Coleman THE PRODUCERS Diana Cardiff is a critically acclaimed performer and choreographer from Seattle, Washington. She has created, produced, and performed in an original production called the Buttrock Suites since its inception in 2003. With Buttrock Suites, she was able to successfully express her flair for the dramatic. Diana was a founding member of d9 Dance Collective (1992-2004), has also been a member and collaborator with the Pat Graney Dance Company and Wade Madsen and Dancers. She toured nationally with the Pat Graney Dance Company and has set work for Ian Bell�s Brown Derby Series at Rebar, Teatro Zinzanni, Seattle Repertory Theater, LiveGirls! Theater, various musicals, etc. She has a BFA from Cornish College of the Arts. Sara Jinks has produced and co-produced work at the Merc Playhouse Theatre and with Methow Arts Alliance in the Methow Valley. She also produced Ten Tiny Dances in Seattle and Twisp in 2015 and will bring a new Ten Tiny to On the Boards this fall. Sara is the Production Manager to acclaimed choreographers Heather Kravas and Jody Kuehner/Cherdonna Shinatra. As a performing artist, Sara was a member of Pat Graney Company from 2000-2018 and danced extensively with Crispin Spaeth Dance Group and d9 Dance Collective. Jana Hill earned her professional dancing chops as a member of Mid America Dance Company (MADCO) in St. Louis, Mo. As a member of the company she performed, did assistant choreography and was rehearsal director for their annual holiday spoof �The MadCracker�.This irreverent take on the Nutcracker; brilliantly conceived by Ross Winter, with original music by Michael F. Hunt, was a huge influence on her creativity and choreography. Upon moving to Seattle became was a founding member of Rockhopper Dance and Buttrock Suites. When she�s not dancing, Jana enjoys making pretty gardens. And she also tries to wrangle to crazy genius of Matty. Matt Mulkerin started his dance career at the ripe old age of 21, after deciding degrees in Japanese and International Business were less financially lucrative in the real world. Matt has had the opportunity to dance in a whole bunch of places with a whole bunch of great people in his career, during which he performed with the Mid America Dance Company, and was a co-founder of both Rockhopper Dance and the Buttrock Suites. His largest audience to date (5,000 + people) was at the Walla Walla hot air ""Balloon Stampede"" in 1991, during which his performance was interrupted by an emergency evacuation due to a major gas leak that threatened to blow the venue up. He is very grateful for this, as it taught him to never take choreography too seriously, as you may just end up getting blown up. In addition to the four producers, Buttcracker will include performances by young whipper-snappers, as well as guest and VIP performers. Performers include: Richard Ayres, Becca Blackwell, Karen Garrett De Luna, Christopher Engelbrecht, Amy J Lambert, Ken Jarvey and Sarah Paul Ocampo.

About the Kickstarter Hi! I'm Rosi, an artist with a presence across Tumblr & Instagram & Twitter. This is my third Kickstarter riding off the success of my second. You can find the pins from my previous Kickstarter here or see examples at the end of this page. For my last Kickstarter, I only expected to unlock four designs at most and we reached twenty-two! I was not fully prepared for that success, so this time around I made sure I wouldn't be rushing to add stretch goals if we make them. I apologize if all the designs listed overwhelm you! Give them all a look and make sure to pick your best girl . Defined by Courage is a collection of pins inspired by more of the super-heroines we know and love. I hope you will welcome them with open arms. Funding covers the cost of producing the pins, backing cards, packaging, and Kickstarter fees.

Whether you live to work or work to live, it's important not to lose yourself in all of the hustle and bustle. But sometimes you lose yourself anyway. Maybe you need a helping hand to find your way again. Maybe all you need is a small reminder that you're on the right path. These pins were made for anybody and everybody. Inspired by the compass, True North is a collection of stained glass pins adorned with elegant (but playful) hard enamel motifs. Commonly used in places of refuge and sanctuary, my hope is that the stained glass can remind you that you're still safe, even when you feel lost. I am very fortunate to be able to collaborate with the wonderful, the creative and the lovely Scribbles_With_Faces! It has been a pleasure to work with her to design these pins and I would be so happy to be able to make more beautiful things with her! Why Kickstarter? This project, as a concept, just felt right for a Kickstarter. Filled with positive and encouraging reminders to help guide their bearers through the day, it gave me goosebumps thinking about how wonderful it would be to see a project like this supported by a group of people instead of one. I simply didn't want to take credit for this by myself. And so, whenever someone wears one of these pins, it is my greatest joy to have them know that not one, but many people are by their side through good and bad times. Where To Next? Below you'll find everything you need to know about this project. It's been a big focus of mine to present you with a simple and straightforward experience. Feel free to browse through these beautiful concepts and read about the intentions behind each. I've set up a simple system for ""Unlocking"" the entire set. I hope you'll join me in bringing these wonderful and encouraging motifs to life. Rise And Shine Rise and Shine! Now is the very best time to make your move. Even though getting started can be difficult, just think of the sun and everything will become clear to you. Its warmth will comfort you even after the coldest nights and its light will lead you through the darkest of times. Gold plated with sky-blue stained glass, this pin features a gold bordered hard enamel sun motif. The bottom part of the sun is gold as well, expressing the brightness of the sun reflecting on water. Afternoon Bloom Stay strong and be vigilant! From dawn until dusk the sunflower stands at attention, following the sun wherever it goes. They grow tall, stand strong and find courage to persist day after day. Believe in yourself, the strength of the sunflower is in each and all of us. Gold plated with blue stained glass, this pin features a gold-bordered hard enamel sunflower motif with gold floral accents. A wonderful pin to celebrate the harmony between boldness and elegance. Lucent Night Whether you have arrived at your destination or must continue your journey tomorrow, rest easy. The guardians of the night stand watch so that you can rest peacefully. For those of you whose journeys take you into the night, may the beacon be a reminder of where there will always be safe passage. Regardless of where you find yourself, may the moon and stars remind you of your direction. Even when you find yourself surrounded by darkness. Silver plated with grey stained glass, this pin features a silver bordered hard enamel motif of a lighthouse amidst turbulent waters. In the sky you can see the moon and stars on their orbits, symbolizing certainty in the midst of the uncertain. Noonday Loftiness There will be times when even the best of us loses hope. Our dreams, our ambitions...everything seems to deflate right before our eyes. The hot-air balloon flies against all odds. Though deflated just moments ago, it serves as a reminder to find your fire and rise despite the challenges you may face. The only way from here is up! May the weight on your shoulders be lessened by the loftiness of your dreams. Rose Gold plated, this pin is a beautiful departure from the previous ones: the border, the sun and the flame of the basket pit are warm yellow stained glass. The clouds extend beyond the borders, symbolizing our hope for you. May you rise with lofty thoughts and expand beyond your perceived horizons. Nightfall Narrative As the day comes to a close and the sun makes its way beyond the horizon, your haven awaits you with a warm welcome home. This is the perfect time to reflect and recover from your day. Cozy up with your favorite book, light some candles or just enjoy the beauty of the evening sky. Whatever you choose, be sure to remember and care for yourself. May you find your peace daily, and it give way to rest, recovery and warm memories. This rose gold plated pin features a vibrant sun displaying a gradient of orange which symbolizes the range of emotions a person can feel at the end of the day. The book serves to remind everyone to reflect and recover from the day. In the dimming sunlight of the evening hours, we also see a lantern. Warm, comforting light emanates from it, reminding us that we don't need to focus on more than we have to right now. Backed by a lush purple, often seen in the evening sky, the border, the small rays and the space of the lantern surrounding the flame is an ochre colored stained glass. When the dust settles at the ends of our days, we're left to sort through the range of things we experienced therein. Whatever it is that we face in ourselves, there's no need to let the worries we bear go with us into sleep. Take time to care for yourself, and approach the night with peace of mind.

As a lover of life, I believe that all children deserve to lead a happy and healthy life. I love words. I love books. I love self-empowerment. I love the intricacies of managing an everyday life and inspiring others. I am raising money for an exciting and engaging children�s books series for second and third grade students. The books will provide an understanding of everyday events, promote healthy living and provide lesson plans and standardized curriculum for overworked school teachers. This unique approach to learning turns everyday life experience into a learning opportunity that helps to build self esteem, self image and an understanding of the value in appreciating differences. While the stories are fictional they are based on real life events and the imagination and curiosity of my seven year old granddaughter, Kenzie and her friends. The world is changing and it�s important to develop children that are flexible, healthy and open minded. It�s equally important to support, develop and retain talented teachers. Providing lesson plans and curriculum based on common core standards and 21st century skills will help to simplify the teaching process, streamline and create efficiencies in the planning precess without sacrificing academic success. I�ve been working with kids since 1995. I have mentored kids at several schools in the greater Hartford area and Atlanta, GA, developed curriculum for the Wilson Gray YMCA 7th grade entrepreneur program and implemented a youth mentoring program at Fred D. Wish elementary school in Hartford, CT. My love and commitment for today�s youth inspires me to create reading materials that will promote a healthy mind, healthy lifestyle and helps to develop an appreciation for differences. Besides writing� I spent 20 years as a leader and executive in Corporate America devoting my time to helping consumers understand and plan for a secure retirement. After going through numerous re-organizations, I decided to follow my dreams to help today�s youth. My bachelor�s degree is in Business Administration, and I received my graduate degree in Organization Leadership from Quinnipiac University in CT."

Billions of gentle animals are senselessly tortured and slaughtered yearly for the wool, leather, suede, angora, cashmere and sheepskins consumers demand. Shop Vegan Style was created to bring clean materials to the forefront of consumer choice; rather than a sidelined alternative. Most designers and manufacturers are not aware that the animals used are crippled and defenseless in small cages waiting for death. Just as sweat shops became an issue of global importance, now the world must face the horrors of the animal cruelty industry. Vegan leathers today are indistinguishable from animal leather. Textiles have come a long way. Wool, down, angora, and cashmere also have clean alternatives that do not involve tearing the hair from the animal's body, maiming it into passivity; or killing and skinning it while the heart is still beating. Shop Vegan Style is a global retail marketplace of cruelty free fashion and furniture for the salvation of animals and the environment. With 50 participating affiliate retail partners and brands in USA, Canada, Europe, and Asia; and websites in development for France and Asia, it is a global mission to influence consumers to choose cruelty free fashion with compassion. The Kickstarter Campaign beginning Early June 2019 is to raise much needed funds for domains and webhosting up for renewal, and the development of a vegan women's handbag line under the label: Vegan Style Collection. Depending upon the success of the fundraising efforts, additional vegan fashion collections for men and women will follow. Enjoy the prestige of being a 2019/2020 Sponsor of the future of fashion.

Now, relax your gums that protect your teeth. Gum care is as important as tooth brushing. Catch both of them with additional teeth whitening. Vumblr is world�s first Vacuum Gum Stimulator that massages entire gums at once with teeth cleaning and whitening effect. Vumblr Features: Vacuum Control Technology Ergonomic Mouthpiece Foam toothpaste with Hydroxyapatite Don't worry about choking or gagging, the mouthpiece is made with soft silicone for medical use. Gingivitis and periodontal disease, which are the second most common disease after cold, can be prevented sufficiently through simple gum massage. Gum massages provide a couple of benefits that make gum disease treatment more effective. Massaging your oral soft tissue increases blood flow to the area, allowing that tissue to repair itself more effectively. As a result, your gums will be less susceptible to the harmful effects of gingivitis and periodontitis. Periodontal disease (periodontitis) has long been known as the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. But the damage isn�t confined to the mouth. Gum disease has also been associated with an increased risk of serious degenerative diseases. Over the years, people with perio-dontal disease have been found to be at higher risk for cardiovascular dis-ease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, pregnancy complications, and dementia. Moreover, the association probably works both ways. For example, diabetes research has determined that successfully treating periodontitis reduces the severity of diabetes and vice versa. In recognition of its potentials from the experts, Vumblr is confirmed to participate in following international exhibitions. Take the opportunity to purchase products recognized by many dentists for the first time. We�re ready to meet interested buyers from all over the world and let more people know about our products. Vumblr creates painless vacuum pressure inside the mouth using a mouthpiece with over 300 bristles to clean, whiten, and massage your teeth and gums. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 You control the vacuum pressure simply with your finger. Just cover and open the air release hole to expand and contract the mouthpiece as desired for a squeaky clean mouth! Normal Gum Stimulator VS ""Vumblr"" There are 30 inter-dental spaces, which are spaces in between the teeth of upper and lower dental arch, and these spaces are critical part to gum health. As the mouthpiece contracts, Vumblr mouthpiece has a same effect as using 30 gum stimulators at the same time. As the number of contraction increases, the effect increases 30 times. Moreover, the mouthpiece not only massages the inter-dental spaces but also massages the entire gums. Watch the power of the Vumblr in action! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 1. One Size Fits All! One size fit mouthpiece, Vumblr has a stretchable structure for stronger expansion and contraction. You can choose the size of the mouthpieces if you back us with Family for 2 or Family for 4. Vumblr basic includes one mouthpiece for Adult. 2. Flexible Structure for Dynamic Movement The mouthpiece delivers an invigorating and evenly distributed massage, increasing blood circulation which is essential for gum health. A thin wing structure is added to the mouthpiece to stick to the Mucogingival Junction to form vacuum pressure. 3. Specialized Cleaning Bristles The Vumblr brush was designed to increase the friction of the brush as much as possible and as a result scrubs the surface of the teeth to remove food debris and dental plaque. 4. Convenient Mouthpiece Storage Clean, protective storage for your mouthpiece where ever you take your Vumblr. It can be crumpled into a smaller space thanks to its thin and elastic structure. Vumblr's proprietary foam toothpaste is infused with nano-sized cleaning particles, natural ingredients including Hydroxyapatite. 1) Teeth cleaning - Nano-sized micro foam particles help specially designed brushes to clean the teeth. 2) Gum Care - Sterilization and anti-inflammatory function of natural plant material (Cnidium officinale Makino & mugwort) helps improve gum health. 3) Teeth Whitening - Since Hydroxyapatite , which has proven whitening effect, is included, if used continuously, it can whiten teeth without tooth hypersensitivity. For the perfect vacuum control and to avoid pain in the gums while vacuum pressure is established, the mouthpiece is designed to take the Mucogingival Junction into consideration and applies Neutral Zone Theory which is used in dental clinics to produce dentures and braces. Neutral Zone is that area where the forces of tongue pressing outward are neutralized by the forces of the cheeks and lips pressing inward. To avoid pain in the gums while vacuum pressure is established, the mouthpiece is designed by considering the anatomic structure, the Mucogingival Junction. Vumblr provides state-of-the-art teeth cleaning and gum massage effects based on AWARD-WINNING vacuum control technology. A dentist with 20 years experience, Dr. Hyun found that many patients remove plaque poorly because they lack adequate manual dexterity to manipulate the toothbrush. He also found that patients suffering from systemic complications such as aspiration pneumonia or dental disease due to poor oral hygiene have higher death rates. He was determined to find a solution to this problem. So in 2014, he worked together with enthusiastic engineers and developed an oral care device that automatically cleans teeth and massages gum with an application of vacuum pressure. Academic Activities After completion of the final prototype, and in various academic presentations, our team was recognized by experts and dentists for the effectiveness of the Vumblr Oral Care Device. Over the past 3 years, we have upgraded through 8 prototypes, researching, testing and refining the functionality and performance of this innovative oral care system. Our R&D team has spent years developing and perfecting Vumblr, finding the best materials and formulas to optimize the oral care experience. We're so confident in our products we back it with a 1-year warranty. We promise to deliver within four months of our campaign completion. We are confident in our team, our product, and our manufacturing schedule. We understand that some of you may be concerned because of the non-delivery history of companies and products that have come before us on Kickstarter.

My name is John Vash and I create unique objects primarily from wood and stained glass. In this project I'm creating wood table lamps with interchangeable stained glass panels. The glass panels may be easily changed without tools and can completely alter the mood of a room. The lamps are 13 inches tall by 6 1/2 inches square and are made of American walnut. I use a pre-wired UL listed cord set with an inline switch. Each lamp includes an 800 lumen LED bulb. NEW - see new add-ons below. Get a second set of glass or even a second lamp at a special price. Even though each lamp reward says delivery will be March, 2020, the first eight lamps that are chosen will be delivered in September, 2019. And since the glass choices are limited choose your lamp early. Glass choices: The lamps are available in 18 different colors of stained glass. The quantities of each reward are limited to glass I already have or am certain I can get. Stained glass is challenging to photograph especially when backlit. I've made every effort to represent the glass colors as accurately as possible. Glass choices - each color is a different reward The development of this project: I spent three months designing and building prototypes before I got the size and proportions of the lamp just right. I also wanted to create a design where the glass could be changed without tools. This feature created challenges in how the wood is cut and routed. I then surface planed the wood to 3/4 inch thickness and cut all the pieces for the first eight lamps. That was just the beginning of the work that goes into each lamp. The next step involved 27 drill press operations and 41 router table operations before assembly could begin. These steps aren't obvious in the finished lamps but were necessary for the features I desired. Here are a few pictures of the lamp with different stained glass panels.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Goal: My goal was to create a simple, elegant table lamp that would accommodate glass of different thicknesses, fully support the glass with minimal shadows, and allow the glass panels to be easily changed without tools. I believe I have achieved these goals. Delivery schedule: The lamps will be delivered in the order they were chosen by backers. Even though the rewards say the lamps will be delivered in March, 2020, I will deliver the first eight lamps in September, 2019. The remaining lamps will be delivered in groups of eight in three month intervals. NEW - Add-ons: Get a second set of stained glass panels for only $10 ($40 value). For backers that choose the table lamp reward, simply add $10 to your pledge and when the project ends you can choose your second set of panels from the available color choices. Since the color choices are limited they will be offered to backers in the order the rewards were chosen. This add-on is only available to backers who have chosen the table lamp reward. NEW - More add-ons: These lamps look great in pairs so get a second lamp for only $150. Simply add $150 to your pledge and when the project ends you can choose the glass color for your second lamp. It can be the same color glass as your first lamp or a different color. You can also add a second set of glass for your second lamp for an additional $10. Here's a summary of the add-on amounts: Other rewards: I am also offering two rewards at a lower pledge level than the lamps. These include a clear textured glass candle holder and a claro walnut desk clock. Candle holder Claro walnut clock Delivery schedule for these rewards: All of the candle holders and clocks will be delivered in September, 2019."

It has been an absolute game changer for the industry of backpacks. Pix Backpack has been reviewed by top YouTube bloggers and featured on dozens of media. Everyone loved our product and we received great feedback. However, many backers have continuously asked for the same kind of backpack, only for kids. We made it happen and hope you'll love it as much as we do! Pix Mini vs. Usual Backpack Pix Mini Draw right on your backpack. The integrated in-app image editor allows you to create animations and display them on the ambient screen of the backpack. Each little box on the app corresponds to a specific pixel which can be adjusted in terms of color so that you can make up your own pixel art. The only limit is your imagination! Kids can also share animations with their friends. Simply hit the SHARE button and exchange your pixel art with other Pix Mini owners. The animation will appear on your friend�s backpack within a matter of seconds. Shine together with your friends! Make friends with Pix Mini Pix Mini is the first backpack that helps you socialize. By displaying self-made artworks on the backpack, your child can communicate his personal interests to his peers. It is a great way to find friends and express your individuality. Make your kid known as ""that kid with the cool tech backpack!"" Develop your child's thinking The Pix Mini app offers brain-stimulating games designed to test memory and cognitive capabilities of your child. When you play on your backpack, logical thinking turns into an interactive activity. Simply press controllers on your phone device and treat your backpack as the playing screen. Make your child safer The glowing animation will make your child clearly visible on the road. The geolocation feature will allow parents to see their kids on the map. Additionally, there is an alarm function that goes off whenever a child moves too far away from the backpack. Pix Mini is controlled from a free Pix app that can be installed on any iOS/Android smartphone device. The user-friendly interface enables your child to effectively operate the backpack and apply all of the functionalities with ease. Watch this short video that demonstrates how to use it: It is still a backpack! In addition to the cool features of Pix Mini, it is still a practical backpack that enables your kid to carry all of the school essentials. The trendy design of the backpack will highlight your kid�s style and maintain his confidence on every single walk to school. How to pack your Pix Mini Pix Mini is a convenient backpack that could be also worn casually and sustain an active lifestyle of a kid. Moreover, it could be easily worn in the event of rain or snow, as the ambient screen stays resistant to low temperature and water splashes. Timeline The Pix Story Pix is a consumer electronics startup with a young team of professionals who believe that users should be both the creators and innovators of the product. That�s why, less than a year ago, we released the first smart backpack for adults. The product has been a major success as we managed to hit the total funding of $338,000 on both Indiegogo & Kickstarter. However, after receiving numerous requests to also make one for children, we made a smaller, lighter backpack with a whole bundle of cool perks relevant for kids. That�s how we ended up with Pix Mini. The Pix Philosophy Pix connects portability with the creativity. Our mission is to make people happy while they�re on the go. All people are different and have a common need to express their personality through their looks. That�s why we give it to our consumers and let them to decide what they want to wear. We believe that personal looks should reflect our personality and serve as a way to communicate our views to the world. That�s why we strive our excellence to make the most customizable backpacks ever made. Our Team Social Network Links We know that not everyone will be able to afford Pix Mini. So even if you can�t donate a dollar or make a purchase, you can still help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of. We rely on all of our Pix fans! As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.

I started writing this thing back in November 2016, I spent 2017 working with a band to finish the songs and then demoing them out. In the beginning of 2018 we started recording the songs and finished up sometime over the summer. In November 2018, two years after I started writing, I got my final mixes for the record back. January 2019 I got my masters sent to me from the world renowned Blasting Room in Fort Collins Colorado. Since then I've been working double shifts, planning tours (including a trip to England to play a festival), finishing artwork with my amazing graphic designer, planning a PR campaign, planning a music video shoot, preparing for vinyl pressing, paying for said vinyl pressing, working on putting merchandise together, setting the album up for worldwide digital distribution, building my own website, booking local shows, promoting local shows, playing local shows, and practicing for my upcoming tours. Making an album isn't cheap or easy, especially if it's self funded. On June 30th 2019 my PR campaign kicks off for two months to lead up to the release of my album on August 31st through my own record label Travel Well Records, and along side another local label, Stars at Night, and German record label, Ring of Fire Records; but before I can kick off that campaign, I still have a lot to get done. 90 percent of this release and all the things that come with it have been paid for, by me (with some help from friends), simply from working myself into the ground, sacrificing my social life, selling my car and being as frugal as possible. This last 10 percent is where crowdfunding comes in. There are few things left on my check list; like shooting a music video, paying for shipping for my vinyl, building a stock pile of merchandise to sell on tour, traveling through the mid-west in July to promote the upcoming album, traveling to England at the end of that tour to play Rebellion Fest and promote the upcoming album, printing CDS, promoting the release, and if funds exceed expectations, maybe I'll be able to upgrade my gear, my guitar has taken a beaten over the years... I have a good part of the funds for this last bit saved, but I'm looking for a little help for this final push. Thank you so much for reading and contributing. Let's do this! For all interested parties, I've made a single track available for streaming so you have an idea of what you're supporting.

The basic design is expanded to accommodate the actual final PCB printed circuit board and IC integrated circuit chip.

Each of us have different ways to soothe our minds, hearts and bodies. Here, we have one simple way to release your stress. that can be used as a huge squishy, plush cushion and hug & Lean pillow. Good quality relaxation has become a luxury that many cannot seem to afford. It's a FACT that we need to release our stress to be healthy and function properly. People want to touch the soft like squishies and slimes because it solves the lack of sensual desires in society. It relieves anxiety throughout the daily life and feels satisfies with the touch of them. Although the culture has becoming diversified, the most basic sense is not satisfied to many people. Playing with objects such as slime gives people a relaxing sensation that relieves stress. Feel the Cloud! Cloud nine is safe & functional in its healthy & comfy way! Memory foam or EPS Styrofoam has an unpleasant smell and is unhealthy. If the beads leak out, they can be inhaled and Memory foam releases dangerous VOC gas. Squishies and Slime also have a dangerous amount of chemicals that are hazardous to your health. CL9 Removed The Chemical Harm but keeps the TOUCH. Special 100% polyester gel fiber The result of using a Siliconized Micro Denier 100% Polyester Gel Fiber is the most smart and high quality down-alternative cushion. Siliconized polyester filler is a type of filler created from synthetic fiber, polyester, which is treated with a silicate material. This silicone coating adds a feather-like touch to the fill, which makes it very slippery, soft and easy to work with. The siliconized process also makes the fiber resistant to bacteria, non-allergenic. Polyester Fiberfill 15 Denier is an extra-comfortable polyester stuffing with a slick finish to prevent bunching. This thin microfiber can fit more inside the cushion and provide maximum comfort. Silicon coating makes CL9 cushion water-repellent, so it's machine washable. It is not easily scattered and clumped. The filling may tangle up in laundering a little bit, but can be smoothed back out with your hand because the length of the fiber is short. Small squishy is the perfect size to play with. You can use it as an indoor playing ball. Medium size cushion is just right to hug and hold onto. Use it when you take a nap or just to rest on. The Jumbo ball is ideal for using as body pillow. It is huggable, leanable, and seatable. Just sink into it gives you the feeling that you are floating on the clouds. CL9 Jumbo Cushion Outdoor Cover For your comfort, we added a weather-resistant outdoor cover. Cloud Nine outdoor cover protects from scratches, dusts, and water. You can bring it to the pool, backyard, and anywhere! STRETCH GOAL!! (not available for Face & Arm pillow) CL9 has a very unique smooth, gummy & squishy feeling.You can hug it, lean on it, sink into it and use it as a cushion or pillow for any occasion. Care Instruction Care: Machine wash on gentle cycle in cold water with mild detergent. Tumble dry set on low heat setting or air dry. Add dryer balls to keep it fluffy. Reshape the cushion with your hands after it is dried to return to its original shape. CL9 all fabrics and fillings are machine washable, but depends on the size of your washing machine, we recommend washing the cover only for the jumbo cushion. Note: Items are compressed for shipping. We recommend opening as soon as possible. Compressed filling takes up to a day to regain its original size and shape. project collaborated with ideapot I frequently sacrifice my sleep in order to balance my work and family. I was always so tired that I would take a nap anywhere and anytime I had the chance. I couldn�t find a cushion or pillow that allowed me to release the stress and get the most comfortable rest. One day, my daughter was playing with slime and said she wants to touch it all day long even when she goes to bed because she liked that gummy feeling. However, I couldn�t let her play with the slime since the ingredients of the slime like boric-acid and sodium-borate include harmful chemicals. my daughter loves to play with slime! I decided to create a soft but stretchy, and safe feeling �slime-like stress ball� so that everyone can use it. Well, it was NOT EASY. Choosing a perfect fabric for soft and gummy feeling, with hypo-allergenic (because my daughter has very sensitive skin), should be easy to wash but does not get stuffy. We had a hard time communicating with factories while we choose the perfect fabric, and the GIANT package shipping was a challenge. But ultimately, our final CL9 cushion is born! The final CL9 cushion is made with stretchy spandex + soft velvet fabric. Soft and stretchy cover helps you to stretch and shape cushion easier. The Short cut microfiber filling makes you more comfortable and relaxed. We are happy to introduce CL9 cushion set to many of you through Kickstarter, and looking forward to launch more awesome projects. Share our project with your family and friends and we will give you 15% of every dollar you helped to raise!"

If you love Ethnic Diversity and Independent Creations you will want to be at this event. If you are a creator or want to ask about how to create for the comic book industry you have to attend this event! This is for the small guys and women that never had a chance to show their true colors and talent. The big comic book companies would love to see this event fail because the stories and characters that will be shown here are from true creators that have purpose. Its time for the Independent creators to band together, rise, and take the comic book, fantasy, and sci-fi entertainment industry into a new direction! This is mainly an early kickoff campaign to help people to be aware of this event. Supporting this kickstarter will also help pay for the facility that the venue is being held, and it will assist in paying for the guests travel expenses. The event will carry on regardless. If you come to this event and spread the word about the importance of what Black Label ComiCon is all about, THANK YOU! For those still sitting on the sidelines, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET INVOLVED! Marvel, DC Comics, Dark Horse, Image and others have had their time in the spot light now its time to usher in the new Independent and Exclusively Published Characters & Story Lines. Independent creators have a uneasy and somewhat of a difficult time selling their independent and original creations at Comic Cons that seem to only cater to Marvel, DC, Image, ext... along with the Cosplayers that seem to have become the celebrity stars at these events. You have to stop and ask yourself where do you think the ideas and creations of the characters come from? It's from the independent guys, and some of their creations are stolen by the large entertainment companies. Black Label ComiCon wants to set a new level of entertainment that is a nourishing atmosphere for people willing to put their hearts and minds into giving people something brand new and creations that have purpose. The comic book industry has become stagnate in trying to produce new content especially when it comes to diverse characters of color and sexual orientations, since they rarely hire people of color to create for them. They rather have these talented sisters and brothers of color and different sexual orientation repeat and revamp old concepts, they take true creativity out of the game and only do whats safe. Some times you have to go against the grain and produce what is truly meaningful. Black Label ComiCon plans to break the traditional rule, we want to usher in new ideas for people from many different walks of life. Black Label ComiCon plans to establish itself as the first truly Indy Publishing Con on the East Coast, but to also celebrate the accomplishments and the History of Black Wall Street. The creators at this event have put a lot on the line to be here and they would kindly love your support. www.BlackLabelComiCon.com There will be Vendors of uniquely owned individual properties, Too Many Artist to put on here, but many have the heart of these Legendary Creators.

This Kickstarter's goal is to print the first four chapters of the book in a full-color, softcover collection. Denizens of a magically isolated city are under constant threat of monster attacks. By day, they live a relatively normal life. By night, deadly monsters roam the streets. Thankfully, the civilians can rely on the city's many Magical Girls to protect them from harm. Adored and celebrated by the populace, the Magical Girls are entrusted with great power and even greater expectations. Sadly, there's only so much pressure a teenager can take. The combination of the idol culture surrounding these girls, along with the genuine life-or-death struggle they face every night, forces them to grow quickly and adapt constantly. Perhaps it's a blessing that this barely gives them time to worry about the city's many secrets, not to mention the uncertain fate of the world outside. Undine is the water-wielding member of the popular Team Alchemical. While she's been happy to play a supporting role to the other four members of her team, a sudden tragedy forces her to learn to fight her own battles. A search for answers will lead her on a path to uncovering even deeper mysteries than she knew existed. Sleepless Domain is a coming of age story about expectations, loss, friendship through healing and hardship, and the price of magic. Basically, it's a story about typical teen girl stuff. The first English edition of Sleepless domain contains the first 4 chapters of the webcomic, printed as a full color, softcover, 7x10.5 book. The first 2 chapters were drawn by the very talented Oscar Vega, and written by Mary Cagle, artist and writer of all the subsequent chapters. The full comic can be read online here, where it is published by Hiveworks. In addition to the book itself, backers can select tiers that offer various other rewards. Check out the tiers below. Digital rewards include a wallpaper set and a digital copy of the book. Physical rewards include the book and a stationery set composed of a sticker sheet and a double-sided bookmark. As limited rewards, we have bookplates sketched and signed by Mary and acrylic character standees of HP and Undine! An adorable stationery set! 6-inch tall acrylic standee set of the two leads! The primary production costs of this Kickstarter will go toward printing the book, which is why additional stretch goals will be mostly focused on adding fun details to the book itself, rather then adding physical rewards. We'll be announcing them as they are unlocked! $25,000 - Spot Gloss added to the cover! $35,000 - Additional Concept and Commentary section in the back of book! $45,000 - A Fancy Team Alchemical mini print included with all physical tiers! The Hiveworks team will be helping with backer management, printing and shipping, and have already begun preparing the book for print. Special thanks to Rhiannon R.S. for the color correction and pre-press work on the comic. Thank you for helping us print Sleepless Domain Book 1! Be sure to check out Mary Cagle's work on Twitter and Patreon, and to give the comic a read! The music used in the video is Billion Stars by Remember the Future."

In the interim, Kathleen has lived in Ireland, the Netherlands, and now lives in Glasgow, Scotland; Everest spent half a year abroad in France and just moved to Montr�al, Qu�bec; and Guillaume has lived a quiet, charming existence at home in Putney, VT. Despite our geographic distance, our love for playing together has only grown. While we have continued to fly Kathleen back to the States to play for contra dance weekends, we have all collectively fallen in love with contemporary bal folk and Scottish music throughout our travels. This upcoming album will represent these new musical influences while remaining true to our roots as New England dance musicians. Photo by Dylan Ladds The Studio We will be recording at Studio Trad in Aalst, Belgium with the inimitable Jeroen Geerinck as our recording engineer. Jeroen is a formidable guitar player in bal folk bands such as Hot Griselda, Snaarmaarwaar, and Novar. As this album represents our newfound enthusiasm for bal folk music, we are beyond excited to be able to record in Europe with the support of one of our musical heroes. A note on our recording location: We debated long and hard about where to record our next album. We did a cost analysis of recording at Studio Trad versus recording within the United States. We decided to record at Studio Trad for the following reasons: Kathleen and Everest will both be in Europe this summer and it is cheaper to get Guillaume to Belgium than it is to get Kathleen and Everest back to the United States. Studio Trad was built and run by folk musicians who deeply understand the music we make and will help us create exactly the sound we want. Even with the exchange rate, the costs of recording/mixing/mastering are cheaper in Europe than in the States Studio Trad offers album artwork as a package, which saves us the cost of hiring a separate album designer.

We've teamed up with Shut Up & Sit Down to create a HUGE new box of Monikers! At 330 cards, it's TRIPLE the size of our last collaboration. And at $20, it's only DOUBLE the price. What a steal! But for real, the cards are so funny and good: The box is full of pure comedy writing perfection, all 100% created by Shut Up & Sit Down and friends of the show! If you've never heard of Monikers before, the rules are super simple: get your friends to guess the name on the card. The twist is that you play over three rounds, and each time, you have to give clues in different ways. So in the 1st round, you can say or do anything. In the 2nd, you can only use one word. And in the 3rd, you can only do charades. The same deck of 50 or so cards are used in each round, so by the end of the game, you and your friends have made up a bunch of hilarious jokes together. Here's a really fun let's play video from Polygon that'll give you a good idea of what Monikers is like: And if you're still on the fence about the whole thing, here are some nice things people have said about the game: Monikers is also in the top 10 party games of all time on BoardGameGeek (in your FACE, Dixit: Odyssey) and has a 4.7 rating on Amazon from hundreds of reviewers. So if you like party games and laughing and just fun in general, we think you'll get a kick of out it. If you can believe it, the original Monikers kickstarter was 5 YEARS AGO. We want to keep things going for another 5 years AT LEAST�sorry in advance�so we've completely revamped our product line for how we want to release new games in the future. And we wrapped everything up in all new packaging, illustrated by the *brilliant* C�cile Gari�py as one long, ridiculous, interconnected party: Here's how the boxes are organized now: Monikers - The base 440-card set. For completionists, the base game has had about 30-40% turnover since the initial 2015 release, so if you have a super old copy, now might be the time to update. Monikers: Classics - This box combines all our previous small box expansions: Shmonikers, Something Something, and the original Shut Up & Sit Down Nonsense Box from a couple years ago. Monikers: More Monikers - The big box set from last year, condensed down to 330 cards and a normal sized box. We moved some of the leftover cards to Monikers and Classics, and cut a few that we think didn't age as well as the rest. Monikers: Serious Nonsense - The brand new set from Shut Up & Sit Down! It also includes the MUCH REQUESTED return of the 12 Hopelessly Stupid Fourth Rounds! ALL boxes come with rulebooks and are completely playable on their own! And because we hate AIR, all the cards have the same snug and compact fit as the old base game. We're so so so thrilled with the new box and CANNOT WAIT to get everything to you later in the year."

The sole motivation in creating and publishing ""I'm Glad You're In Our Family"" is to share a delightful message about adoption and bring families closer together. Any proceeds from sales will be used to benefit birth mothers and couples in the process of adoption. This campaign is to raise the money needed to cover the costs of developing a high-quality children's book and having it ready to sell at an affordable price. The funds raised will be used for the time investment from the artist, the proof copies (ensure high quality), and other various costs which are necessary to have a book ready to sell. If the target is reached, the book will be released in the Fall of 2019. Thank you for backing this project and playing a part in bringing the story to life.

The story begins with a little girl�s witty objection to the various reasons she�s been told she needs a good night�s rest. This book introduces readers to the creative and insightful thinking of an inspired little girl who could think of anything she�d rather do than go to sleep. The most exciting things happen after dark and maybe there are reasons she can explain to her parents about why she should stay up late. Author MaKayla Rose (photo by Meghann Roper) I love, love, love to read. I especially like reading books when the main character reminds me of myself. My name is MaKayla. My friends call me Kayla. I live with my mom, dad, and little sister in New Jersey. One of my favorite authors, Beverly Cleary, said Mrs. Cleary inspired me to write my own stories and I found that I love to write almost as much as I love to read! Late one night, I created the opposite of a bedtime story called Why Bedtime Sucks, because I couldn�t find a book I wanted to read for a bedtime story. MaKayla and Brianna (photo by Meghan Roper) It�s a story told from a kid's point of view explaining why they do not like bedtime and disputing some of the reasons parents give us for why we should get a good night�s sleep. Starring ME. I put myself in my story, and I added my family. Now I can find the book I want to read on my bookshelf. My story became a book at the end of the school year as a teacher appreciation gift for my first grade teacher, Mrs Kizitaff. Mrs. Kizitaff told me she'd like a copy of my first book, before I ever considered turning my story into a book. Her request sparked the idea!

We wanted to make the illustrations in this book as close to the images I first illustrated and imagined while writing the story. By working closely with Isabel my vision is becoming a reality and my character has my face and my personality in her artistic style.

Another way is with book donations to an organization that has made it their mission to address the literacy gap one state at a time. The 50 States 50 Books project provides free diverse books to kids nationwide. Every pledge level above dawn includes a book donation to the 50 states 50 books project.

Personally i find her personality similar to cat woman, who does things for herself and her friends but others don't really matter. Jinx has stated that she ""I'm bad luck. Good was never an option for me."" giving her a more sad kind of motivation for being a bad guy because she can't be anything else.

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The Manhattan Transfer may be the most influential, iconic and beloved vocal harmony group in modern musical history. Tracing their origins from the New York club scene, through their nearly five decades of award-winning music and thousands of performances, this film will be an intimate and honest look into the true story of The Transfer as told by its members, colleagues, friends, and celebrities who have taken part in their fantastic journey. Through the good times and bad, hits and misses, loves and tragic loss, they have given us nearly half a century of great music and fantastic stories, and they're not done yet! It�s a backstage musical, a family drama, a tale about an incredible array of fascinating characters and their complex relationships, and ultimately a story of love. Plus, it will be packed with great musical performances by the Transfer and their musical influences. We are so grateful that The Transfer is opening up their vaults to hours of rare performances and never before seen backstage footage that will completely knock your socks off. It is our mission to bring it all to you. It�s a story that cries out to be told and preserved on film for the ages. I love art, I love jazz and soul, I love documentaries (I was even nominated for an Oscar for one), and I�ve loved The Manhattan Transfer�s music for decades. I also love great 4-part vocal harmony�of which The Transfer has set the bar. I hope this documentary will help bring it back into fashion. I first met Alan Paul, one of the group�s founders, when our daughters sang together in their high school vocal jazz group. The group even opened for a Transfer concert and won the Best High School Jazz Vocal Group award at the Monterrey Jazz Festival. Alan and I often carpooled and have stayed good friends ever since. Over the years, Alan has shared with me many personal stories of The Transfer and its members, from their childhoods to their founding, through nearly 5 decades of music, awards, and fans. I�ve been particularly interested in how the group stayed together for all these decades, long after most musical groups have broken up. I hope this film will enlighten audiences to their secret, while presenting backstage and performance footage, much of which has never been seen in public before. Although I�m one of the filmmakers, I can�t wait to see it. I hope you feel the same. Miles Mogulescu, Director No one sings 4-part harmony like The Manhattan Transfer. Recognized by fans, critics, and fellow musicians for their mastery of Jazz, R & B, Doo-Wop, Pop, and Bebop, they are, quite simply, the gold standard. It is hard to think of another internationally acclaimed group who has flourished as long at such a high level. The Transfer have won 11 Grammys, recorded over 30 albums and collaborated with the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Jon Hendricks, Smokey Robinson, Bette Midler, The Count Basie Orchestra, Chick Corea, Frankie Valli, Bobby McFerrin, Take 6, and Weather Report. They�ve thrilled millions of fans around the world from small clubs, to major concert halls, to giant stadiums, running the gamut from being the summer replacement for The Cher Show on CBS, to performing at The Palace Theater in London to headlining Disney Hall in Los Angeles.

This project means the world to me for several reasons: No. 1 - It is one of my bucket-list items is to get a book published; No. 2 - I look forward to the satisfaction of actually getting a book published; But most importantly, No. 3 - I will sincerely enjoy sharing my love of this region's history with even more people.

My day job is a middle school English teacher. As such, I don't have a lot of money to throw around. The proceeds of this call to action would provide me with the funds to make the publication of this compilation book a reality and once I'm done with this first book, Volume 1, I'll move on to the next book, Volume 2, which will be about other places in Southern Utah, Northern Arizona and Southern Nevada."

What we came up with was Perplexity. Playing cards with a back design that always appears symmetrical, but the focal point for the symmetry changes based on the viewers perspective. Our primary goal was to design a deck of cards with magicians and cardists in mind so each Perplexity deck includes a double back, jokers that were made with changes in mind, and a special reveal on the one of the jacks. We have also included a bonus reveal on the tuck box. We didn't want to use traditional pips, so we decided to go with green and dark brown pips to make the faces of the cards stand out. Naturally this brought the face cards into the same color scheme. And lastly, we wanted to create something rare and meaningful to collectors, so the first version of Perplexity will only have 1000 decks printed... EVER. Making this the only chance to get a V1 Perplexity deck. There will be 20 uncut sheets available to those that really love the rarities. Version two will be released down the road, but will have a redesigned tuck, as well as other changes, and will not be a limited run. Perplexity will be printed by USPCC, so you can expect the highest standard of quality.

Oil cleansing? Skip the soap and just use the bar! Coconut Oil is antibacterial and will cleanse and nourish your skin! BENEFITS. Hand crafted in small batches, these lotion bars will keep your skin hydrated all day long! Essential oils nourish and treat the skin with their distinct healing properties. Raw cacao butter is superior to cocoa butter because it hasn't been treated with high heat, which destroys vital nutrients. Raw cacao butter is rich in antioxidants, polyphenols and essential fatty acids. Coconut oil is a great emollient if the barrier function of your skin is disturbed . It's great at repairing and restoring this quickly as it is rapidly absorbed into the epidermis. Coconut oil contains Vitamin E, essential amino acids, and lauric and caprylic acid which form part of the barrier function of your skin and help maintain your skin's natural flora. Bees Wax forms a protective barrier to seal in your gorgeous glow while improving the feel and appearance of your skin. FOR VEGAN OPTION: Candelilla wax- This vegetable wax is often used as a viable substitution for beeswax, which is great for vegan lifestyles. Candelilla wax is rich in nutrients and easily absorbed into the body, scalp and hair while creating an instant barrier to prevent moisture loss in the body, scalp and hair. SKIN CARE WITHOUT COMPROMISE: Lotion bars have a reputation for being a health-conscious choice because they are free from the potentially hazardous chemicals found in commercial lotion products, such as phthalates, parabens, formaldehyde, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), ethanolamines and petroleum. Lotion bars are mess-free and convenient. GREEN BEAUTY: They look like a bar of soap but require no plastic bottle/ Environmental Footprint. With organic ingredients, the process for creating a lotion bar is low impact, supporting a green planet!"

My name is Jess and I love all things video game and cute, and sell cute video game inspired art at conventions around the Midwest. In early 2018 I made the decision to expand my product line to include enamel pins. Since I worked in vectors already, it was a perfect fit for my style. I wanted to create a series that showed off my love of video games, and also celebrated the LGBTQ+ community. It took several months of trial, error, and manufacturer research, but eventually this series was born! To get my feet wet in the pinmaking game, I ordered a design (mostly for myself!) to see how the process works, and to see if my concept had a market. I released the bisexual Switch pin in January 2019, and it has been incredibly popular both at conventions and online! This was enough for me to want to expand the series to include more consoles and more pride flags, as many as I could come up with. These pins will be hard enamel with nickel metal and 1.5� at their longest point. Each pin has two posts with rubber clutches for security. All pins shown as ""unlocked"", including our existing bi pin, will be available as rewards at the end of the campaign. The initial goal of $1500 covers the production of the first four designs. The goal also covers Kickstarter fees, packaging and shipping material, as well as marketing materials. Each stretch goal will have two or three additional pins to unlock, for a total of 13 pins. If we smash through all of my pin stretch goals, we can start reaching toward getting stickers made of all 14 designs - including the bi switch! The image shown above shows the pins in their first conceptual vectored state. Prototypes of the pins will be developed during and after the campaign, and I will share all progress in the updates section of this campaign. The sticker stretch goal will unlock 3"" vinyl stickers of all 14 pin designs, including our existing bi switch pin. Want more than three pins? Want to add a bi switch pin to your order? You will be able to add additional goodies to your order in your survey! Just be sure to add the equivalent amount on top of your pledge total (i.e. if you wanted four pins, you would pledge $40+shipping). If we unlock stickers, you can add $3 to your pledge for each sticker you would like. Note: Stickers WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE until we reach $5000 in funding! June 1 - June 30: Kickstarter Campaign Early July: Surveys sent after successful funding, pins ordered July-October: Pin production October: Shipping to you! Please note this is an ideal timeline, with some padding to account for any delays. Should anything happen during production (or if things move faster than I anticipated), I will keep everyone updated. This breakdown is for the initial $1500 goal. Percentages will change as we unlock more pins, but I have accounted for those every step of the way. To stay updated outside of the campaign, feel free to follow me on social media!

Kara�s Chimi Chimi brings meat dishes to life and can be used for dipping chips and vegetables too. It can also be served as a spread or a condiment on tacos, salads, sandwiches and so much more. Tired of the same old sauces giving your foods the same old flavors? We were too, and that was why we set out to make something different, our very own chimichurri that we could use as a universal sauce. What makes our Chimichurri different? Unlike most Chimichurris you find at stores, Kara's Chimi Chimi is Refrigerated Organic Creamy (dairy free!) A zesty and garlic-y compliment to all of your grilled meats, sandwiches, dips. Introducing: Kara's Chimi Chimi During a group camping trip in 2018, paired with Brazilian BBQ, Kara's Chimi Chimi was an instant hit, both kids and parents couldn�t get enough of it. It has been Kid-Approved many times over and kids don't want to share! Because of its creamy texture, you can use Kara's Chimi Chimi on just about anything: eggs, sandwiches, tacos, chips � whatever you're in the mood for. Our plan is to launch Kara's Chimi Chimi in Original flavor first and then launch Cilantro and Spicy shortly after. Let us tell you a little more. Certified Organic We have gone through the extra steps in order for Kara's Chimi Chimi to be USDA Certified Organic. So if you like to know where your food is coming from and what standard the ingredients are held to, you can have the utmost confidence when enjoying this sauce. You never have to feel like you are going into the kitchen (or the grocery store) blind again, every container of Kara's Chimi Chimi carries the USDA Certified Organic seal so you know that we're using the best ingredients. Vegan, Kosher, Halal, Keto-Friendly Not only is Kara�s Chimi Chimi superior in taste and texture, it is also meets all the dietary requirements above�jam packed with so much goodness! You can enjoy it on anything � without worrying that you are crossing any of your own personal boundaries. Non-GMO Of course, this would go without saying, USDA Organic Certified also means Non-GMO. From the start, we have wanted this sauce to stand for quality and the values that we seek out in food ourselves. Gluten-Free & Dairy-Free Even though our Chimichurri is creamy, it is completely dairy free and gluten free so you can rest assured that you can fearlessly enjoy. Made to Share Each container of Kara's Chimi Chimi features a wide mouth, making dipping and sharing easy. On the go, in the office, or at home with your loved ones, Kara's Chimi Chimi is just the sauce that you want to have stocked in your fridge, something that everyone can enjoy together � totally guilt-free! What We Need & What You Get Right now, we are turning to you to help raise funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute Kara's Chimi Chimi on a larger scale. We also would like to launch 2 additional flavors: Cilantro and Spicy. We're almost at the finish line and have overcome most of our hurdles. Our goal through this campaign is to raise $5,000 which will cover all the costs that we are facing as we take this special sauce and bring it to the Organic foods world. One of the greatest challenges that we currently looking to solve is shipping the Chimi Chimi chilled to destinations on the East Coast. We have been looking at several different solutions and are close to finding an option that works. To show our appreciation for all your support, we are honored to offer early access to Kara's Chimi Chimi exclusively through this campaign. An Entrepreneurial Dream -The Female Trio Just like mom, Kara at age 10, is a fierce entrepreneur, we are working on this together. Kara has also passed on this spirit of ambition and creation to her younger sister (our master taster), making our team a trio, and we couldn't be any happier with the way things are going. We want Kara's Chimi Chimi to be known as a healthy, simple flavor option, something that is equal parts nutritious and delicious. We know we can make this work with your help! Other Ways You Can Help After you make a contribution to our campaign, please let all your friends and family know what Kara's Chimi Chimi is. We want to spread the word about this sauce far and wide, and we know that social media is the way to do that. We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for taking the time to read about our plans."

Accessibility is important because not only is it the right thing to do, but because it significantly increases our ability to negotiate for an affordable long-term lease, in addition to making additional avenues of funding available to us via project and facilities grants! MOONSHOT GOAL $30,680 - Fund a wheelchair lift to become a fully accessible space! Due to our high loading dock entrance, temporary or ramp-based accessibility plans are not available to us. Any and all money raised beyond our viability goals will go into a fund for this accessibility device, and we hope to fully fund the $15000-20000 construction project if possible! The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven is Portland�s longest running entirely volunteer DIY performance space and arts venue. Steep and Thorny was artistically founded by Myrrh Larsen and Megan Skye Hale, a couple of working artists who stumbled into providing a space that is one part night club, one part performance venue, and one part arts incubator. Most of what we do is offer a safe place to foster ambitious and creative work from performers of all disciplines. We sat down with the building's new owners to finalize the new agreement and discovered that the effective rent increase is actually significantly higher than what we were given to understand from the offer. We adjusted our plan to meet the new math: $9,830 - Fund 9 months of our expanded responsibility in the space, to provide a contingency fund while we ramp up our fiscal sustainability plans. This includes 3 extra months at the higher rate in order to accommodate for the extra funds we will need to raise and give us time to work our plans up to that higher rate. STRETCH GOAL $10,680 - Fund new avenues of revenue intake via filing for tax-deductable status for our resident projects. This way Speculative Drama and Susurrations Productions can pay The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven rent for their use of the space, helping to cover overhead costs. Facing a significant rent increase, we are looking to fundraise a nine month grace period to keep this vital Portland landmark alive � and implement a long term plan for finances that doesn�t compromise the dedication to artists AND audiences that we are known for! For the last 8 years The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven has been Portland�s home for the underground arts. With performances ranging from aerial circus, to dance, to our resident musical artist Myrrh Larsen and theatre company Speculative Drama, we have spent the better part of the last decade encouraging the growth of high-quality performance arts in the inner Southeast Portland Industrial area. Now the realities of a growing city have caught up with us and we need YOUR HELP to enact a sustainable long term financial plan. With 100% of in-house production door proceeds going directly to performers, and helmed by two struggling artist working as volunteers, overhead costs are largely paid for by rentals, donations, and concession sales of our infamous virgin and adult beverages. Our budget includes six months of Myrrh�s financial burden in the venue, and any additional funds raised go directly toward essential fundraising avenues and a permanent accessibility plan in the form of a wheelchair lift. We have nearly ten years of successfully running a Portland institution on a shoestring, and our backer rewards include some of the best art, events, and cocktails in the city. The risk is low, and the rewards are high for backers of this project! In addition to these stretch goals, we will be posting milestone rewards for you, our public support system, here on our Kickstarter project page! These rewards include behind-the-scenes interviews with our Artistic Directors Myrrh and Megan, blooper reels from the kickstarter video, a live cocktail lesson and toast with us when we reach our goal, and more! What your Money Goes to: 9 months of Myrrh�s financial responsibility at The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven (total rent partially subsidized)- $8910 Estimated Kickstarter Fees - $920"

Music makes it easier to memorize things: the order of the colors in the visible spectrum, the number of days in a month, the names of U.S. presidents. The songs we know can take us back to specific places in our memories. When Josh�s grandmother was in the last years of her life and starting to have trouble remembering peoples� names and even some of the events of her life, she could still recall the words of the songs she had loved as a girl. The Bible commands Christians to memorize Scripture and emphasizes several benefits that come from memorizing Scripture. Psalm 119:11 says, �I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.� God�s memorized Word is a reserve, like Joseph�s grain in Egypt�s cities, ready for the long, lean years. Colossians 3:16 talks about letting the Word of Christ �dwell in you richly,� a picture of God�s Word alive in us. Proverbs 30:5 tells us that �every word of God proves true.� In other words, God�s Word has been tested. In 2016, our church began sending out a Scripture memory verse or passage each month. Our family looked forward to receiving each verse, and soon after, we were inspired to write songs to go along with the verses. We had both written music for existing lyrics in the past. Kirsten had co-written a new melody to �And Can It Be� a couple of years earlier with Dave Hunt that appeared on our church's worship CD (Amazing Love), and Josh had written music for a couple of musicals back in college. Without much of a plan beyond just trying to find melodies for the verses, we started making up songs on the guitar or piano and singing them around the house. We wrote all of the songs in the midst of daily life. Josh wrote the melody to the first one, Proverbs 30:5 (�Every word of God proves true. He is a shield to all who take refuge in him,�) while giving our kids their baths one night. Writing these songs felt like play, and it became something we looked forward to each month. We didn�t pick the verses ourselves, so we didn�t know what was coming next. But as we started looking at the songs, we started noticing patterns in the aspects of God�s character that the verses emphasized. By the end of the year, we had a collection of songs that told a coherent story about God--the Creator, the Father, the Shield, the Patient One. We started sending rough recordings via email to the families in our church, and we had many people tell us how applicable the songs were to the situations their children were going through. We also noticed how much we were singing these songs in our own home, and how these songs helped us to imprint God's word on our hearts and minds, as well as our children's. It was so exciting to watch our kids memorize these verses and start humming them to themselves throughout the day. After seeing the impact the songs made, we decided to launch this Kickstarter project to produce recordings of the Scripture songs that we could share inside and outside of our church community. Asher Peterson will be producing the record, and we couldn�t ask for a better fit for the project. He plays drums for the Gray Havens, he�s toured with his family as part of Andrew Peterson and the Family Band, and he�s the mastermind behind NAMO, a Nashville-based music collective. He also interns for Josh�s brother Ben at The Beehive. You can hear what his work on this project will sound like by listening to Psalm 19:1, which you can hear in the Kickstarter video or on streaming services. The CD will have ten songs. We've printed the lyrics for the verses below: Psalm 19:1 - The heavens declare the glory of God, and the stars above proclaim His handiwork. Psalm 121:1-2 - I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Proverbs 30:5 - Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 1 Peter 1:3 - Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. John 1:14 - And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. Ephesians 4:6 - ...one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. Isaiah 43:5 - Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you. Phillipians 4:6-7 - Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Colossians 3:23 - Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men. 2 Peter 3:9 - The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. (Note: These aren�t in the order in which they�ll appear on the CD, and some of the songs might be expanded a bit to include surrounding material in the passage.) The budget of our project is $7,500. This amount is a big goal for us to meet on our own, so that's why we decided to put together a Kickstarter campaign to ask for you to partner with us in completing this project. We hope you will consider investing a project that will encourage you in remembering God's word in your everyday life. Please don't forget to check out our rewards. One of our reward items is an amazing Psalm 19:1 coloring sheet designed by Jennifer Trafton (jennifertrafton.com). We also have an option for you to make your own choice for Scripture wall art designed by Amanda Groh or Jennifer Trafton. Lastly, we have accompaniment tracks and a songbook so that you (or your ministry) can have these resources to play and sing these songs on your own. Thanks again for considering being a part of this project. We are praying that it will help you keep the words of Deuteronomy 11:19, which says this about God's words: ""You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise."" ~Josh and Kirsten"

We are beyond ecstatic! You are the reason this story will come to life. We are particularly grateful for the leadership of women clergy who have been sharing and pledging fiercely.

Margo & Nikki Instagram @PhilElevenDoc // Twitter @PhilElevenDoc // Facebook @PhilElevenDoc The Film Eleven women were ordained Episcopal priests against church rules in Philadelphia in 1974. They hit a chord, in a deeply divided world, by questioning who speaks the word of God. The media caught on, and the women priests were thrust into an international limelight. In 1975 four more women were ordained priests. At the time of the ordinations, the women were on a personal journey of faith. Each woman had to decide how to live out her priesthood in the face of an institution that did not accept her. The Philadelphia Eleven (working title) is a feature documentary film that will tell the story of these women priests in their words. Why now? It will inspire a new generation. The patriarchy is flexing its muscles again. This is a story about women who followed their call, and in doing so challenged society to acknowledge them. We can learn lessons from those whose shoulders we stand on. This struggle continues. It is still a challenge to be a woman priest; and women are still kept from the biggest decision-making tables around the globe. Time is of the essence. Many of the ""eleven"" are with us, but they are quickly aging. This story resonates. What does it mean to be whole? How do we pursue our vocations, regardless of obstacles? How do we keep our integrity, when it feels like the easy answers ask us to compromise? How do we stand up for justice in every moment, when life pulls us in so many different directions? No gift is too small. By supporting this campaign, you are actually making this film with us. That is why we lovingly refer to you as our ""film family."" What we have done. Since 2015, we have taken ten trips around the country, and filmed 12 interviews. We have held phone conversations with an additional seven people who were intimately involved, and begun sourcing archival footage. Grants from MassHumanities and the LEF Moving Image Fund have supported this work, plus unimaginable hours of volunteer time driven by passion and given with love. Storytelling is a very personal endeavor, and we know how much faith it takes to trust others to tell your story. We are humbled to have earned the trust of the women priests with their stories. For that we are grateful, and we take the responsibility seriously. What we still need to do. There is so much more to film, and many more archives to go through. After we gather all the footage, we will need to edit the film. There is a long road ahead. With your help, we can bring this film to life. Rewards.

The more we raise, the bigger the audience for the film. We want to show the world that viewers are hungry for a documentary film about the original women priests. ON OUR WAY: If we raise $70,000, you will help us move this project forward! Our funds support the production crew and archive researcher who work to gather footage. There is very little overhead, because we all work from home offices. FINISH PRODUCTION: If we raise $120,000, you will fund the completion of filming. The farther we get in production, the more money we spend on an editor. FIRST ROUGH-CUT OF FILM: If we raise $235,000, you will fund us all the way to our first rough-cut! At this point our production crew expense is for archive research and producing, and a lot of our time is now in the edit room.

Carpe Diem was introduced to music when in university when he was trying to find his passion. Amongst his studies, he would find refuge in playing with production software like Fruity Loops and Ableton. after spending his entire university career essentially learning nothing about mechanical engineering, and everything about audio engineering and production, he honed some skills to start DJ'ing some of his tracks. He also developed a new style of music in which he calls Classical EDM. he spent most of his time at an underground music venue DJ'ing in the Lower East Side. There, he found his love for performing live in front of crowds. Retrop befriended many talented artists in the industry and became a student of the craft. After 3 years of DJing for at multiple venues in LES, Carpe Diem met another musician named DJ Retrop, where they created a strong musical bond. They got along quickly and decided that it was best to combine EDM and classical and take it to the next level. That's when they decided to create a collaboration album. The collab album has been in the works for the last few months and now they're ready to show the world what it's about. Their hopes is to really create a new subgenre and take the world by storm."

It's got jungles, pirate ships, lava, tigers, a sought-after treasure, an enchantress--basically all the ingredients for your child's ideal pirate quest. First and foremost this book is about engaging your child in a great story that you can both cherish. But, what's awesome about Princess Pirates is that on top of that, this book: 1) Role models bold, brave female characters which are important for children of both genders to see! Girls need more adventure books to see strong, bold, and DARING people they can relate to! And you know what? Boys need to see girls in these kinds of role too! 2) Encourages children to use imagination to foster creativity. Imagination is a magical thing! Children have an amazing ability to find joy in pretending, especially when you can get them away from screen time for a bit. This book helps children see how they can re-imagine their surroundings into new adventures to do just that. This kind of imagination sparks valuable creativity that will serve them their whole life long. 3) Tears down gender stereotypes. Useless gender stereotypes not only limit a child�s imagination, but their thoughts on possibilities for their future. Girls shouldn�t feel like because society has said pirates are a �boy thing� they shouldn�t like them. Who cares what �society� says?! Be you and love it! 4) Helps develop vocabulary and reading skills in a fun way. This book is a rhyming book which is fun for smaller children to hear and really helps early readers develop their reading skills. There are just a couple words that your child may not know--this was done on purpose because I think children�s books are the perfect opportunity to grow your child�s vocabulary! WHAT IS PRINCESS PIRATES ? Princess Pirates is the story of three sisters as they dare to be brave and imagine a whole new world right inside their very home. They start off as princesses in their castle but hear an enchantress has their treasure. They then become pirates, too, and embark on a daring adventure. They sail across oceans, cross a river of lava, travel through the jungle, and even fight tigers to find their treasure. There is nothing too difficult that these fearless girls cannot find a way through! HOW YOU CAN HELP AND WHAT YOU'LL GET FOR IT! While I have written this book and have had it fully illustrated, when you back this project you're really pre-ordering Princess Pirates to help me fund my first production run of books. Here are the various rewards can you get for backing: $10 3 PDF coloring pages Receive 3 PDF coloring pages for your kids, sketched by the magnificent Polina Klimenko! These will be e-mailed to you so you can print them over and over again for your child(ren) to color! $28 ($24 early bird!) One hardcover book, eye patch, 3 PDF coloring pages Receive ONE hard cover copy of Princess Pirates plus ONE eye patch for your child's next swashbuckling adventure and the THREE PDF coloring pages sketched exclusively for this Kickstarter. $54 ($35 early bird!) 2 hardcover books, 2 eye patches, 3 PDF coloring pages $108 ($67 early bird!) 4 hardcover books, 4 eye patches, 3 PDF coloring pages $130 ($82 early bird!) 5 hardcover books, 5 eye patches, 3 PDF coloring pages $240 ($150 early bird!) 10 hardcover books, 10 eye patches, 3 PDF coloring pages Thank YOU and don't forget to follow me!

If funded, it will offer a huge variety of units to fill all the needs one may have from tabletop RPGs to the myriad of wargames that have some form of evil dwarfs. Models have been tailored to fit the 9th Age rule system for which we are a supporting company. Everything is sculpted digitally with some minor adjustments by hand and all prototypes will be 3D printed with a high resolution resin printer. Production is then made by our own hands, spincasting in high quality metal, so we can ensure the highest level of detail. We are making the models in 28mm heroic scale and 10mm. From the bottom of feet in 28mm hobgoblins are around 28-35 mm tall and dwarfs 25-35 (some of the hats are big). For 10mm, models are scaled to the standard so they work with other 10mm fantasy makers out. Hobgoblins are 12-15mm and dwarfs are all around 15mm, plus or minus. Hobgoblins are much taller than dwarfs. Dwarfs are fatter and have much larger hats. We bought 2 soon to be 3 printers, resin, a spincaster. We need to buy mold making materials and equipment, metal, and living expenses. We have also dedicated 4 months to this project full time already and several part time. We seek your help to fund the masters for the models, the production molds, and the materials required for the casting as well as the production expenses. What you will get are the models you have been wanting at a discounted price from future retail. You will get the models before they go for retail sale. You will also get exclusive Kickstarter models and bonus goodies, have access to making stretch goals available, exclusive army deals, and shipping subsidies.We plan on having models shipping out to buyers august-september. We hope you will join us on this adventure. www.dancingyakminiatures.com www.facebook.com/dancingyakminiatures Disclaimer: All models come unpainted and without bases (except Admiralty Miniatures' Slave Drivers which come with bases.)

We are a small team from Sweden that loves to push buttons. We invented the Smart Button in 2013. Thanks to our amazing community, we have run two successful crowdfunding campaigns before and delivered on both of them. Today, we are very excited to show you what we have been up to for the last three years. Kickstarter - welcome Flic 2 and the Flic Hub LR! Flic is a small push button. In the Flic App, you choose what you want to happen when you push, push twice, or hold it down. You don't need to talk to Flic. You don't need to unlock your phone or trust that an AI will figure you out. You just have to push a button. We�ve taken everything we�ve learned from making smart buttons for over six years, we�ve listened to feedback from the community and revisited every single detail to come up with a product that we sincerely believe is the perfect button. The Flic Hub is an optional accessory to Flic so you don't have to connect the buttons to your phone. It has also been rebuilt from the ground up to optimize performance, to add HomeKit capability, and to add Bluetooth Long Range. The most common ways our community use Flic are to toggle lights and control music. But people are really creative, there are literally thousands of wildly different things that people use Flic shortcuts for! We all have different routines. What we do when we wake up in the morning, how we get to work, and how we structure our day. Flic is a tool that helps you simplify your everyday routines. Instead of different apps or complicated voice commands, structure your life with buttons! A push-of-a-button life doesn�t have to be complicated. Quite the opposite! Reduce the clutter with technology that just works. There are a large number of integrations already in the Flic App and ready to use! Through third-party services such as IFTTT, Zapier, and Microsoft Flow, practically anything is possible. And if you're an advanced tech user, with our versatile HTTP Request function you can write your own commands in the Flic App. Everyone knows how to push a button. We have seen applications for kids, for people with disabilities, for visually impaired, and even for dogs! After 5 years we still see and hear about new amazing things that people do using Flic buttons. Here are just a few things that our community has shared with us: Flic 2 opens up new opportunities that were not possible before while maintaining the world-class simplicity, stability, and security that Flic has been known for. The easiest way to set Flic 2 up is with the free Flic App. The most common Flic features are already available there. Here is how the new 2-step pairing with the App works: How to set it up so that it sends its location to mom - a great safety measure for kids! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The Flic App is already available. Select what you want to happen for each push, double push, and hold. You can even sequence actions, so that multiple things happen when toy push twice, for example. The micro-suction adhesive is included with every Flic 2. The suction adhesive allows you to attach Flic to any surface. Micro-suction means it contains hundreds of tiny suction cups that don�t leave any residue! The suction pad is easy to clean with water and can be reused many times. Yep, Maria throws it up on the roof in the last scene - it sticks there like a magnet! Flic 2 is built for accessories. New label stickers make it easy for you and your guests to understand what each button does. The new rigid multi-purpose metal clip makes Flic easy to attach to keys, clothes, bags, and much more. Flic 2 can give you visual feedback in three colors: green, yellow, and red. Just like traffic lights! It can blink green if your action was successful, yellow while you�re waiting (not applicable for most uses), and red if there is something wrong. With Flic 2, you can access any other app that is open for Flic, and developers can build apps for the entire Flic 2 community. This opens up for A LOT more things you can use Flic for! If you develop a use case for Flic 2, it will immediately be made available to the broader Flic audience. This is something we are extra proud of - Flic 2 can toggle multiple apps at the same time! You can push to turn on the Lights in your lights app and push twice to snooze the alarm-app! Flic 2 can switch mode between being a smart Flic button, a Bluetooth Keyboard/mouse, or a Low latency MIDI controller. With Flic 2, there are many ways to be truly creative. If you�re a musician for example, it can be configured to imitate a wireless amplifier switch. Compared to the original Flic, this button is infinitely more flexible and open. There is no longer a requirement to use the Flic App or the Flic Hub or even to have an internet connection when you set it up. As an example, you can implement our open Flic 2 connection protocol in your Arduino robot, or use our free SDKs for iOS, Android, Linux, or OSX, and many more, without making any stability or security compromises. Read more under For Developers. Every Flic button needs to be connected to something. The common ways are to a phone, a laptop, or a Flic Hub. The benefits of using a Flic Hub is that your Flic buttons don't need your phone to be around in order to work. So in your home or in your office, you can put up buttons that everyone can use even when you are not around. One Flic Hub can be connected to 63 Flic buttons at the same time, while a phone can connect to 6-8 Flics depending on the type of phone. Flic Hub LR (Long Range) has been rebuilt from the ground up, for optimized performance and double range. It has the same discreet and award-winning design as the original Flic Hub, and it packs a lot more power. We are working together with Apple to add HomeKit support to the Flic Hub LR. This means that all your Flic buttons (including original Flics!) that are connected to a Flic Hub LR can be configured in the Apple Home App. So all your buttons will be able to control everything in your Apple Home ecosystem! Since this is a lot of work, we won�t have this in place when we ship the Flic Hub LRs in September, but it will be released as a software update this fall. The IR (Infrared) accessory to the Flic Hub allows you to control things that you otherwise would need a remote control for. Control your TV, Home Entertainment systems, A/C, to name a few. The IR Accessory is the same that was available before. However, due to hardware improvements in the Flic Hub LR, the precision of the IR learning and blasting makes it possible to use for even more devices. Flic 2 and Flic Hub LR both have Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range capability, which means that they can stay connected to each other over larger distances. The range of Bluetooth Long Range can be compared to WiFi if not even better. Flic Hub LR can support Flic 2 buttons scattered in a large apartment or a small house. We truly want to give you the power to create anything. This is why we created the Flic Hub Javascript SDK. With it, you can write code directly on your Flic Hub � in real time! All you need to get started is a Flic Hub and a web browser, no additional software is needed! Read more under For Developers below. When we released Flic for the first time, we got an incredible amount of requests from creatives, developers and entrepreneurs that wanted Flic buttons to work for their corporate applications. Luckily, we could do almost anything they wanted because Flic is so versatile. We provided code they could apply and a plastic casing for Flic that we could print logos on. Here are a few examples: We love to talk about the sports fishing app Anglr, who uses PbF buttons (a white label version of the original Flic) to drop location pins whenever a fish is caught. Anglers with wet and slimy hands can't pull up their smartphones when they�ve just caught a fish! Dominos pizza with their pizza button, Pizza Hut with their pizza ordering shoes (yep) and Clarion Hotels' ""Save Me"" button for boring conferences are all creative and inspiring applications. Sometimes it is not easy to know how a button can make MY life better. We know that once you start with Flic there is so much to discover, and you will soon find Flic shortcuts in your life that can range from mildly convenient to life-saving. Here are some simple getting started ideas: A find-your-phone button in your hallway - push it and your phone will blink and make some noise. A next-slide button for your presentation connected to your laptop - push to advance, push twice to go backward. An ""I'm-home-from school button"" - for your kids to easily let you know that they're home safe. An in your car share-your-location-with-your-spouse button. Send a geo-tag of where you are so that your spouse can see how far you are from home. A play/pause/next-song button in your pocket so you don�t have to tap your headphones or talk to a voice assistant on the run. A counter button to register habits - get a detailed view of how often you change diapers on your baby, how often you drink coffee, where and when you smoke, or at what times you go to sleep. SPECIAL REWARD! You can control most things and services when Flic is connected to your phone or when it's connected to a Flic Hub. When a Flic button is connected to your smartphone, it can also control functions in your phone, such as Find My Phone, Camera Shutter, Share GPS Location, and more. However, this requires your phone to always be near your Flic button. If you intend to have Flic buttons in stationary places at home or in the office, the Flic Hub is for you. The Hub ensures a reliable experience as you do not have to worry about the connection being lost when your smartphone is not near the buttons. Additionally, other people can use the Flic buttons when you are not around. Furthermore, a Flic Hub LR can handle many more Flic buttons than a phone. Using a hub is also the only way to use the IR blaster, Apple HomeKit, and Bluetooth Long Range. By backing this campaign you give proof that you support what we do. Your funding helps us develop the products and as a thank you, we send you the rewards that you want as soon as they are finished. When you support this campaign: You get Flic 2 and the Flic Hub LR at a much lower price than what will be available after the campaign. You receive the products before everyone else. You can help to shape the products as you want by giving early comments and feedback, and by participating in polls and surveys. If you want to be *really* early with trying the products, you can apply to be a beta tester (and accept on some bugs!) You will always be our hero ;) Our current target for starting to ship is September. As with any crowdfunding campaign, an exact reward shipping date cannot be promised as there are things that remain in the product development. We would rather delay a shipment than shipping products that we are not proud of. Flic 2 We have already kicked off the production tooling for Flic 2 so we�re well on the way but there�s still a lot of fine tuning left to be done which we hope we can finalize before end of June to start ramping up the production in July. As soon as we have a production worthy sample we can also start certifying the product. Flic Hub LR The Flic Hub LR is using the same design as the original Hub and therefore the tooling is already in place. The electronics is already designed and tested as well! A lot of the software can be ported from the previous Hub but there�s quite a few new features which requires development time and effort such as Long Range and 5Ghz Wifi which also significantly increases cost and requirements during for the certification process. For every Flic 2 you receive we include a CR2032 battery and our micro-suction adhesive pad. For every Flic Hub LR you receive, there is a USB cable included. A power adapter is not included. Label sticker pack: Add $2 to any reward to get a label sticker pack. Metal Clip: Add $3 to any reward per metal clip that you want. Bundle offers are available for certain rewards. IR Accessory: Add $15 to any reward that includes a Flic Hub LR. How will you know exactly what I wanted? We will send surveys after the campaign and if there is any doubt we will reach out to you directly and ask you! All rewards will be shipped from Sweden. For EU and US VAT and sales tax are included in the rewards. EU and US customers will not be charged any import taxes. For all other countries, taxes and duties may apply. Why? We learned the hard way that we can't ship to countries where our products are not certified or other reasons, they'll get stuck in customs. If you think this makes no sense, let us know! We may very well be wrong about your country. Shortcut Labs was founded in Stockholm over six years ago. What drove us then and what still drives us is the love for buttons that we share with our community. We want to make life simple for everyone, whether they're a super-user with all the smart home gadgets or a toddler who simply wants a light switch that can be mounted right next to their bed. Controlling everything we do with our phones can become frustrating, tiresome and anti-social (as we're always looking at a screen). Voice is a wonderful tool but, quite simply, it's not always appropriate in all situations. Flic is built to make our interactions with smart devices as simple as pushing a button and, through this, it has the ability to enhance and enrich the lives of millions of people every single day. This is our journey and what we're striving to achieve. We'd love you to be part of it. After a few months of tracking his nicotine consumption on his smartphone Joacim, Flic's co-founder decided enough was enough. He had to get out his smartphone, unlock it, find the right app, and then finally register his consumption. It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was complicated. Surely there had to be a more straightforward way? Shortcut Labs was founded in 2013 with the mission to create the world's smartest button. The first version of Flic came out on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo for the first time in 2014. Not only was it able to count nicotine consumption, but a wide range of things were possible. Flic had to be connected to an iOS or Android phone, and the Flic team built every single action right into the Flic Apps. It was a great success, as almost fifteen thousand people backed the campaign. Since then, Flic and Shortcut Labs have been on a rollercoaster startup ride, and today, Joacim and the Flic team have shipped almost half a million shortcut buttons to 85 countries around the world. Flic integrates with hundreds of technologies we all use daily. Every Flic user has a story to tell about how they use their button. From helping them create perfect morning routines to being the guardian angel that keeps their home safe, there are thousands of innovative and imaginative ways Flic is used. But underneath all of them, one thing always remains the same - Flic makes life simple. A shortcut and a life-hack in the form of a button that brings smiles to millions of faces every day. Flic 2 looks similar to our previous PbF buttons or ""Flic Single"" buttons, much because we found this design close to perfect. But Flic 2 is different from its predecessors in many ways. The outer shape is improved, the battery can be replaced, and the surface material has been perfected. But that's just the plastics. The really big differences are in the circuit board and software. The Flic 2 circuit board packs a lot more powerful components. And so does the Hub LR! The new Flic products are completely backward compatible with all previous Flic products. If you have Flic buttons, they will work with the new Flic Hub LR, and if you have an original Flic Hub, it�ll work with Flic 2. The Bluetooth Long Range capability is only achieved with Flic 2 connected with Flic Hub LR, and you can still connect original Flics to your Flic Hub LR at the same time. The Flic App for iOS, Android, and Mac will all support Flic 2s. Long range technology will only be available if your receiving device (phone/laptop) has Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range, however. Apps that have implemented the previous Flic SDK will have to include a new SDK in order to support Flic 2 LR. As a developer, there are a lot of options for you if you want Flic to work for your application. If you have an app, we recommend to include the Flic 2 App SDK which will be available natively for iOS and Android. If you want to develop applications for the Flic Hub, we� will soon release the Flic Hub Javascript SDK. As usual, there are SDKs and connectivity daemons for other platforms such as Linux and Windows. No license fees Use any official Flic software for free, most under the Creative Commons (CC0) license. Internet connection not required Previously, Flic products have required an internet connection in the Bluetooth pairing process. But not any longer! (Dear NASA, we can fulfill your request from 2016 now!) Open communication specification If you want Flic 2 to connect to other hardware devices, we have some good news for you: the Flic 2 Bluetooth communication protocol is open. Meaning that if you don�t want to use our SDKs and daemons, you don�t have to! Write your own protocol implementation using our guidelines and best practices and you can integrate Flic into literally any hardware running Bluetooth Low Energy. Our old Flic SDKs (yes, we�ve had two) were littered with restrictions and limitations as a result of decisions that were made when we designed the first Flic back in 2014. This time we have re-worked everything and combined all the good stuff into one SDK that's truly built with openness in mind. It�s easier to set up and integrate, it has multi-app support, fewer restrictions and it�s more reliable! Multi-app support With Flic 2�s new architecture, you can connect multiple apps to the same Flic, which opens up a whole new world of possibilities. This means that we are no longer restricted to using one app for one Flic for a single task. Now you�ll be able to combine a flurry of apps to create your perfect workflow. Flic Marketplace To kickstart the ecosystem of Flic 2 enabled apps we�ll introduce a Flic Marketplace. This is where people share app ideas and find other apps that do just the right thing. Here you can request features not only to us but to an entire army of developers! Smart Phones are great, but if you want to create solutions that aren�t dependant on a smartphone being around, something that always just works, then the Flic Hub SDK is for you. The Flic Hub SDK with a super easy-to-use programming environment lets you write code directly on the Flic Hub! No Tools Required We wanted to make coding on the Flic Hub accessible to everyone. All you need to get started is a Flic Hub and a web browser, no additional software is needed! Simply log in through our developer portal and connect to our web-based development environment. Start live coding directly on the hub within minutes! JavaScript API We created an easy JavaScript API that takes care of all the complicated parts and lets you focus on Your Ideas. However, if you want to get technical, there are advanced, low-level APIs as well. Share Your Work When you're done you can, of course, share your work to let other people take advantage of your awesome ideas! Large Scale Deployment For businesses that want to use the Flic Hub in custom solutions at scale, we offer a Device Management platform that lets you push applications to hubs in your domain instantly. Zero Setup We are also working on a Device Management Platform for large scale deployments of the Flic Hub. For Hubs in the Device Management Platform, there will be an ability to Cloud Configure Hubs. This means that you can assign new Hubs to specific configurations and ship them directly to customers without ever having to open the box. When the client plugs in power and Ethernet, the Hub will fetch its configuration and set itself up automatically. If you are interested in the Device Management Platform let us know and we can sign you up on a pre-release. If you have an app, a product or a web service that can be enhanced with Flic buttons, you can monetize on your user base by providing information about Flic or selling Flics that have your logo. We can take care of the entire chain from the point of sale until delivery to your customers. Get in touch with our sales team to find out more! We take your privacy very seriously, and that�s not just something we say. With Flic 2, we have changed our mindset. When we created the original Flic, we wanted to collect data in order to individualize and improve the experience for our users, but that�s not how we see it now. We don�t want your data anymore. With our products today and in the future, you can feel safe in that we know nothing about you or about how you use your Flic buttons. We still collect anonymized statistics in the apps so that we can spot bugs and so we can see which functions are popular and not. You can read our current Privacy Policy here, however, we are constantly improving it. This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them."

His father is a drunk that shows barely any signs of life, while his mother is a clean freak, caring more about a clean home than her son. The only comfort Ben finds is in his notebook, when he is drawing out pictures of his imaginary friend and protector, Mr Sweets.

She connects with the world through art, especially in drawing characters with only one eye. Art has become the key to unlocking the door between Sylvia, a girl who has a mentality of a 3-year-old stuck inside the body of a 14-year-old, and her mom Katherine, a woman who has overcome life struggles including multiple divorces, domestic violence, and jail sentence yet never given up on offering unconditional love to her autistic daughter. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that affects a person�s communication and behaviors. It affects over 2 million people in the U.S. and tens of millions worldwide. Autism is a lifelong condition and we still don�t have a medical cure for it. Finding appears to reflect a lack of screening of ASD in minority communities. Furthermore, this documentary explores the issue of autism in girls. The criteria for diagnosing ASD are based on data derived almost entirely from studies of boys. The main subject of this film � Sylvia, is a multiracial girl with ASD. Sylvia, now 14 years old, was diagnosed with autism since age 3. Sylvia demonstrated her artistic talents at a very young age with her first drawing when she was only 3 years old. While having speaking and learning difficulties, art was Sylvia�s outlet to the world. Sylvia�s vibrant and often unique drawings say loudly, what words otherwise fail to tell. Sylvia�s artworks with bright colors, unique shapes and one-eyed characters provide us with a glimpse into her imaginative and inventive mind. She now lives with her mom and two sisters in Los Angeles. Katherine Yu (age 56) is an author and scriptwriter, but she always describes herself as an autism mom first. Katherine considers ASD as a gift for her child. 30 years ago, She applied to multiple grad schools oversea after having her first child Jenny in China. She received full scholarship to come to study in USA. It was during the 90s, while most women in China were playing the role of a housewife, Katherine never stopped improving herself academically. She went through two broken and abusive marriages while raising three daughters on her own. Katherine portrays strength, patience and heart love through her struggles and hard work both as an independent woman and as an extraordinary mom. Alina is Katherine�s second daughter. Alina is 2 years older than Sylvia and they were born to the same parents. Alina and Sylvia share a wonderful sisterhood. One of Sylvia�s greatest habits is to put makeup on Alina. Sylvia loves to �create art� on Alina�s face and turn Alina into one of the abstract characters she draws. These two girls still draw together in the same room on the same table everyday. Jenny was born in China and currently 33 years old. Jenny moved to USA to live with Katherine after her parents got divorced. Jenny is 19 years older than Sylvia. Even though Jenny and Sylvia don�t share the same father, they still share the closest sisterhood. Jenny now lives with her sisters and mom. She now works in the office with minimal wages in order to have flexible spare time to take care of Sylvia. Jenny has promised Katherine that she will not have her own child as she will treat Sylvia as her own child in the future when Katherine passes away. Family Photo One Eye Characters Sylvia started to connect with the world through drawing and painting at age 3. Sylvia�s pieces have evolved to contain unique one-eyed characters that exist within the fantastical and beautiful worlds she creates. Her artworks have never been seen by the rest of the world and as such, we would like to hold an art exhibition for Sylvia to showcase her extraordinary and unique craft to her community and the world for the very first time. This event is extremely important for Sylvia�s family; it will serve as a release and celebration for these lovely, headstrong four women to continue fighting and dreaming for their coming future.

Sound Designer Colin Ren Hailing from northeastern China, Colin never dreamt of expressing himself through film. Yet the art of sound and moving images became the place he felt most comfortable and understood. Colin has always been in awe of the way sound works with our unconsciousness, and he hopes to use its power to help the world connect with Sylvia in this film. He previously studied Studio Art at Colgate University, with a concentration in video art and installation. Sound Designer Jiashu Li Jiashu was born and raised in Wuhan. He received his dual degrees in both Film Production and New Media Art at Penn State. In the USC Graduate Film School, he found his passion in sound design and he hopes to contribute his vision and creativity to this emotional piece. I have always been fascinated by all the differences exist in this world that make us unique individuals. Sylvia�s story offers faith to individuals who struggle with being �different� as well as connects us to a new dimension of possibilities beyond the appearance of disabilities. This film will showcase that autism is as much a part of humanity as is the capacity to dream unlimitedly. Sylvia shows us beauty beyond the normal. Ultimately, this is a film that celebrates differences and diversities and reflected on the infinite power of a pure heart. This documentary will be created in the poetic style in which special intensity is given to the expression of feelings and emotions by the use of distinctive visual style and emotional rhythm. I am more interested in emphasizing visual elements to evoke emotional responses from the audience, motivate the audience to involve more and lead them to understand an �inner truth� of the story. I would like to tell Sylvia�s story as a visual poetry as she is indeed an artist herself. I will visualize the distorted and blurring reality inside Sylvia�s brain where words held no meaning. The ultimate goal is to capture the complexity, fragility and wonder of an autistic girl�s world and recreate her lifelong struggles of living with autism. I will make the visual experience authentic and comprehensible for the audience who wouldn't understand what autism really means."

THANK YOU FOR HELPING US REACH OUR GOAL! We're so excited we get to make this film for you. Stay tuned to imgeorgelucas.com for future updates. PROJECT BACKSTORY Connor Ratliff, a 40-something comedian in New York City, has been playing the iconic role of George Lucas for the past five years at the famed Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (albeit primarily at midnight on Fridays in the satellite East Village space). The show � titled �The George Lucas Talk Show� � didn�t have much hope for success. The premise that filmmaker George Lucas � now retired and without ownership of his Star Wars franchise � would use his free time to start a late night talk show was ultimately a very geeky and niche idea. Bringing that concept to life alongside his CGI creation Watto all while interviewing illustrious guests, commenting on the new trilogy, and reflecting on his past work, raised the show to another level (though Connor would often blurt out mid-performance that it could be cancelled by the UCB Artistic Director at any moment). And yet, it is one of the theatre�s longest-running shows, bringing out a pretty amazing batch of guests (Jon Hamm, D�Arcy Carden, Wyatt Cenac, Janeane Garofalo, David Harbour, Nicole Byer, and so many more) as well as a dedicated and loving audience every month, and is now featured at the main space in Hell�s Kitchen at the prime 7:30pm Friday slot. With write-ups in the Village Voice, special performances at New York Comic Con and SXSW, and a filmed segment on a TV sketch series, �The George Lucas Talk Show� and Connor Ratliff have become beloved fixtures in the New York comedy scene. And yet, the show is put together every month by only three people � Connor (THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK, SEARCH PARTY, DON'T THINK TWICE, THE DISCOVERY), his producer and talent booker Patrick Cotnoir (Marvel Entertainment, THE CHRIS GETHARD SHOW, UCB's ASSSSCAT), and co-star Griffin Newman (Amazon's THE TICK, Showtime's OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT, BLANK CHECK podcast) � who have to handle the set design, costumes, guest booking, prizes, video production, music cues, and ideation of general topics to be discussed, all while juggling their own full-time jobs, other creative endeavors, and personal lives. As some of those dedicated and loving fans of the show, we�ve been fascinated by how it all comes together every month while always feeling fresh and funny. And because we get to spend so much time with �George Lucas�, we don�t often get to see much of the man behind the white beard, Connor Ratliff himself. As filmmakers ourselves, we felt there was a story behind the comedy show about one of history�s greatest storytellers, and wanted to uncover more about Connor�s empathetic portrayal of him, what it was that motivated him to create this show, and how he�s kept it running for this long (with no end in sight). Thus, we present to you our film, I'M ""GEORGE LUCAS"": A CONNOR RATLIFF STORY. PRODUCTION TIMELINE April-August 2019: Filming with Connor, Patrick, Griffin, friends and past guests of the show, and capturing three of the performances September-December 2019: Post production 2020-2021: Film festivals and wide distribution WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS �The George Lucas Talk Show� is a show that brings much joy to its creators as well as its fanbase. Tons of friendships have been formed by show-goers over the past several years, and it even inspired a pair of friends to concoct a bingo game to be played during the show because of their obsession with Connor�s bits, which has now spread to become a fixture for the entire audience. We wanted to match this passion by all involved in creating a film that captures this, while also revealing more to the world about what goes into making it. We believe there is more than what is obvious and apparent, and want to explore the psychology and trajectory of Connor and how it correlates to George himself, as well as the complicated fandom around George and his creations. WHO THIS FILM IS FOR This film is for all those interested in a human story about those in the spotlight and those who go overlooked, and what drives each of them and the resulting art they each produce. It�s for fans of comedy, fans of Star Wars, fans of cinema history, fans of human stories, and fans of the documentary medium. WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO The money that you are so generously donating to us goes towards paying for the equipment we are presently covering out of pocket, as well as the upcoming post-production and advertising costs, to get this film to look and sound as awesome as possible and be seen by as many of you as possible. All of what we raise will go towards covering the production costs of making a documentary, and to support the film in its journey towards distribution. WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT We have put together a fine team of filmmakers to capture and shape this project into a compelling documentary, but we can�t do it alone! We�re regular people struggling with daily life in New York City, and unfortunately that means not having a lot of extra funds to cover our artistic ambitions and endeavors. We could really use the support from YOU, our welcomed visitor to this page, to help us make and finish the film. Any amount you can contribute to our production fund would go a very long way in seeing this film reach the finish line of production, and even more so to reach the eyeballs of audiences worldwide. We�ve put together a vast list of rewards that are super fun and valuable, that we hope will also be of encouragement towards your donation. Additionally, whether you can financially support us or not, we�d LOVE for you to help spread the word about this film to your social networks, as word-of-mouth is often the best arbiter of success. Please post this Kickstarter link to your social channels, and also follow our own handles on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for updates and bonus content! DIRECTOR'S NOTE � Ryan Jacobi Over the last few years, The George Lucas Talk Show has become a low-cost therapy. No matter what chaos might be going on in the outside world, inside the walls of the UCB Theater, Connor Ratliff�s hilarious take on George Lucas offers a mix of absurdist, yet sincere, entertainment along with a sense of genuine joy. It exists for an hour, enjoyed by a cult-like following, then disappears, only to re-emerge a month later. Attempting to understand Connor is fascinating. Why has he pretended to be George Lucas for more than 5 years? How and why does he utilize a mainstream figure to express his own story? What does he get out of doing this show for free? It�s too enticing to ignore. After only a few months of filming, it has been surprising and rewarding to witness Connor as a performer and a person, along with his band of talented collaborators. Already, the universal subjects of success and failure, grappling with the past, and learning to live in the moment are begging to be explored. Thank you for considering to back this project. It is my intention that, like Connor himself, the film will be fun, unique, and sincere. With your help, we�ll be able to realize this story�s full potential and create a little more space for absurdity and joy. CONNOR'S NOTE Ryan & Marsh originally approached us (me & Patrick) about wanting to properly film one of our monthly shows, possibly with some kind of comedic framing device. That initial conversation led us to decide to allow them into our actual process in the hopes that something like that might be interesting to watch, a snapshot of a strange NYC-based comedy talk show that has found its level as a well-regarded but peculiar cult comedy event. I think if I wasn't the one doing this show, I might be curious to see a film about it, especially if I was in a part of the country or the world where I was unable to attend the show in person. My hope is that this film will convey what GLTS is and what it tries to be, and that we end up looking good. Then again, a lot of great documentaries betray their subjects and make them look like fools. Please give some money to this Kickstarter and let's find out which kind of doc this ends up becoming! THE STRETCH GOAL The funds we�re raising will cover the minimum costs of production and post (such as color grading, sound mix, master, and original music composition), so that no expense will come out of pocket. Anything we can raise beyond that will go to more ambitious production and post, as well as covering additional film festival submissions and advertising.

Balanswing is the compression shirt made specifically for the golfer. Strategically positioned silicon strips integrated into the Mipan Aqua-X performance textile provide tension in all the right areas, offering subtle suggestions to your arms, shoulders, chest and back to get into a proper golf stance. After four years of research in fabric technologies, bio mechanical analysis of golf swings, and kinematic function studies, Balanswing is ready to help golfers all over the world! Compression fit technology has been favored by athletes of all kinds in many sports. It provides support, helps prevent injury, protects your skin, keeps you warm, etc�. However, golf requires specific movements not always conducive to what�s currently on the market. Balanswing is specifically engineered for the golfer, providing all the benefits of compression shirts with almost none of the drawbacks. Regardless of what you might look like in a form fitting shirt, your swing is gonna look great! Much like the Kenesio tape that is used by elite athletes all over the world, the elastic silicon strips strategically embedded throughout the Balanswing shirt work as gentle reminders to get you into proper positions as you swing. The strips are not forceful enough to restrict you, but they have just enough tension to provide awareness. Horizontal strips across the back and chest promote and support proper postures throughout the swing. Vertical strips running down the back provide support for the back and core muscles. Arm and shoulder seams are cut specifically to help position the arms more forward of the body to promote solid �connection� in the swing, where the arms and body work together. The only thing you'll need to remember is to put it on.

Balanswing is a more natural solution that provides constant reminders of proper form and technique. And try wearing that straight jacket on the fairway- people will think you're insane, Balanswing is made for anywhere you play golf, including on the golf course. It's not just for practicing on the driving range. The UV protection and moisture wicking material helps keep you cool in warm weather. Balanswing is not a training aid, it�s intelligent sportswear!

We'll send out a survey at the end of the campaign asking for size and color. In case you order a wrong size, we offer one FREE EXCHANGE.

Established in 2014, Balanswing is a fruit of four years of labor of love by our team. We had a huge break-through when Hyosung, a leading textile manufacturer in Korea, became our partner.

Download the PDF Preview For a thousand thousand years, an ancient entity has been trapped in the heart of a mountain formed from rock not of this world. Over eons, creatures both monstrous and intelligent have explored the endless tunnels, caverns, and chambers of Blackclaw, answering the call of the mysterious entity buried within it. Over long centuries, hundreds of lairs, cities, keeps, prisons, and tombs were established within the mountain, but even those centuries of exploration did not uncover all its secrets. Then, two centuries ago, the entity now known as the Grendleroot awoke. Indestructible black spires shot through the rock of the mountain like the roots of a deadly weed, shattering civilizations, burying cities, and exposing caverns long lost. Today, adventurers residing in Deepdelver�s Enclave explore these lost ruins once again. They seek fellow adventurers brave enough to answer the call of Blackclaw, and to seek the mysteries of the Grendleroot. Ruins of the Grendleroot is a book of ten short easy-to-run adventures for the fifth edition of the world�s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. Designed for characters of 1st to 5th level, these adventures take place in the caverns, chambers, tunnels, and ruins of the mountain known as Blackclaw, within which lurks the Grendleroot�a strange and otherworldly sentience. Across these ten adventures, your characters will cure the corruption of an old tower destined to bring daylight to the cavern of Shadowreach; rescue a lost child who answers the call of a dying god; seek out the source of a plague of gnome zombies; travel to the Forest of Iron to stop the priest who would destroy the Grendleroot�and the entire mountain surrounding it; protect Deepdelver's Enclave from marauding warbands of orcs and hobgoblins; find the beast lurking in abolethic ruins that promises salvation in return for fresh meat; seal up a damaged cell in a forgotten monastery, which contains a being so dangerous that even its thoughts can kill; save a war hero from the elven assassins who hunt her down; discover the secret to quieting the restless Grendleroot from a slumbering vampire archmage; and travel to the Black Cathedral, discover the origin of the mysterious Caretakers, and stop a mage attempting to capture the power of the Grendleroot for herself. Download the free PDF preview�including summaries of all ten adventures and a fully playable 1st-level adventure you can run today! Ruins of the Grendleroot focuses on the sense of mystery and wonder that comes from exploring ancient ruins. The central hub of these adventures, Deepdelver's Enclave, is a frontier outpost overlooking the ruined city of Shadowreach, set deep within the mountain. In Deepdelver's Enclave, adventurers and explorers recount tales of their explorations, trade treasure and artifacts, and enjoy their shared love of uncovering the mysteries of the mountain. These ten adventures can be run independently as single-session games of roughly two to four hours each, or they can be tied together as part of a larger campaign. Five of the adventures can be combined together into a five-session mini campaign that focuses on the strange consciousness lying at the center of the mysterious mountain. Each of these ten adventures is designed to get you up and running quickly and to help you integrate them into your own campaign. If you�re familiar with the format of the book Sly Flourish�s Fantastic Adventures and the concepts in the book Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master, the setup of these adventures will be familiar to you. Even if you aren�t, you�ll find the design of these adventures intuitive and straightforward.

HIVE QUEEN and COUNTRY Oh Son's of England; for the first time since the Armada was driven from our shores an enemy has invaded our homeland. The Nation is in peril!The Enemy is most foul. However, we shall persevere; we shall avenge the Duke of Cambridge and Exeter.Arise Son's of England; the enemy is there and we shall drive the vermin from our sacred shores! Welcome to the Hive, Queen and Country universe as envisioned by Terry Sofian and the members of the Hivequeen Yahoo! group. Hive, Queen and Country is set in a modified Victorian history with a number of �conceits�; technologies that are added to increase the excitement of an already fascinating era. Changes include economically viable space travel to Luna, Mars and Venus, as well as widespread heavy life air flight. The new worlds of the solar system are not lifeless orbs but are spheres populated with strange and dangerous life. A race of aliens inhabits Mars and has used enslaved humans to terraform that world, Venus is also home to transplanted Earthers. And in 1892 giant ""BUGS"" invade England in Devonshire. Thus in this universe ""Tommy"" will not only face Zulus and Dervishes, but alien invaders and exotic creatures on Venus and Mars. Luckily for our ""Tommy"" weapons technology is advancing rapidly under the influence of alien technology and the pressure to defend the homeland. Why do we need your support?In July 2013 we formed Rosa Miniatures and Games to develop miniatures for the Hive Queen and Country universe using the latest technology 3D printing.This technology provide more details and permits overhanging parts, thus you will receive ""bugs"" of exceptional quality. Since the Hive Queen and Country universe is played as both a table top war-game (Hive and the Flame) and as a role-playing game (Stars of Empire), our miniature line for this game will be produced in both 15mm and 25mm. At this time we need your help to move for development into production. THE HIVE When The Hive broke out into Devon and Cornwall in the spring of 1891 it was a threat of unknown nature and capabilities. In parallel with direct military efforts designed to contain and destroy the aliens scientists worked to study and understand them. Initially humans were able to dissect the remains of individual Hive animals and make observations about their physiology. Increased contact with the aliens brought additional data about their life cycles, both of the individual workers, warriors, queens and kings and the Hive super-organism itself. Through the entire Hive War the aliens continuously bred new warriors of increasing size and capabilities, the ability to identify these new castes became critical. Like a human society the Hive is far more than the sum of its parts and the behavior of the entire colony is what in the final analysis made the Hive such a deadly opponent. Like terrestrial social insects the members of the Hive are divided into castes, groups whose bodies are designed to fulfill certain functions within the Hive structure. The Queen herself, and her King are members of the reproductive caste. The vast majority of Hive individuals are workers and these perform a variety of functions, from building the Hive to caring for eggs and the Queen to harvesting, growing or transporting resources. The Hive is defended and territory gained by the warrior caste; the warriors; are designed to fight the enemies of the Hive and bring them back as food. Drones are needed to control workers and warriors, without these individuals other Hive members do not cooperate effectively. Renderings of bugs The worker and warrior castes are further subdivided. The worker caste consists of many types from nursemaids, to diggers to tumblebugs. The warriors are by far the most individually specialized. There are almost twenty known types of warriors in several different sub-castes. Each type has different functions and each deserves to be described on their own. Drone (rendering) The warrior caste has a large number of sub-castes. The following sub-castes have been identified: Lancers, Soldier, Legionaries, and Shooters. Within each sub-caste there are four growth stages: sizes of warrior from the numerous minors to the rare but terrifying super-majors. Each sub-caste has its own tactical role to play on the battlefield. Legionaries are the most generalized of the warrior castes and are often used as scouts. They slash their enemies with mantis like appendages causing gaping wounds.

They are biological volley guns, cannons, rockets or bombs. Medium and smaller shooters use the power of compressed air to launch volleys of quills. The Shooter Major and super major produce chemicals within their bodies that when mixed fire heavy projectiles from a tube on their abdomen. Renderings of Shooters: not scaled Workers: PICKERS and HAULERS Every hive has a wide variety of worker bugs that collect food and maintain the hive. The Hauler is a the Bug-Truck moving resources where ever directed: . It is often encounters outside the hive. The Picker is a general worker which was named by humans because the often encounter it collecting (picking) food. Rendering of Pickers and Haulers The KILLERS are the fifth warrior class we designed, but we are having issues with printing these as the tentacles that rise off the abdomen are rather fragile. This is the reason we have not yet added them to this Kickstarter: we do send out bad models. The experiments continue. Renderings of Killer Warrior Caste What Rules Can I use? What game system cannot use giant insectiods? These high quality miniatures can be used with any game system. Of course we do think our rules are the best, but then again we are a little bit bias. Stars of Empire (by Terry Sofian) Stars of Empire is a hard science science fiction role playing game in which the Victorian Powers have discovered space flight and are striking out across the vast darkness of interplanetary space. As they explore frontiers on Earth, Luna, Mars and Venus, they encounter transplanted populations of humans, ancient and terrible alien races, and ferocious exotic beasts. Until 1892 each considered the other Great Powers to be their biggest rivals. It was in that year The Hive broke free in Devon and threatened more than just the balance of power on Earth. The Hive put the very existence of mankind at stake. The Victorian in Our Time Line was a period of exploration and scientific achievement, military conflict and colonial conquest and social upheaval. In Stars of Empire aerial and space travel have been cleverly grafted into this historical fabric. Players will be able to interact on not only Earth but other worlds as well. Mars is home to a race of ancient aliens, powerful dangerous and unpredictable to the minds of men. Their true powers and purposes are shrouded in mystery. It is know that for many thousands of years they have harvested humans from Earth for use as slaves. With this human workforce Mars has been transformed from a lifeless rock into a tropical greenhouse of a world. Venus, beneath its thick atmosphere is a strange mix of dark basalt plains and humid cloud forests. Stars of Empire is a stand alone game book. It contains the core role playing rules, and a detailed and dangerous universe setting. Rules include character generation, combat and detailed sections allowing characters to develop engineering projects, scientific theories or inventions. Hive and the Flame (by Terry Sofian) BEST SCIENCE FICTION GAME SUPPLEMENT 2011! as voted by the membership of The Miniatures Page. In The Hive and the Flame, alien invaders meet the thin red line of the British army. Using the well-tested Sword and the Flame British colonial game engine and Eight Hundred Fighting Englishmen's mechanics for larger scale battles, The Hive and The Flame brings in the alien arthropods from Terry Sofian's Hive, Queen and Country setting. Advanced Victorian technology, backed up by the guts of rough British Tommies, faces off against giant arthropods armed with claws and mandibles. Even Zulus and Dervishes can't match the selfless devotion these creatures show to the Hive. Can the humans, with their science and courage, match biological killing machines bred to cleanse a planet of all life? Steam-powered airships and land machines help to even the contest between the alien invaders and the soft, physically weak humans, who are badly outnumbered by the rapidly breeding creatures. Larry Brom's original and inventive rules are smoothly integrated with both the alien menace and steampunk technology. Rules and background are included for numerous insectoid invaders, as well as many new weapons and technologies for the Imperial defenders. The Sword and The Flame and/or Eight Hundred Fighting Englishmen is required to use this product. For more information on the Hive-Queen and Country Universe see:http://hivequeenandcountry.com/home/ Other Rules (Adaptability): What game system cannot use giant insectiods? These high quality miniatures can be used with any game system. Our Steam Land-ships and human troops can be used with any Victorian Sci-fi game. Of course we do think our rules are the best, but then again we are a little bit bias. Investment Plans and Breakdown.

Do you want to print directly from a live folder on your computer? Well we have a perfect solution for you. iPIX is creating a simple way to print using any iPad app through a wired USB connection. This means lighting fast and worry free printing. No AirPrint. No servers. Just straight forward simple printing. This program will also work as a watch folder printing program. Meaning, you select a folder to monitor and, any files added into it, will get printed automatically. If you are using an iPad app then this method would still require the use of a cheap PC since iPads don't allow for driver installation. However, a cheap $100 tablet will be perfectly fine as its only function is to send a photo to the printer. The process will be simple. 1. Connect your iPad to your computer 2. Open the printing program and select the album on your iPad that you want to monitor. 3. Select automatic or manual printing. 4. Select a watched folder (where the files will go into). 5. Press Start Program 6. Watch the files print. You will also have and option to manually reprint a file if you want to. Simply select the thumbnail of the file, select number of copies, and press reprint photo."

The Short Backstory As a father I've tried to cultivate curiosity in our kids and help them to discover what they are good at. My son Abner is getting to an age where earning some extra $$$ is important, so the topic of getting a job has been part of our regular conversations. I'm all for hard work and craftsmanship, but I'm not for trading the precious hours of our life, doing work that has no enduring value, for a few bucks. To me, creativity is a gift and should be cultivated throughout life. The world doesn't need anymore plastic widgets, efficiently built by human automatons, destined for landfills and waterways. Abner loves camping - for his 16th birthday we went on a mini road trip around Washington state hiking and building campfires (he also loves to ride his skateboard, but that's a whole different topic). Shirts are something we wear everyday - so they seemed like the perfect way to help him understand that there are many ways that creativity and art can enable him to earn money. The design is a sketch he made for his mother that shares his love of camping. $25 Reward - Abner's sketch on a super comfortable shirt. Adventure shirts. The message is simple - adventure is...out there! We just have to be willing to go look for it. For Abner this shirt will be an adventure; he'll get to learn a little about apparel and screen printing, but most importantly I hope he learns that creativity can provide him with a way to earn a living without selling out or being relegated to a life of mindless drudgery. He doesn't know about this Kickstarter project (yet) - my hope is that I can surprise him with a modest number of orders, so he'll see the potential and do more. $5 Reward - Abner's sketch on a heavy weight postcard. Adventure postcards."

The 1st Annual Gay Show is a brand new dance theatre work written by Colby Calhoun and William Acker and choreographed by Danielle Georgiou and created in collaboration with the ensemble. The 1st Annual Gay Show will premiere at the Festival of Independent Theatres at the Bath House Cultural Center and will perform on the following dates: - Friday July 12th @ 8PM - Saturday July 13th @ 5PM - Sunday July 14th @ 5PM - Saturday July 20th @ 2PM - Saturday July 27th @ 8PM - Thursday August 1st @ 8PM ---- Why are we making this show? The 1st Annual Gay Show is dance theatre for queer people made by queer people. Our show focuses on the complex experiences of queer people of color living in America and we are devoted to showcasing queer excellence outside of the lens of social norms or popular culture. Queer people, and queer POC especially, are too often portrayed as simply fabulous and fun and their stories are used as a means of entertainment, but in this show we want to show a more wholistic perspective of the queer experience. We want to share not only joy and fabulosity, but also success, failure, talent, shame, and pride. ---- What is the show? The 1st Annual Gay Show is a spectacle filled piece of verbatim dance theatre that both pulls directly from and abstracts the format of a traditional southern beauty pageant while dissecting the ideas of queer visibility, diversity and inclusion, and the role that outward vanity plays in the queer identity. The 1st Annual Gay Show pushes past the surface level of simply including trans and queer people of color and instead brings their stories, and unique experiences, to center stage and pulls back the curtain (puns intended) to reveal the nasty truth behind the smiles, the glitz, and the glamour. ---- Why do we need your help? We are a brand new group and because of that we lack the funds to be able to produce this show on our own. Thankfully, our show is one of eight works chosen for the Festival of Independent Theatres at the Bath House Cultural Center this year. FIT alleviates much of the financial burden by providing a performance space, marketing, and unique festival that exposes us to a wide audience. However, costuming, props, and most importantly paying our artists is up to us. This is why we need your help! A donation to our campaign helps us continue to make theatre like The 1st Annual Gay show and your donations directly goes to supporting queer and trans artists of color! Help us reach our goal of $2000. Funding is all-or-nothing so it's imperative we reach this goal. We want give our performers a well deserved stipend for their fierce talents, time, and dedication. We need you and your support, for you to spread the word of our show, and then please come see it! We can�t wait to see you there!

I am a full time senior at San Francisco State University, majoring in Sociology, while also being a full time bank teller. I am trying to launch a mobile app designed to help all people of color choose a health care provider that's perfect for them. If you are a person of color, you know that mental health isn�t treated appropriately in our community, in fact it�s usually ignored. Especially for the generations before us. The topic has carried particularly negative connotations. Unfortunately, it's easier to talk about drug or alcohol addiction than depression or anxiety. But in the past decade, the attitude regarding mental health within our communities is slowly changing and the acceptance of therapy is rising. As a person of color myself, I know that we tend to distrust medical professionals. But what if you could speak to someone who looks like you, has had similar life experiences, or has the same cultural background? With this app, I plan to join forces with health care providers with the intention to make people of color more open and comfortable. The goal is to not only help people find a health care provider perfect for them, but to also create an open and honest space where we don�t have to be ashamed or embarrassed to speak our truth. The overall goal is to de-stigmatize, normalize, and most importantly PRIORITIZE mental health. There are millions of people with a mental illness who are getting treatment and living successful lives. Help me help others join them and take control of their health. Below our a couple samples."

Chapter 2: The Red Lady of Babylon The robbers escape by stealing Senator Valerian's sailing ship, only to discover a prisoner aboard named Marcus, who knows how to reveal the Red Lady's message, and a scroll from Macedon which explains it.

BOOK PRINTING SPECS: � 12 pt matte UV cover � 80 lb matte coated interior pages � 6.25""x8.574"" at 128 pages The more pre-orders we receive, the lower the cost of each book becomes. This in turn allows us to invest those savings back into the length of the book itself. KYRIE Part II: The Three Sand Seas is also complete - meaning a further 120 pages can be added to this book, but we need a higher pre-order count to afford to thicken this book run.

THE ALBUM When I began this album last summer I was skeptical if the joy of music-making still resided within me. You see, this album was born in fire and hardened in tension and silence, and those are hard lessons to own. In April 2016, I woke to shouts and sirens and the dim flicker of firelight on the tree outside my window. While I lay sleeping, a mere 10 feet above my head a faulty HVAC unit caught fire. There was enough time to run outside with my phone and keys. Despite the frantic chaos of firemen running up and down the stairs and the orange, hungry flames and the black smoke blotting out the stars and the worried neighbors calling out for missing pets and the TV crew that materialized by our cars and the Red Cross blanket wrapped tightly around me, I heard music. The Sycamores Apartment fire. That's my KIA and two windows above her is my bedroom. Hymns and folk songs weaved in and around me like that Red Cross blanket. My world was burning, and my mind played songs. Such is the power of what we say and write and play and share with one another, and such is what I have attempted to create and share with you in this album. Young American Sycamore is a testament to faith that withstands doubt. It reflects upon the importance of re-evaluating boundaries, and welcomes grieving and rejoicing alike. My belief in these songs is bolstered by the unwavering support so many of you have offered, even from the earliest years. You have encouraged me to keep writing, to keep singing, to keep telling stories. It is this encouragement I am calling upon now to financially support Young American Sycamore. The happiest place in the world (spoiler: it's not Disney) THE COST Albums are not inexpensive endeavors, but at least there's not some big wig producer saying ""the only cure for [his] fever is more cowbell"". Creating an independent album allows me complete artistic freedom to bring these songs to life in the way I envision them. It is a strange dichotomy of empowerment and humility to be an independent artist. Some albums are fully funded beforehand while others (like mine) go full steam ahead on credit and attempt to recoup the loss at a later time. I personally funded my first album out of a bootstrap-pulling mentality and I missed out on the feverish anticipation and build up that comes from a crowdsourced album funding and release! Simply put, I missed out on you. The band gathered in the room with the man behind the curtain, Producer Don Bates Now I am asking you to join with me in the excitement and fervor! With your support, I am hoping to raise a total of $15,000. It seems unthinkable to me to ask for that amount, let alone any money. But if I have learned anything through this process, it is that we depend on each other for support in all things. With that being said, here is the breakdown, including the fees Kickstarter takes off the top. MAIN GOAL: $9000 * Engineering, Producing, Mixing, Mastering, and Session players: $5400 *CD replication: ~$350 *Promo videos, photos, and graphics: $1400 *Publicity for the first single release in June: $1500 STRETCH GOAL: $6000 *Publicist for second and third single releases (July, August) and album release (Sept). Publicity will give this album the shot Days Like Tonight never had - a wider audience and a platform. Together with Mike Gowen at Milestone Publicity, I believe the singles and the album will be fully represented and given the chance to shine. Who knows, I may even snag a Spotify playlist! Thank you for your love and support always! xo LP"

The Chimp With The Brown Hat is a Science-Fiction Western trilogy of graphic novels about a chimpanzee who wakes up in the desert in the Old West circa 1880 with a robotic hand, but no idea of who he is or where he came from. He rides from town to town trying to figure out the mystery of who he is and how he is connected to the space-worms that are attacking the surrounding villages. When we last left our hero he was face to face with the Beeker Boys who were oppressing the people of Lanefare but the stakes are much higher this time. The face of a chimpanzee, the mind of a man, and the heart of an outlaw. Fighting bandits and space-worms in the Old West.

One of the more interesting points of beer history I had come across was ""Reinheitsgebot"" (Purity Order), or commonly known in english as ""The German Beer Purity Law"". The law stated that beer could only be brewed with three ingredients, water, barley and hops (yeast had yet to be discovered). Prior to the law, beer had been brewed by many groups of people for medicinal, spiritual and enjoyment purposes and included all kinds of ingredients, from herbs to hallucinogens. Although the law was oppressive and eliminated many styles and brewing traditions, it also helped to create the beer we know today, specifically the prolific IPA. I was introduced to silkscreen printing when I was 15 and have over a decade of printing, graphic design, photography and illustration experience. About a year ago I started my own printing and graphic design company and began crafting and perfecting several designs I had sketched years ago that are inspired by the ""Reinheitsgebot"" and many personal experiences brewing and enjoying beer. All printing and design work is done in-house with quality as the number one priority. The Goal of the Campaign I currently have 6 original designs ready to print on tee shirts, sweatshirts, koozies, coasters and really anything that's printable! There are always other designs floating around my mind or rough sketches laying about the desk.

She sang and played piano, recorder, flute, and bassoon. My journey as a musician began with my mom, and thanks in large part to her, I�ve been a musician my whole life. But I only began writing my own music in 2011, a couple years after my mom had been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer�s Disease and I returned home to spend time with her. As my mom's disease progressed and other language became difficult, music remained a way we could connect. I spent a lot of time playing guitar and singing with her--she liked to sing Simon & Garfunkel and Carole King and Ray Charles songs with me, leaning in and staring into my eyes as I sang and played. This was our top activity. I�ve written innumerable songs in the past seven years, and helping my mom in her progression with Alzheimer�s and facing the transience of life and loved ones have been preoccupations of mine through this time. Many of the songs on my album explore the emotional landscapes of loss and grief, as well as the hard and important process of healing and transformation. My mom passed away in 2016, the same week I began my masters program in Media Scoring at Brooklyn College. I didn�t intend on making an album of this nature prior to grad school. But as I studied and gained confidence as a musician, it became clear this album was ready to be made! In September of 2017, I partnered with fellow graduate student and music producer Teo Blake, and from demos and demos of songs, we chose the nine original songs for the project and began recording. As a graduate student the last 2.5 years I have contributed music and sound on many different projects, but not a week has passed without working on this album. Now that the project is in its final stages, I want to invite you to connect with this project and support me in the completion of this album. The songs are written and over thirty instrumentalists and singers have been recorded. The big task ahead is to finish mixing the album. Then the album will need to be mastered, which incidentally is the most expensive step in post-production of an album. Finally, we are putting together a record release show in Brooklyn featuring an array of instrumentalists who contributed to the album as well as a summer concert series to take this new work on the road! Your financial contribution and your enthusiasm will help me to accomplish this major undertaking. There�s a lot of work ahead, and I'm energized and ready to do it. Creating this body of work has been an act of love and healing for me. If I have any intention in sharing this music, it's that it can in turn help others process and heal. Thank you for being a part of this project that means so much to me! I can�t wait to finish and share with you my debut full length album that will be Play Beautifully."

Our team set up our own special path to grow URBANUS as never getting old brand. In order to keep this purpose, we always try to search new stuffs such as new way, new style, new try and new technology. For example, we invented waterproof denim pants for ski and snowboard and won many awards from the invention. Our team members have very deep trust to each other and have believed that we are pathfinders for innovation. So, we hope to try another new way of market for customer and our own spirit like we have done so far, volunteer to be a pathfinder for better life. SPECIAL THANKS TO KICKSTARTER For last 15 years, we thought the market system is distorted. The final value of the product is too much over-estimated and bystanders took 70% of the final value. Because of this system, we must bleed manufacturers and staffs for low cost. As soon as we met Kickstarter, we became sure this platform can make the distorted market correct. Specially thanks to Kickstarter. NO MORE DUFF A lot of duffs increase product cost, for example, too complicated distribution channel, riddling result of advertising, too much high level of specs and so forth. In fact, final customers cannot enjoy above outputs from the high cost. So, we decided to cut off all duffs except for essential components. DIRECT COMMUNICATION We don't go to North Pole with those jackets. We only need enough waterproof, water repellent and breath-ability. We don't want to stock inventory in our warehouse and be pressured by sales data. We can offer the best price, better quality and good design after cutting off above not necessary components. THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION AND BEST PRICE This is actually more than enough(the waterproof of umbrella is mostly 3,000mm). We don't allow over-functioned products to increase cost and price. If products have been stocked for a couple of years, those functions have been degraded. I can guarantee less than US$99.00 is the best price for all new products. QUICK TREND CHANGE We have very long argument about color offering. Sure, if you can have many choice, it could satisfy you easier. But it also can be one of very critical reason for cost increase. So, we unavoidably decided to give up color option. Nevertheless, the offered color of black is the most popular, snazzy and easy color for mass customers. We are sure this black can make you look better than any other colors. URBANUS BLACK'S FEATURE URBANUS adopts 3-layered fabric named SMART LAYERED series fabric.

This brand centers around many sacred and meaningful experiences and understandings I've had with religion and faith. It also in the same breath represents a message or symbol of the relentless drive of human nature to never quit and to never give up on what it believes in... The term ""Gods sake"" comes from the old saying ""for gods sake"" usually used in a means to express ones emotion or attitude on a situation as being drastic or dire. You may of heard it uttered by a military commander in some war movie talking over a radio.. Or some coach instructing his or her team on their effort or some romantic drama between a couple trying to work out the mystery of love. Regardless of how you hear it. It always represents the same energy. One of passion and a will to achieve something more...

I'm a writer and artist with my own independent business, and this will be my first Kickstarter! I've been in love with superheroes almost my entire life, always striving to be as good as the ones in movies, comics, and novels. Representation matters, and lately I've only seen a little bit of it when I feel like there needs to be more. That's the main reason I'm starting this project - so I can breathe a little life into an idea that I've had for a long, long time. For a good majority of us, we have felt like we need to hide our true selves away, much like a superhero does with their secret identity. But dressed up as a hero leaves one feeling free and able to do what they feel they're meant to do, while still keeping their 'real life' safe from prying eyes. Even still, there are too few superheroes who have their pride out in the open, and I wanted to make this series that's special and dear to my heart -- superhero masks in the colors of the pride flags for you to wear wherever you wish. Each pin will be roughly 1.5in in size, two metal posts with rubber clutches, and backstamped with my company logo (Rainbow Raven). The metal of the pins will be soft enamel rainbow metal plating, each representing a Pride flag in either color or style, depending on which pin(s) you choose. ***PLEASE NOTE THAT DUE TO MANUFACTURING, THE RAINBOW PLATING WILL LOOK DIFFERENT ON EVERY PIN. THE COLORS WILL ALSO DIFFER DUE TO YOUR SCREEN RESOLUTION. THANK YOU!*** To start out with, the basic pin to unlock will be the standard Rainbow.

OUR STORY... began in Bali working with YKPA Bali Street Kids; an orphanage dedicated to providing necessities and education to children in need. We grew deeper roots when the volcano Gunung Agung awoke and caused thousands of local villagers to evacuate. We pulled together our resources to buy food and supplies for those in need. A year later August 2018 over 2000 earthquakes destroyed Lombok and the Gili Islands (which is home to a majority of our Indo family) so we worked endlessly through social media to promote awareness and raise funds for those who lost everything. While in Lombok we met a group of little girls selling bracelets. We had never seen someone so small hustle so hard and it created mixed feelings of awe and sadness. We had the realization that even though we didn't come from a family with money and sooo many odds against us, we've still been able to smash every goal we've ever dreamt up... and that's simply because opportunity was present. We realized that's exactly our position on this planet... to be the bridge for those who don't have the same opportunity as us simply because of geographical location. BOTTOM LINE... If we as adults have the ability to give a child their childhood back why wouldn't we? That's why we formed the That One Happy Thing Girl Gang (aka we gathered our lil sisters and pinky promised + shook hands that we're now officially biz partners) to produce, sell, and give access to buying the bracelets globally. The thought of all of this... that's our one happy thing."

It only takes 3 wires to connect it with an Arduino or a Raspberry. No need to install libraries. By coping a .WAV file on the SD, you can play music, a prerecorded sentence or combine it with word synthesis. Hardware: Build in 3W speaker amplifier with a trimmer for the speaker volume, an audio line output jack and headphone amplifier. lt also includes a separate trimmer for the headphone volume. A low-pass RC filter is used to cut any high frequency noise. The word synthesis is done with an SAMD21G18 micro controller, running with an Arduino Zero bootloader. You must always power the board with 5v. Text is sent to the board thru USB Serial communication or by UART connection. There is a level shifter so a 5v (Arduino UNO, etc) or a 3.3v (Arduino Zero, Raspberry Pi, etc.) micro controller can be used. Both can work simultaneously. The default serial speed is 9600, but the speed can be changed by editing the file �setup.txt� found in the SD card. In this file you can also change the bit rate (default 22050), the bit resolution (default 8 bits), and the speed of the text (default 100). An error LED is turned on when a word is not found in the SD card. Also there is a test button, so you can hear that the board is working Software: The Text-To-Speech board has an SD card where all the words pronunciation are stored. When a text is sent to the Text-To-Speech board, the word synthesis begins, it quickly finds the words pronunciation in the SD card from your picked language/voice folder and word synthesis for the sentence begins. No need to install any library. Power it up with 5v, connect it by using only one pin (Tx pin) to an Arduino compatible (3.3v or 5v) or a Raspberry Pi and just send your text thru your serial port. On an Arduino UNO connect the board only to Pin #1 (also power the board with 5v). Use a command like Serial.print(�Hello world�); It/'s really that simple. On a Raspberry connect the board only on Pin 8 (power the board with 5v). Use the command ser.write(�Hello world�); On the SD card you can store as many language/voice packages as you need. So far I created 4 packages. 7,000 English words package language using a real human voice from Wikipedia project 20,000 English words by using the software from http://espeak.sourceforge.net 10,000 German words by using the software from http://espeak.sourceforge.net 10,000 French words by using the software from http://espeak.sourceforge.net. The Text-To-Speech board converts number to text on the fly, so if you do a � Serial.print(�The house temperature is 75.4 Fahrenheit�); � , the board outputs the voice �the house temperature is seventy five point four Fahrenheit� You can test the board easily. Just connect the micro USB to a PC and send your text thru the USB port using your Arduino IDE console or any other serial communication program you like. USB port is used to do software updates. Simply use the Arduino IDE (arudino Zero compatible). The code will be open source after the campaign is successful. Make your own SD card If you decide not to add the $12 for the SD card with the two English packages install, you can use your own SD card. Just download the zip file from github, unzip it, and copy the folder to your SD card. You can create your own package, with your own voice by recording a full sentence and/or all the possible words you may need, like the number �one�, �two�, �three�,'ten','hundred'�.."

Brand New Sin forged their own way with blood, sweat, tears and metal and recorded some of the most raw, honest, hard yet melodic rock in the early part of the millennium. Out on the road touring with many peers like Motorhead, Corrosion Of Conformity, Saliva, Breaking Benjamin, SOil, Type O Negative, Clutch, Mushroomhead, The Cult and more, they hit like a bullet in the night with their three guitar attack and booming vocals. Over the years they have opened for artists such as Slash, Godsmack, Dope, Chris Cornell, Deftones, Drowning Pool, Audiovent, Dillinger Escape Plan, and countless others. However, after many years of rocking hard on the road, Brand New Sin eventually parted ways with original members Joe Altier, Brian �Slider� Azzoto and Michael Rafferty. The History of Brand New Sin MEANWHILE IN 2018 In 2018, The Original Members got together. The original members of Brand New Sin got together as old friends, and in the course of an evening, they decided to perform a one night only concert - a show to celebrate the legacy and catalog of songs of the band. This show became the sold out LIVE AT THE LOST show in May of 2019. To a capacity crowd in the famed Lost Horizon Nightclub in Syracuse NY, the original lineup of Brand New Sin burst out onto stage in rare form, performing a brash and thundering two-and-a-half hour show, with 30 songs from the entire history of the band. The show was recorded that night on not only high quality video, but exclusive high quality multi-track recording. Now, BRAND NEW SIN needs your help to produce, master and distribute this legendary, one night only concert. They�ll be producing a double CD and Double DVD of this historic show - and the music will be available for streaming. In addition, the show will be available for streaming through platforms like Amazon Prime. If you can help them raise the funds to do so. Support your metal bands - support this project, and own a living piece of that incredible night. THE REWARDS: We've got (rendering of rewards, final product may differ) The Double CD Live Concert - recorded in Multi-Track Stereo by SubCat studios, and mixed by Brand New Sin, this concert beautifully preserves the aural majesty of the show. Mixed in Stereo and 5.1 sound for the DVD, you can own this concert on both CD and a DVD of the Concert Video. On the DVD there will also be behind the scenes footage, interviews and a whole lot more. The concert will be available for download on iTune, Amazon Music, Spotify and other streaming platforms. In addition, the concert will be available on Amazon Prime Video. The Limited Edition Concert poster features custom artwork, is signed by the band and limited to 100 numbered pieces. The Concert Poster advertises this once in a lifetime reunion show! A piece of the history of Brand New Sin THE TIERS Seven Deadly Sins Look to the right to see all the tiers and their offers.

This is a musical story about a journey to discovery. Twelve years ago, I was invited to collaborate on an album with a dear friend and mentor, Steve Chester. Through that album I discovered that, not only am I a singer, I am a songwriter. This is an album nearly a decade in the making. It's a story of my journey to discover who I am beyond a daughter, a lover, a mother, a sister, a friend... It's for every person who's ever asked if I have an album. It's for every person who's ever encouraged me in my art. It's for my friends and family who have supported me emotionally through the highs and lows of a this type of journey. It's for my daughters. I hope that by watching me on my own journey, they will avoid some of the same pitfalls, and they will begin the discovery of who they are much younger than I did. I hope you learn who you are and how to speak that truth early on so that no one can confuse you along the way. It is for me. It is for the young me I once was who was somehow convinced that she was too loud, too wild, too free. It's for the teenage me who learned that there is not ""one"" me, but many facets and moods. It's for the twenty-something me who climbed into a box to make others more comfortable. It's for the thirty-something year old me, who climbed out of her box, embarked on a journey to rediscover the many facets and moods and to proclaim, ""I am a singer. I am a songwriter. I am a woman. I am loud! I am wild. I... AM...FREE."" This, like all Kickstarter campaigns, will be an ""all or nothing"" campaign. If I don't raise all of the funds, I get none of them. Even before I launch, has been a lot of work involved in preparing for a crowdfunding launch and a crowdfunding campaign. There are photo and video shoots, some early recording and mixing to promote the campaign and the project. I cannot do what I do without the love, prayers, encouragement, and financial contributions of my fans, friends, and family. I am still a full-time mother with several part-time jobs that allow me to invest time in my kids, my music, and my community. This Kickstarter allows you to receive awesome rewards for joining me on this journey to produce this album. From digital downloads of bonus tracks all the way up to private house concerts, these are my way of saying thank you for believing in me and my music. We�ve already been in the studio for several months, so myself, my producer, Daniel Malone, and many of my good friends who are also exceptional musicians are already working toward getting this album out, but I can't finish it without you all. And, to be honest, I don't want to. Whether you've been on this journey with me from the beginning or you're just meeting me (Hi, nice to meet you), I am excited to have you along for the ride. I can't wait to share this with you."

We love playing music for ya'll and don't ever want to stop, but we also want to put out an album for you (and the rest of the world) to listen to outside of our live shows. Having a professionally recorded album is an essential piece of our musical resume that will allow us to take the next step. There are so many great music venues and festivals throughout the Bay that we whole-heartedly believe we should be playing. Being able to record and produce this album will allow us to get our foot in the door at Outside Lands, Hardly Strictly, Bottle Rock, and start opening for bigger bands at The Fillmore, The Great American, Slims, and all the other iconic Bay Area venues. The financial hurdle of recording and producing our first record is a big one, but we believe that with your help we can make this dream of ours come true, and continue to make the music that we love with the people we love. Cost breakdown/Reason for our goal #: Recording studios often cost 60 per hour with recording and mixing time taking upwards of 60-80 hours (~$4500). In addition, Kickstarter applies a 5% fee and there are also additional fees for their payment processors. And we'd just love to be able to provide you shirts and stickers (~$1800). The way Kickstarter works is that, if we don't reach out goal then we don't get any of the money (it goes back to you), and we don't get to release our album. What does that mean? Stakes are high and we hope we can reach our goal of $4500, even though it's less than what some of this might cost. Also, PSA: WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF SHIRTS, so please pledge early to get yours! Thanks in advance for your continued love and support. We love ya'll <3. -- Brief bio (you can read an in depth look at The Quilters below): The Quilters are a difficult to categorize band. From San Francisco, California, the group of multi-instrumentalists combines elements of alt-rock, folk, Americana, and indie-pop, with the band�s horn section bringing out a little blue-eyed soul. The band consists of songwriters Ray and Jerome Porter who regularly rotate between keys, bass, guitar, and vocal harmonies. Devin Pugliese, a fellow surfer and Sunset District loc�, chops it up on bass and percussion. Tim Hunt sings harmonies and plays trombone, Gianluca Bullock plays trumpet and percussion, Aneil Dhillon plays sax, and Joe Grandia is on drums.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 T-Shirt design: Meet the band: I step inside Ray and Jerome Porter�s family home in the Sunset, into a living room that has sun-colored walls and is strewn with instruments, musicians, and two dogs. Ray is belting out the lyrics to a playful song called �Discount Doggo�, named after his recently adopted puppy, while also playing drums�though he�s much more comfortable playing guitar. Lyrics: After we played for a little the lady asks if we want to put you on hold She said he�s only 3 days over 5 months old She explained that your price had dropped from 350 to 175 And baby, that�s right when I knew I needed you in my life Jerome is on bass, Aneil Dhillon plucks at a guitar despite being recruiting to play the sax, and Gianluca Bullock is blasting his trumpet. Missing are drummer and bassist, Devin Pugliese, and Tim Hunt, the band�s trombonist. It�s an intense, yet amusing and humorous music session, and they�re clearly having fun. A multi-instrumental band, it�s obvious the Quilters aren�t afraid to flirt with different instruments. �Ray and I were privileged to grow up with opportunities to play instruments of all kinds. If we wanted to play an instrument, we could,� Jerome tells me in a solemn, grateful tone. �I took cello classes just because I wanted to try it, and there was always a piano, banjo, or guitar lying around. Ray and I were even in handbell choirs. We grew up playing so many instruments that I think it normalized different sounds and made any instrument seem accessible and within reach. To us, a different instrument is just another tool in your music belt.� The Quilters, a San Franciscan native band, are difficult to define. Their music combines elements of alt-rock, folk, Americana, and indie-pop, with the band�s brass section bringing out a little blue-eyed soul. Perhaps it�s unsurprising the band�s musical background is as diverse as their multi-instrumental setup. Ray and Jerome, the band�s primary songwriters, grew up studying classical music, attending piano lessons, and singing in the San Francisco Boys Chorus. At home though, the Porter brothers began writing and practicing music with influence from their dad and older brothers who listened to everything from Bruce Springsteen to Arlo Guthrie; Bob Dylan to Rihanna. �Genre wasn�t really a thing or a topic for us, apart from classical music. If it was good music, it was appreciated in our home,� Ray smiles as he runs his hands over Benny�s stomach, swollen because he just got into an entire bag of dog food. �I mean, I remember getting paid to sing in the opera with the SF Boys Chorus and I took the money and immediately bought a shitty Fender Squier so I could play Green Day covers.� As for the rest of the band: Tim Hunt comes from a classical music background similar to Ray and Jerome. Devin Pugliese from a ska background, Gianluca from a blues and metal background, and Aneil was inspired by musicians like Norah Jones, Michael Jackson, and Lauryn Hill. The band began with Ray and Jerome, the founders and songwriters, and trumpeter Gianluca, a high school friend of Jerome. Then the trio brought on Devin Pugliese, a drummer and bassist, whom they met through the Porter brothers� sister. The brothers met Tim and Aneil through friends of friends and the band uses rehearsals as time to not only perfect songs, but to be creative with friends. The Quilters seem to have grown largely due to personal relationships and friendships, which might contribute to the chemistry and energy they have on stage. The band�s collective respect, kindness, and empathy for one another sits at the forefront of each session. �These guys allow Jerome and me to bare our souls through our song writing in an extremely supportive, non-judgemental way.� Ray pauses for a while before choosing his next words. �It�s such a selfless, empathetic act to take the time and emotional effort to understand someone else�s self-expression and perform it. Take Devin, for example. He�s a great drummer, but sometimes all we want is a kick, tambo, kick, tambo and he�ll do just that. Everyone has a willingness to put their ego on the back-burner for the sake of the song.� It�s clear that the Porter brothers have a vision for the band and the songs they write, but it�s also clear they want everyone to contribute and to have their own vision and creative freedom. �We know Gianluca won�t remember what he writes, but we know it�s going to be beautiful and have crazy energy in our performance, so we let him solo it out,� says Jerome. �And oftentimes, Tim will write entire horn sections to fit in with what we�re doing, and he does it in such a tasteful, engaging way.� They�ve only been playing together for less than a year, but The Quilters have a number of shows around the Bay Area lined up for the coming months at venues like Hotel Utah, Neck of the Woods, and Amnesia. They used to struggle with feeling confident in their music, but after playing around the Bay, they feel more sure of their sound. Through the amount of attention the band pays to each song, how hard they work to perfect each song and its emotional expression, and the fact that their sound isn�t a specific genre, they�re certain no-one else is doing quite what The Quilters are doing. They occupy a fortunate space--most have been able to play music in their own city by living at home�a city with a lot of venues and a lot of young people with disposable income who are either excited about the arts or looking for a distraction. That being said, Ray and Jerome are excited to move out this month and have their own space in the city. It took them awhile to find an affordable place, but it�s two blocks from the beach and the boys can surf whenever they�re not playing music. You can try and catch them out in the water, but you�re more likely to catch them at one of their upcoming shows, or by following them on Facebook and Instagram."

Personally, I watched my mother run multiple side hustles in addition to her full time job. I always dreamed of watching her fulfill her passion and start her own fashion business. For women of color, like myself and my mother, there is really limited support when it comes to starting a business. In addition to lacking resources and direction, women of color get the least amount of venture capital funding (only 1% of funding goes to women of color!!). My Solution The Samantha Ealy Show is my solution. As a young woman of color and an entrepreneur, I want to challenge the perception around homogeneity in entrepreneurship by hosting a talk show that will bring on diverse founders to tell their stories. I�m creating this web series for people like my mother, who always had several side hustles but didn�t know how to start a business. In this series, I will be showcasing diverse entrepreneurs as well as giving viewers a unique opportunity to watch the entrepreneurial process up close and personal as I build a business on the show. I have made it my mission in life to guide others toward self-actualization and self-achievement, and I intend to build The Samantha Ealy Show on the same principles, doing whatever I can to deliver high-quality, up-to-date entrepreneurial advice to my viewers. Interviewing and featuring some of the top diverse figures in entrepreneurship today, my web series is going to shape the way people see their business dreams and plans � and put success within reach for more entrepreneurs than ever before. Who is Samantha Ealy? Samantha is uniquely positioned to host and produce this talk show given her degree in Film & Digital Media from Baylor University, as well as her past experience as an entrepreneur and content creator for Generation Wealthy. In addition to entrepreneurship, Samantha has experience working for Google, IDEO, and an artificial intelligence startup in Mexico. Well-versed in entrepreneurship, Samantha is excited to dive into the topic of diversity in entrepreneurship with the goal of inspiring viewers to start their own businesses. Why I Am Coming to You I love the community that's built in the creation of a production project. With the right team in front and behind the camera, the results can be impactful and remarkable. but creating a web series is also a time consuming, exhausting, and expensive task. My goal through this campaign is to raise $50,000, which allows me $5,000 per episode to cover the costs of studio space, equipment, crew salaries, travel, post-production, transcription, administration, marketing, legal, and other miscellanies. To show my appreciation for your support, I am offering contributors early access to the first season of The Samantha Ealy Show and some exclusive, dinner with the host, Samantha Ealy. Entrepreneurial Knowledge + Execution = Entrepreneurial Success By sharing what I know and bringing in experts, I know that I can put long-term business success within my viewers' reach. My goal, first and foremost, is to make a difference in people's lives, and with that, you will be helping me when you contribute to this campaign. Go ahead and spread the word about The Samantha Ealy Show with all your friends and family too. I appreciate your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and I thank you for taking the time to read about what I am doing."

Most perish from stroke (34%), heart disease (26%) and chronic pulmonary disease (22%). Pneumonia and lung cancer account for 12% and 6% of deaths, respectively. Women and young children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth, are particularly vulnerable. More than 50% of pneumonia deaths among children under 5 are linked to household air pollution. We expect PiCO Home to be used mainly at home (power plug with USB cables).

And very humbled by the experience it has taught us. Since then, we have continuously sought ways to make our service and our product better for our backers. Now, it�s time to deliver.In this 2nd generation update, reborn as PiCO Home, we�ve made the following improvements: Added Wi-Fi communication Enhanced accuracy of the temperature, relative humidity, and VOCs Added flash memory for storing air quality data without a network connection Interworks with Amazon�s Alexa Mobile application updates with better UI & UX A complete, new, and beautiful redesign of PiCO Home 1. MEMS Metal-oxide Gas Sensor: MEMS is the industry standard for detecting potentially harmful gases in the air. PiCO senses Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released by cleaning agents, paints, and carpets, flooring, and even your family! The MEMS sensor picks up any trace of Acetone, methanol, ethanol, and other harmful compounds in the air. High levels of VOCs in the air can have an impact on general comfort and well-being, as well as taking a toll on cognitive abilities. The MEMS Metal-oxide Gas sensing element is first class when it comes to real-world application. It has long-term stability and a low drift (meaning 1 will always be 1). It�s also protected against dust and water making it extremely robust and durable. 2. CMOSens� Sensor: When professionals need to measure temperature and humidity, they trust CMOSens�. So do we. 3. Laser Particle Sensor: PiCO's laser-based particle sensor is far more accurate than cheap, dull LED sensors, ensuring accurate measurement of fine dust (PM2.5 and PM10) in the air. These small particles are among the most dangerous and difficult forms of air pollution to protect yourself against. PM2.5 particles (just 0.0025mm in size) are so small they get through most masks and window seals right into your lungs and blood. 100% Delivery Guarantee and EU-Friendly Delivery There�s no secret about the challenges involved in delivering bits and atoms, but we know what we are doing. We give you our word and guarantee that every backer will receive a quality product made with skill, dedication and passion. We're so sure about PiCO Home that we are offering a 100% Delivery Guarantee. If we fail to deliver the rewards for whatever reason, we will reimburse the full amount you pledged on Kickstarter.

Glow takes place in a world where magic catalyzed both industrial revolution and nuclear holocaust. Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world. With the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world. Until one day the Towers fell. The story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain. Issue One introduced us to Caszy and Koken, siblings scavengers of the Wastes with extraordinary abilities. Issue Two continues the story as the witch Myra makes a compelling proposition. While Issue Three explores the ramifications of the misunderstanding between Caszy and Myra. Magic in Glow is channeled through the language of ancient Nymera, the former masters of the world. In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Colm Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger. Nymeran is used a number of ways in the comic, including sound effects. Each digital edition of Glow comes with a language guide that teaches you the secrets of ancient Nymeran. Ray Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow. Together, they�re the founders of the creative imprint known as Mythopoeia. Glow is their second comic book series after the the dieselpunk airship adventure Skies of Fire. Ray is based in Los Angeles and Vince in London.

This project is designed to help me stay busy. I have found making coin rings to be very therapeutic and would definately welcome a new project to help with absorbing my idle time. Using metal, force, and fire to transform a simple coin into beautiful jewelry is quite therapeutic. In October 2003 while deployed to Iraq I was injured in a HMMWV accident, leaving me with chronic pain for the past 13. Additionally, like many vets, I have been diagnosed with PTSD. It was during a counseling session where it was suggested that I find an outlet for stress and anxiety. From that suggestion came Southern Coinworks, where I have been using pressure, stress, and fire to complete unique pieces of jewelry. Once again, thank you for taking the time to look at my project and I hope to have your support.

Our mission is to normalize what women go through in all stages of motherhood by providing laughter and genuine love through our very own experiences. Each of us offers a unique point of view based on our different experiences in raising a girl versus boy and being a working mom versus stay at home mom. Although we face differences, we also share the want and need to support each other and other moms out there. We specialize in talking about the uncomfortable and are passionate about normalizing the weird, the ugly, and the hard. As soon as we are able, we will be recording episodes that are long enough for us to get real but also short enough to listen to during a commute to the grocery store. Once we acquire equipment, our goal is to begin recording 20-30 minute episodes, create an easily accessible website, and to actively communicate with our listeners via social networking. However, all of these aspects come with a price. The equipment we wish to purchase runs for just over 300 dollars and it will cost 600 dollars to launch a high-quality website with personalized graphic design and photography. It will also come at an expense to put our material on a podcast platform so that we are able to stream through Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Apple Podcast. With our ever evolving, not-so-glamorous motherhood, we know that we will never run out of content. We are confident that now is the time to launch this project. We are moms. We are millennials. (The kind of millennials that stay clear from discussing politics.)"

That's the goal of TerraOne apparel. Its a pretty big idea, and we're just starting out, but that's how we believe goals become a reality. By keeping our mission in mind at all times, we can ensure we are making products that are not only made from recycled material, but also feel just as good as any other shirt, begging the question; why doesn't everyone use recycled materials? Front Design So What? What Drove a College Student to Start This? The idea of TerraOne was born out of one concept; ""what if there was a company that was transparent, interactive, and sustainable; what a 21st century business could and should be?"" Transparent No one likes being lied to, that's why we don't and won't do it. We share all of our details and ""secrets"" on our sleeve, and plan to do so for the unforeseeable future. Just look at the section where we discuss materials. While saying we are 100% sustainable would sound great, we will openly admit that we are not at 100% recycled material yet due to the nature of our goal. Keeping only 13% cotton in our shirts saves us, and you, about $7, and since we are trying to keep prices as reflective of a non-sustainable brand as possible, we figured the 13% cotton is something we will take care of in the successive designs we come out with, and that for now the lower price will allow us to garner more attention. The bottom line is that being transparent is a win-win. The people who care about all the details can have them, the people that don't care about these details can choose to not read about them, and we can sleep soundly. Interactive We believe that a truly 21st century company should treat its customers in a fundamentally different way. We see a world where we have ongoing conversations with our customers, and act as a positive force in their lives. The first way we plan to do this is seen with the display of coordinates on our first design (see below), promoting our customers to get outside and enjoy nature. We have several plans for the future on how to expand this idea, and look forward to updating you! Sustainable This one is pretty straightforward; why use value chains when you can use value cycles? We plan on making our entire operation system 100% recycled as soon as possible. From electricity in offices to using electric powered trucks for transportation, it will be a challenge to accomplish this goal, but we are confident that the recycled material in our shirts is a great place to start. Why Apparel? Everyone and their mother, or at least everyone we know, sold t-shirts in college. A t-shirt company is one of the easiest to start in the world. Down the road we plan on expanding into other garments, but for now we're sticking to the bread and butter! Additionally, the amount of waste and resources that go into the apparel industry is unbelievable, especially when you find out how easy it is to make more sustainable apparel. It currently takes about 2,700 liters of water to grow the cotton necessary for one t-shirt. We don't know about you, but that's a little ridiculous to us. Even crazier, Americans use about 50 BILLION plastic water bottles per year. Once again, that's a little insane. There are more and more manufacturers of sustainable t-shirts every day, with people happy to print on them. The second we found this out, we knew that apparel was a great way to have a tangible impact. Why Kickstarter? As you can see in the rewards bar, we only have two reward levels; a general donation for any amount of $1 or above, and a t-shirt pre-order for $25. This is the case because the goal right now is to discover if this idea is something people are interested in, or if we need to tweak our approach a bit. Considering that TerraOne's team is a group of college students, Kickstarter is a relatively cheap and risk-free way to find out if we're onto something, or if we need to go back to the drawing board. With this in mind, if you do have the ability, and truly like the vision we are working towards, please consider pre-ordering a shirt! Tell Me About the Shirt Material The shirt has a surprisingly soft and cotton-like feel. It is made out of a tri-blend; 50% recycled plastic (polyester), 37% Modal (a sustainable material made from Beech Trees), and only 13% cotton. Design Based in Boulder, Colorado, we thought it would be a cool idea to make the limited time first design of our brand represent where we're from. The prominent back design (seen below) features a bright picture of the Flatirons, paying homage to our roots and serving as a reminder of the astounding nature of our planet. Below the image is the coordinates of the Flatirons, giving people an extra push to travel to this destination, and serving as the beginnings of our customer inclusion efforts. The front of the shirt features our logo in a clean, pocket tee design. Unfortunately there are no pocket tees currently produced by our manufacturer out of sustainable material, but we hope to incorporate this garment in the future. Back Design Why Do You Need My Money? The money from your pre-order serves two purposes. The first of these is to show your vote of confidence in our idea. By pre-ordering a shirt, you let us know we're headed in the right direction, and that we are actually making an impact. The second way your pledge is useful to us is that in short, it will help us grow tremendously. All the money from this Kickstarter campaign will go to two places; the purchase of resources to make the brand as professional as possible (such as marketing tools and web designers), and the purchase of shirts in advance, so that we may start selling from our website. These actions will allow us to transition into a more grounded business and give us the reputation to start taking next steps towards reaching the end goal of making a worldwide difference. When Will I Get My Shirt? Since we are only doing pre-orders right now, there will be a slight delay between the time you order and when you get your shirt. Once the campaign ends, or we fill up on pre-orders, we will go into production. Your shirt will be produced within three weeks, and be shipped to you, arriving at your door in about a week. Email updates will be sent both when we go into production, and when we ship your shirt out to you."

Hey there! Nice to meet you all. Our names are Jason Ballew, Nick Martin, and Price Garrison and we're the creators of Kingless Generation, the production company behind the development of the new work, Divine Spark, or Young Man Move Over Here: A Gnostic Odyssey through Time and Space. Or Divine Spark for short! Over 2 years ago, we were hanging out playing some board games when we started talking about the Gnostic Gospels. As we talked about them more and more, we couldn't shake the feeling that there was so much to discover within them. So we set out to do what felt like an impossible task, we read every single one. THAT'S RIGHT. We read 52 gospels. 52. GOSPELS. If you're unfamiliar with what the Gnostic Gospels are, they are a set of early 4th century Christian texts that were discovered in Egypt in 1945. What the texts contain is a completely different idea of what the Christian faith was meant to be. After attempts by the Church to discredit the Gnostics as heretical, the texts were eventually buried and lost to history. The long and short of their message? The God portrayed in the Bible as we know it is actually the physical manifestation of fear and ignorance. Yeah, read that again. If that sounds CRAZY and also SO INTERESTING, first, you're totally right. And second, follow us on Instagram @kinglessgeneration to hear more every day. Photo: Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont, CA. It IS pretty cool, but like, what exactly are you doing? What a great question! This Kickstarter is raising funds for a series of workshops that will allow us to hire a group of actors, designers, writers, movers and amazing artists of all types to help us untangle this crazy web of really amazing material. After reading all of the gospels, we've distilled everything we've read into three different categories that we want to explore: 1. Origin Stories 2. Wisdom vs Ignorance 3. Religion + Theology Each thematic workshop will consist of two weekends where the artists will gather and begin to help us to get a better sense of what will thematically resonate in our piece, how we can activate and engage with the text through movement and voice, and most importantly, to bring some diverse new voices into the room. This is just the beginning too! After these workshops, we plan to take everything we've learned and turn this into a full production. And it's going to be amazing! But we cannot start this process without each of you! What is all of my money going towards? Totally fair question and it just so happens that WE MADE A CHART FOR YOU! So let's break this down shall we? The largest cost we have is for Rehearsal Space. We want to make sure we have rehearsal space to do this in. Otherwise we'd be out on the street and I'm telling you that it would be VERY WEIRD to do this on the streets of New York y'all. Following that we have Kickstarter Perks. We want to make you some sweet swag and this is just what it costs to do that! We have our vendors all selected and it's going to be great. Next is Artist Stipends. We want to pay everyone for every workshop and we want to make sure that we treat them well! This lets us do that. Lastly, we have Workshop Materials. We want to make sure that we have all the goods at the workshop such as costume pieces, props, paper to write on, water for everyone to drink, you name it. We've also included Kickstarter related costs. This includes the 5% figure that they take. WOW HOW EXCITING... what about them rewards though? Yes, you're totally right. This is Kickstarter after all. WE HAVE SOME FUN REWARDS FOR YOU! Want a good look at the designs we're turning into pins? YES OKAY! These amazing designs are going to be transformed into beautiful enamel pins. They will look a bit different when they're produced, but we'll keep you updated with designs as they're developed! We can't wait to see how these will look. We have a vendor all selected and once we get the funds, we'll start the process! Pin Design by Katharine Wynkoop Such a cool design and it will OBVIOUSLY make a great pin. What about our logo design pin? ALSO VERY COOL. Logo Design by Katharine Wynkoop We've also developed an amazing poster design that we cannot wait to send to print. Look at this! Poster Design by Katharine Wynkoop If those designs aren't enticing enough and you just want more, then we have a tier for you. We will write you a personal parable AND you get everything else. If you want to really support this project in all the ways possible, you can even get a Workshop Producer credit. These are just some fun perks, but remember all the money you give is going to the development and support of some amazing artists! If you have any questions about any of the reward tiers, please feel free to reach out! One last thing: Who are you and What is Kingless Generation? Great point. Kingless Generation is a new production company based out of New York dedicated to story-telling that sparks curiosity, compassion, and creativity. We believe that through myth-making we discover truth, through world building we understand our reality, through creating characters we identify with humanity, and through gathering audiences we build communities. Kingless Generation is dedicated to creating art that provokes questions rather than provides answers. Jason Ballew in The Cherry Orchard That's just a fancy way of saying, we're artists. We've all been involved in theater and film for quite some time and are combining our efforts under the guiding principals above. Divine Spark is Kingless Generation's first production as a company and we're so excited to start the development process. Hatchlings, a reading series produced by Nick Martin Again, what we're hoping to do is raise money to allow us to do a series of workshops. After these workshops, we'll take what we've learned and start devising a show! Theater is one of those things that needs a lot of time to develop and see what works and what doesn't and in order to do that, we need a much larger group of artists than the three of us. Also a more diverse group of artists than just us. Having more voices in the room allows for more questions and in the end a better piece. And that's what we're hoping to do, with your help. Price Garrison in Loserville So what's next? Well, first off thank you for deciding to join us on this odyssey! We cannot do any of this without you. After this Kickstarter when we're fully funded, we're planning on spending the month of June working out all the details. Finding the right rehearsal spaces, reaching out and building our team and putting all of the pieces into place to make this all happen. We're planning on having our first workshop up and running by late summer or early fall (depending on our team and space's availability). We'll be keeping everyone up to date here as well as on our social channels as things develop, but you'll all be along for the ride! Follow along with us over the next 30 days to learn more about what we're doing, get some insight into the workshops we're hoping to run and get to learn more about who Kingless Generation is and what we're all about!

I will travel Route 66 as much as possible... this means a bit of off-roading, hiking to great scenic spots and camping beneath the stars in most areas. I have researched, for years, for my time with this iconic road and it is time to experience it! That said, my approach to this trip is about the experience and not about time. I've planned and budgeted for a three-week trip but don't be surprised if I stay out even longer. When I get this kind of itch, I scratch to fulfillment... In addition to taking along my digital and film cameras, I'm also bringing along my drone and my vlogging equipment. There will be frequent uploads to my YouTube channel detailing my progress for you to support and follow :) Why support me when it's been done so many times? Because Route 66 is rapidly changing, no person's trip is the same as another. Travelers of the route approach it with their own perspectives and express their own takeaways from it. All have their own unique approach, style, and level of photography. Me, I'm very good at photography and often push myself through my boundaries... being comfortable with just an 'okay' photograph is just not my style. Only the best of my best can be expected to be featured in my book. Books will be shipped out the second week of September. Every backer's name, state, and country will be acknowledged and every book will be signed by me. This will be a limited run. I'm only going to print 150 books for this project... and each will be numbered. Prints of images will be available for purchase on my website after books ship."

Plaato Keg is internet-connected, so you will get the notification wherever you are. All existing pledges will get Leak-Detection included if we hit $150.000. How it Works The electrical current between two non-corrosive metal probes are measured continously, and if a leak occurs, the current increases, and the device knows a leak is in action. Once you start kegging, there�s no way back. We know the drill. Starting out happy with a single keg, then suddenly finding yourself with seven kegs. That is why we designed Plaato Keg to be easy to install. 1. Transfer beer 2. Connect device 3. Ready to tap PLAATO Keg uses three synchronized, high-quality load-cells that measures the keg-weight every 0.1 second, sending real-time data of your kegs directly to your smartphone using WiFi. Product Anatomy Made of a impact resistant polycarbonate body, the device is made to withstand even the roughest environments, and at the same time keeping the measurements right on spot. Technology Comparisons There are two leading technologies used to monitor beer kegs; Load Cells and Flow-meters. As beer brewers, we found this to be an easy choice. Don�t get fooled by the sleek design. The PLAATO Keg is small, but it�s ready for big kegs full of beer. High performance materials combined with thought through solutions makes it durable, waterproof and ready to handle kegs up to 13 US gallons / 50L. Fits 99% of all kegs Waterproofed 100% NON-Invasive - No cleaning - No maintenance Easy setup Batch-specific details, real-time measurements and kegerator dashboard. The free PLAATO-app lets you have all your kegs in the same place. Each keg has its own dashboard, letting you type in batch-specific data, including: Last Pour Size Batch name Kegging date OG & FG The built-in calculator automatically calculates the ABV% Real-Time Tap Status The app automatically calculates the volume of beer in the keg based on the Final Gravity, and you can choose between Metric or US Customary units. Connect all your kegs Add unlimited number of kegs in the same account. Industry-standard accuracy High-quality, full-bridge load-cells makes the PLAATO Keg highly accurate, even on the smallest pours (and on the bigger ones). Check out the feedback from our beta-users. Technical specifications, Materials & Performance PLAATO� KEG is developed with feedback from over 350 ambassadors enrolled in the PLAATO Test User Program. This ensures a device that fits 99% of the most used kegs out there, including: All types of Corny Kegs Key-Kegs Torpedo Kegs Sankey Kegs It came to us while in development. If we can measure the real-time level of beer, then we can do the same thing with CO2! Presenting you the CO2-version of the PLAATO Keg. Enable CO2-mode in the Plaato-app, and turn one of your keg-devices into your CO2-bottle monitor, checking the remaining level of gas in real-time. Use it to have control over the remaining level of CO2 to make sure you have enough for the upcoming brew-day, or use it to detect a CO2-leak from a connector. CO2-bottles loses mass as the CO2 is used by carbonation, tapping or leaks. This means that by placing the CO2- bottle on top of our ""PLAATO Keg"", you will get precise estimates of the remaining level of CO2. This feature can also be used to detect leaks. Most CO2-bottles fit directly onto the Plaato Keg, providing you the tool to never be unawarely out of CO2 again EARLY BIRD REWARDS UNLIMITED REWARDS Comparing the vitals of the PLAATO Keg with the other solutions out there, and it'll make a clear picture We believe in an open community where hardware and software are unified.

The movie I have written hear is wildly based on a real life story with me and my two dogs. I took on a dog as a puppy, I named this puppy Thunder, I had him for about two weeks and then decided to take on his brother from the same litter (who I named Lightning) so that Thunder wouldn't feel lonely when I went to work, after trying to take care of both of them for about two months I realized I simply couldn't do it so I sold Lightning to a young couple who loves him so much and is giving him the best possible life. Me and Thunder still visit Lightning every other week and plan to keep doing so. Through this experience I wanted to do what I do best and write about it, even though Lightning is no longer my dog him and Thunder have still made a great impact on my life and I would love to use that to create an amazing animated movie that I named ""Thunder And Lightning, A Dog Story"" With your help I can create this movie for all to enjoy as I have enjoyed them."

While this game is destined for world-wide retail, we know there's so much more we can offer by starting on Kickstarter: Firstly, we're better able to gauge market demand for a game of this type. We're able to add much more content into both the Retail version and a Kickstarter exclusive Deluxe version (Deluxe version will also be sold at some conventions). We can offer you amazing upgraded components, such as a box with full printing on the inside (considering the box is part of the game; pending stretch goal unlock), special heat-printed monster cubes, and adorable custom heat-printed meeples!

What If... Imagine a place where you could let your creativity run wild, a place where you could serve your clients and practice your art. This is a place where you could feel like yourself all the time and not just some of the time, and in doing your work, you could achieve the feeling that comes only when you have the space and the flexibility that you need to feel most comfortable. That space, it is sad to say, is something that most professionals within the salon industry never get to experience. The State of the Salon Industry Take a look around at the salon industry in your local area. Unless you have traveled in a time machine to some decades past, you will notice that the industry is in decline. Everywhere you go, salons are closing down, not opening, failing out of business, not driving profits. If you measure the financial success at these salons against the professionals' passion and strength, it doesn't make any sense. That is the thing, though: it is not the passion that is lacking. Passion Everywhere You Go Nope, wherever you look, you will find salon industry professionals who are ready and eager to do whatever they need to do to serve their clients well. It is inspiring to talk to these people, to hear how deeply they care about their jobs and how much of themselves they pour into all the work that they do. Every morning they wake up motivated to let their creative energy flow and to follow through on the commitments that they have made to their respective art forms. As stated previously, the problem with the salon industry is certainly not a lack of passion. It's the business model. If there were half as much sense in the salon industry's business model as there is passion in salon industry professionals, we would not be in this situation. Salons are burning money, creating a situation that is untenable for everyone who works in it and relies on it. Introducing: SaloNet SaloNet is the solution to the problem that the salon industry is facing. We have devised a new, cutting-edge, intelligent business model upon which to build a stronger, more resilient salon industry. It all starts with just two locations, but we are confident that SaloNet will rapidly blossom into a franchising opportunity. For hairstylists, makeup artists, lash technicians, massage therapists, and estheticians in the Bay Area (and beyond) eager to change up the industry for the better, SaloNet is the way to do. It's not overly complicated either. How It Works Becoming a member through one of our packages, artists can meet clients and then book work spaces at SaloNet, leasing out the spaces on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis. Each membership will come with a virtual address, access to our online portal, private space, and reception room usage surrounding the appointment block. That's all there is to it. Cutting down on overhead and putting power back into entrepreneurial salon pros' hands, SaloNet is going to effect a wide-reaching revolution within the industry. This is a business that is more than a business: it is a proof of concept that will show people just what we need to do in order to rescue the salon industry from the depths it has fallen to. In the future, we will also encourage other salons to partner with us, helping to generate referrals and fill up otherwise-empty space. What We Need & What You Get Right now, we are turning to you, Kickstarter, for help raising the funds that we need to bring develop a companion app and software backend for SaloNet. Our goal through this campaign is to raise $70,574, which will cover the costs of turning our expansion idea into something that is viable to scale, attracting the right professionals and facilitating their transition to our business model. To show our appreciation for everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering some exciting rewards, including limited-edition merchandise branded with the SaloNet logo and consultations with the SaloNet founder. The Importance of Wellness In addition to serving salon professionals by putting them in control of their artistic careers, we will also be serving those professionals' clients by making the salon environment more conducive to top-quality work. This is a situation where everyone wins. If you have ever had a negative salon experience, SaloNet is something that you should be dreaming about. This is a once-in-a-lifetime idea that will turn the salon industry upside down. Other Ways You Can Help In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can also show your support for SaloNet by letting all your friends and family know what we are doing. Spread the word on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use! We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for taking the time to read about our plans for the future."

However, the scientists in the lab can only experiment on so many baddies per day. This means that only the first four baddies killed in each battle will enter the lab. This, of course, turns the typical strategy of targeting the strongest baddies first on its head. Sure, you can bust down that Bone Dragon in round one, but that means you�re going to be bringing a pretty nasty baddie onto the lab mat. As baddies are eliminated, they�re placed into the lab mat�s chambers for testing in the order they�re defeated. The first baddie defeated goes in chamber one, the second in chamber two, etc. As you move into the recovery phase, the splicing will begin, and you�ll make adjustments to your tyrant mat accordingly. Splicing health? You�ll take the combined health of the two baddies adjacent to the lab die. If the total is more than the current total health of your tyrant, increase your tyrant�s health by one. You�ll follow similar instructions for all other stats and attributes. Splice too many ranged baddies? Congrats! You�ve unlocked the powerful ranged ability for your tyrant! Of course, where this really gets interesting is in the combination of skills you�ll run into. Your final tyrant could have as many as SIX skills in play. Each time skills are spliced, place the baddie chip the skills are being taken from into your tyrant mat. Have two baddies with Poison 2? Add them together and...congratulations! You�ve created the first ever tyrant with Poison 4! Poison 4, of course, would break the bounds of modern Gearloc science, so you may find yourself using a D6 to track this skill should such a revolutionary breakthrough occur. You�ll be able to create any number of awful combinations. In fact, the more baddies you own, the more headaches you�ll be able to give yourself! And don�t even think about giving your tyrant the Flee skill from a Timid Geophage or Krelln Skittish - if your tyrant escapes in round 3, you will not achieve victory! Watching your tyrant develop over the course of your adventure brings new strategy to TMB beyond just the order you take out baddies. A sudden introduction of a bevy of health or a particularly unpleasant skill combo can require unconventional builds in your Gearlocs. Every game and tyrant is unique, so you�ll need to stay on your toes! GEARLOC INTERNSHIP PROGRAM MODE: TYRANT CREATION OUTSIDE OF A STANDARD GAME Don�t want to bother with additional effort during battle or recovery and just want to create something to fight? Welcome to your new internship at the Gearloc Council Laboratories! Simply grab your lab mat, tyrant mat, Nobulous deck, and as many baddies as you care to mix, and prepare to get splicing! Just like the standard game, you�ll calculate the baddie points for the day based on the number of players who will face off against your tyrant. Draw a Nobulous card for your daily dose of condescension and the twist you�ll be dealing with as you work. Draw the appropriate amount of baddie points and get to work. It�s simple and quick yet full of meaningful decisions. If you�re a TMB novice and find yourself getting stomped by Nom or Mulmesh repeatedly, try your hand at creating something light and more beatable for your group or solo play. Think you�ve �solved� Too Many Bones and are looking for something to truly test the mettle of your four-player group? Take a stab at making something with Break, Hardy and Poison 3, that targets the two weakest Gearlocs. The possibilities are endless, and we can�t wait to see what folks are able to create within this system. We�re even including a quick boss play score mode similar to the rules for a certain hidden riddle reward from Undertow, allowing you to post your toughest creations online and challenge others to defeat them using the fewest Training Points possible. Given how active the TMB community is, we expect this to be a big hit! Both modes of tyrant creation serve to further extend the already extensive challenge options in the TMB universe and will offer you literally endless content to play. We can�t wait for your 1st day in the lab. You�ll be replacing some Gearlocs who have found themselves unemployed for one reason or another. Read more about them in the add-on section below!"

I'm Andrew, but you can call me ""Schmandrew"" because, let's face it, there are a lot of Andrews out there who also make art. I'm an Illustrator, Designer, and Professor who smiles a lot. Over the last three years, I've slowly transitioned from the world of pop art style alternate movie posters to the world of freelance and original art. Before we get too deep and become besties, let me explain exactly what this Kickstarter is and why it�s important. First and foremost, this is a campaign to create enamel pins alongside my good friend, and fellow artist, Allen Panakal. Allen and I have overlapping audiences and we�ve both been toying around with the idea of doing pin Kickstarters for awhile now. The thing that makes this truly unique though is that we are running separate campaigns, BUT we are going to reward anyone who supports us both with a very limited edition metal card with both of our art on it! On top of that, we have a stretch goal planned where we�ll each do an interpretation of the other person�s illustration! Pretty rad, right?! Allen and I at C2E2 So now that I�ve hyped you up, it�s time to get real. In order to understand where these designs came from I need to explain just what the �Banishment� Collection is and what it means. Banishment Everything changed when the fire nation attacked� Sorry, I couldn�t resist! It�s hard not to jump to Avatar when you start a sentence with �Everything changed.� In all seriousness though, I went through a really difficult experience at the end of 2017 and into the early parts of 2018. Without going too in depth, a few very important cornerstones in my life either left or passed away. It was hard. I�m usually a pretty happy, optimistic person, but during all of that, I was not myself. Finally in May of 2018, I remember thinking things were starting to return to normal, but I still felt like I had some pent up energy that needed a release. That�s when I started on �Banishment� and everything actually changed. �Banishment� is about that turning point in any struggle where things start to improve. It�s that moment of victory where the tides turn and good overcomes evil. It�s the first of many steps out of any struggle we may have gone through or are currently in. It wasn't the whole story which eventually led to two more pieces, �The Banisher� and �The Banished�. The Banisher & The Banished While �The Banisher� represents the mix of exhaustion and relief as we let go and move on, �The Banished� symbolizes the beauty we can find wherever we end up. We are all stronger than we think and whatever happens, we will get through it. That is what the �Banishment� Collection represents. Having no prior experience doing personal work, I had no idea how it would be received. Thankfully, I was blown away by the reactions I got! So many people shared their own stories with me and how they related to ""Banishment"". Someone even got one of my pin designs tattooed! It�s because of that strong reaction that I decided to create these soft enamel pins designs. I think we could all use a physical reminder on our person to remind ourselves just how strong we really are. Check out Allen's pins, prints, mats, and metal HERE And if you only want to snag the pins, there's no need to jump between campaigns to get the metal cards. Just pick Tier 2.5 and you'll get our pins and all the crossover benefits! Assuming we can exceed our funding goal, I've prepared some stretch goals to unlock. Last but least, all shipping costs will be added on at checkout. All shipping amounts are priced at cost via the weight of each item."

We know folks don't often use CDs anymore, but many of our listeners (and our bandmates!) have lived in alternative situations, without wifi and Spotify and we really want everyone to have access to this music (and have a beautiful package to open!) so you can all carry this music with you everywhere you go! WHO IS MOTHER MARROW? Currently, Mother Marrow is: Charity Cimarron on vocals, guitar, banjo, Devin Crow on banjo, Emmalee Hunnicutt on cello, and Matt Shepard on drums. Mother Marrow was born out of Charity Cimarron's solo songwriting project, Rusalka. With many musicians in and out of the picture over the years, there was never a cohesive band until now. We have been really enjoying playing together, and the music is feeling really vibrant and alive. As our drummer, Matt Shepard, said the other day, ""I just want to be in service to the music."" That's why we're doing this! This music is medicine for tender, feeling humans (or those who want to find their tenderness), who are looking for threads of deep truth, in this chaotic, confusing time that we live in. It is healing us, and we want to share that with the world. Mother Marrow on the web: www.mothermarrowmusic.com Facebook: MotherMarrow IG: @mothermarrow Devin and Charity playing as part of Traveling Appalachian Revue '18 WHAT DOES MOTHER MARROW SOUND LIKE? The songs are all written by Charity Cimarron and come from a deep connection to the spiritual realms, a living relationship with the natural world, and a desire to understand the human struggle. Following stories of pain and heartbreak, and awe of the depths that exist in simple things, the lyrics of these songs have ""teeth and tenderness"". Sharp things made soft again by expression and love. Our sound could be described as Elemental Folk, but that's not a recognized genre (yet ;). The guitar style is complex fingerpicking, with a lyrical flow, and the cello adds sweeping fills, and dives right into the depths. The drums add an intensity and drive in all the right places, while the banjo brightens the sound, or haunts your soul, depending on the mood. The strident vocals, will cut straight to your heart, and bring tears to your eyes, or heal forgotten wounds. (Listen to some older recordings of Charity's solo work here: Rusalka-EP 2015) Kickstarter Kickoff Show at The Mothlight, May 18th, 2019 WHAT NEXT? Mother Marrow will be touring the new album August 9-20, and we are still looking to book shows. Want us to play in your town? If you live in the South-East, Mid-West, or East Coast, hit us up! We especially love house shows! There are already new songs that are being born and dreaming of the next album. Knock us out with this Kickstarter, and you won't have to wait long for the next one! Thank you for believing in this music, and joining with us in making this dream come true! We couldn't do it without you. We hope this album will be a gift to the world, in gratitude for the power of music, community, and all the gift of life that we are receiving every day. With anticipation, Mother Marrow Recording secret tracks for our donors ears only!"

Her lyrics were so clever that Tony Award-winning lyricist, Lynn Ahrens (Once On This Island, Ragtime) exclaimed, �That lyric is gold! I wish I had written that myself!� I knew instantly that Kit (also a composer and book-writer) was someone with whom I needed to work. In 2017, I founded �IndieWorks Theatre Company� and immediately started searching for something to produce or direct that was fun and challenging; a story that had real heart and that I could pour my heart into. Kit sent me the script and score for a show she had been writing for nearly ten years. I giggled gleefully as this stirring, touching, and sometimes just-plain-silly story unfolded page by page, reminding me what it�s like to see the world through the excited eyes of a child. I called her up and with a huge smile, I said, �I want in on The Giant Hoax!� In the months that followed, we worked together to fine-tune the story and streamline the cast in my Midtown office (also known as the Starbucks on 39th & 8th) and in November 2017, we presented two staged readings in Brooklyn to incredible response from both audiences and industry professionals. In the year and a half since, we�ve put together a version of the show that is ready for the New York stage! The Giant Hoax is one of Kit�s most heartfelt and endearing musicals, full of colorful characters, unexpected plot twists, history, adventure, and most of all, imagination. I am thrilled and honored to present it as IndieWorks Theatre Company�s very first mainstage production! There are wonderful things in the world out there, and I truly believe, as you will, that The Giant Hoax is one of them! In 1869, on a small farm in Cardiff, New York, Mr. William �Stub� Newell digs up a giant stone figure and instantly controversy arises! Is it an ancient statue? A modern hoax? Or � as Newell claims � an authentic, prehistoric, petrified giant? Emily, a bright young girl � with quite the active imagination � has decided for herself that the Giant is real and runs away from home to prove it. Newell, charmed by the girl�s steadfast belief that there are truly wonderful things in the world, offers her a job as an apprentice barker in exchange for room, board, and unfettered access to the Giant who later that evening seems to come to life right before her eyes! They become instant �imaginary friends,� going on amazing adventures to the farthest reaches of Emily�s imagination. But all is not well. When unscrupulous circus impresario, P.T. Barnum, offers a hefty sum to buy Newell�s profitable, prehistoric attraction � and soon after rejected � he comes up with a scheme to steal Newell�s business right from under his nose! An enraged Newell brings a lawsuit against Barnum, but his case begins to fall apart when the judge asks him to prove his giant�s authenticity. With Newell�s back against a wall and her new friend�s existence called into question, Emily must sort through what is fact, what is fiction, and what�s all just a part of her imagination. Bringing an imaginative new musical to life is no simple task! It takes time and it costs a lot of money. Especially when you're bringing it to the New York stage! Now, this isn't Broadway (yet...) where capitalization amounts can reach tens of millions of dollars, but there are lots of amazing people to pay, things to buy, and equipment to rent, and for The Giant Hoax, that's no small feat! Here's how it all breaks down: We realize, of course, that we have a lot of money to raise in a very short amount of time. I mean, $60,000...?! That's a lot of zeroes! But we here at IndieWorks Theatre Company believe in this show and haven't been shy about putting our own skin in the game. We've scrimped and saved and put every bit of our own spare money into getting this production started, giving us a nice $12,000 head start on raising the $60,000 needed to fully produce The Giant Hoax at Theatre Row. On top of that, we have a pledge from an angel donor to match our Kickstarter campaign funds up to $10,000! So we are on our way to success! We realize that theatre is a risky endeavor. But we have a contract with the theatre and so the show must go on! And with your help, it will! In addition to the Kickstarter, we've got other plans in place to help us raise the money: We're producing a Summer Cabaret Series of five different shows from showcases of composers and lyricists to dirty little ditties, to a celebration of pride and more! We're partnering with local companies to create exciting fundraising social events that will take our participants all around the city! We're courting corporate sponsors in hopes to build future working relationships! We're doing pledge drives and so much more! All five shows in IndieWorks' Summer Cabaret Series. Got any other ideas? Throw them our way! ""So who are you, anyway?"" We're glad you asked! We've started to assemble an incredible team for our inaugural mainstage production, but we still need a few more people. You can help us hire a music director, costume, set, & puppet designers, orchestrator, stage managers, and more! The Giant Hoax Creative Team (...so far!) ""What have you done with this show so far?"" We've done quite a lot, actually! Kit has been writing the show for 10 years and in that time the following happened: In 2009, The Giant Hoax was first presented as a staged reading at the Classic Theater Guild's 6th Annual New Play Festival at Proctors Theater's Education Center. Then some rewrites. The Giant Hoax was presented by the Classic Theater Guild to sold-out audiences at Proctors Theater in Schenectady, NY in November 2010. Directed by Criss Macaione-Bilodeau, with musical direction by Rebecca Benjamin. Then more rewrites. In Summer 2017 The Giant Hoax was presented in a developmental reading at The Playground Experiment in New York, NY, as part of their First Reads series. Then a couple more rewrites. In the summer of 2017, IndieWorks Theatre Company took interest in the show and... You guessed it... rewrites! In Fall 2017 The Giant Hoax was selected as part of the The Gallery Player's Overtures series in Brooklyn, NY. Directed by Christopher Michaels with musical direction by Nissa Kahle. (Do we even have to say it?) In the two years that followed, Kit and Christopher have worked the show into a version that is ready for the New York stage. This is the version we look forward to presenting to you this fall! Images from the 2010 Classic Guild production, the 2017 Playground Experiment reading, and the 2017 IndieWorks staged reading production at The Gallery Players in Brooklyn, NY. To gear up for our fall production of The Giant Hoax, we've also done a lot! So please consider making a contribution to our campaign and help us bring Kit Goldstein Grant's imaginative new musical to Theatre Row on 42nd Street! You won't be sorry you did!

The sophomore effort by your best friends and favorite husband/wife indie-folk duo. Joymonger is a collection of songs inspired by a return to innocence. It's an album that was born in the spirit of 70's records by Simon and Garfunkel and grew up alongside modern records of indie-folk. Every song is produced by us and mixed by JD Tiner (Producer of our last EP - Post Modern!). For the first time ever, we've created these songs almost entirely by ourselves. And now we want to invite our community to help us make Joymonger our most personal album yet. All backers will receive a digital download of My Baby, Jimmy, and Me at the completion of the kickstarter. Creating joy out of nothing was a theme for this album. Every song started the way it did when we were kids - with laughing, jumping, and cheering. Joymonger is a return to innocence and a genuine love of making joyful music. Last year, we spent most of our energy releasing singles. It was an exciting year! But when we started preparing for our next project, we felt deeply that these songs were meant to live together as a collective album. The concept and song choice are meant to be experienced together. Working in the studio on Joymonger. Honestly: Making records is really hard. There are a ton of long nights in the studio beating our heads against the wall, insecurities as we build out every song, and the expenses are crippling. Kickstarter makes it possible for us to make the record we want to make the way we want to make it. We're recording the album ourselves and every dollar spent goes to take this record further than we've ever been. Where is your money going? Every dollar over our initial goal will go towards marketing and promoting our album! We reached our first goal! The Joymonger Kickstarter Exclusive T Joymonger Kickstarter Exclusive Ebbets Hat Joymonger is a 9 song album of brand new music from us. If you've been at a show in the last year, you probably heard some of the songs performed. It was important to us to make sure we loved playing every one of these songs live.

We're planning to release the first single from the album this summer (July).

The comic is completely finished: all 22 pages of story and art plus the covers are done! All we need now is YOU! The Story In 1967, Scott Anders rocketed into space on a secret, CIA-sponsored mission referred to as the Kayless Project... to investigate an astronomical anomaly known only in the darkest corridors of the U.S. Government. Three days later all communication ceased. The project, seen as an embarrassing and costly failure, was erased from history and forgotten. Until today, when Scott mysteriously plummets to earth and emerges, unscathed, and hellbent on one purpose� to return to the anomaly in space. Why does he want to go back? How did he gain his new invulnerability? And what is the mysterious organization that stands in his way, determined to protect the secret of Kayless at all costs?

I�ve created a second stretch goal of $5,000, which would further support the overall art & design, animation, and storyboard production of ""All Together Now!"". It would also help create more animated content to share, further developing important characters, their stories, and the world they live in. Thank you so much for your incredible support, and for helping to create inclusive queer media for kids! All Together Now! is a queer animated kid's show. It's about a community of people with different gender identities, body types, abilities, family structures, and cultural backgrounds. They are facing life�s challenges together by sharing their stories with each other, and building a world that celebrates inclusivity, accessibility, and kindness. I'm Molly Allis. I'm an artist, educator, filmmaker and musician living in Los Angeles. As a queer, gender non-conforming person, I realize that being a kid could have been easier if I�d been able to watch a children�s show that was entertaining, educational, and had characters living outside of a gender binary. This could�ve helped me a lot as I tried to figure out who I was. My goal with All Together Now! is to cultivate hope and joy through greater representation in children�s media, so all kids feel proud of who they are, instead of ashamed or scared about what makes them different. I will build upon community-oriented shows like Sesame Street, and artistic shows like Pee Wee�s Playhouse. Frankie's bedroom The world of All Together Now! is a culmination of many things from my own life: teaching kids how to use tools and build projects out of recycled materials, making puppet shows, playing the drums in an activist marching band, and being a queer person living in community. I am passionate about engaging young people's creative voices and visions, so they feel empowered to step up as change-makers, transforming themselves and the world around them. Although I envision All Together Now first and foremost as a show for kids, it will ultimately be an all-ages show that children and adults can both enjoy for its storytelling, aesthetic and messages, bringing people of all ages and backgrounds together. The characters on All Together Now! learn important things like: how to listen to each other express feelings in healthy ways practice self-love. how to make fun projects Whether it�s at the collective bookstore, the community garden, the bike shop, or the marching band practice space, the characters on All Together Now! gain a lot from each other�s experiences. They share skills and resources to create inspiring performances, songs, parades, and gatherings that uplift their community. Sometimes, challenging conversations come up between characters who love and respect each other. How do different generations of people relate to gender, and how do they learn from each other�s experiences? Additionally, how do characters deal with being bullied because of how they dress, or what their families look like? Learning how to make stuff is empowering and fun! A large part of All Together Now! is centered around sharing skills and resources to make cool projects, mostly out of recycled materials. Characters teach each other how to sew costumes, write songs, build toys, cook yummy food, and perform shows in their neighborhood. Through making, they come together, share stories, and discover the power of their imaginations. In a time when many vulnerable communities are under attack, we need safe spaces that help foster connection through our differences. All Together Now! presents a world filled with diverse characters and situations that provide young viewers and their families opportunities to explore different ways of being, thinking, and feeling. I believe that we can create the world we want to live in, and learning how to live in community with each other is a crucial step to getting there. Glitter N' Letters Collective Bookstore In the world I've created for All Together Now!, I have a season�s worth of story ideas to share where characters take small but powerful steps towards social change. With your help, I can introduce people to the characters on the show, by creating 12 short animated vignettes that I can share online in the coming year. I plan on releasing these beginning in October 2019. My ultimate goal is to find a supportive home for this project to grow and develop into a TV series to reach larger audiences of kids and their families, expanding the reach of inclusive queer media. Your donation goes towards: Art production & design Animation Story & Character Development Storyboarding Kickstarter fees (10%) Rewards (6%) Miscellaneous production necessities My stretch goal is $20,000, which means that if my target amount of $15,000 is exceeded, the extra $5,000 will help me achieve a higher quality production value, as well as more in-depth story and character development, which would be hugely helpful! Marching band practice space As a child of the 90s, my artistic style has always been, and always will be, a nostalgic homage to the bright, colorful palettes that I grew up with. All Together Now! will be made with hand-drawn animation, using the textures of watercolor, colored pencil, markers and crayons for a handmade, personal feel. The show's aesthetic will help capture the exciting spirit and joy of creating things, inviting viewers of all ages to take out their markers and spontaneously draw inventive worlds in their notebooks like I did when I was a kid (and still do!)

We have some wonderful, new Christmas and worship music we would like to send out into the world�and we would love your help! Background Last year, I was at a place where I realized I�m a no talent, hack musician who had been writing worship songs for a while�some of which were pretty good�but I had no way of getting them out into the world. As I like to say, I have a face for radio and a voice for the shower. Anyway, I came up with this crazy idea�what if I collaborate with my artist friends who are great and help make these songs come to life. The result was Folk Hymnal�a collection of artists who create theologically rich songs in an accessible and attractive way. I worked with four different artists on four different songs and we released a Christmas EP called Incarnation Songs. And, I think it went great! I mean, my wife liked the songs, my kids, my mom�pretty much anyone related to me liked the songs. Seriously though, the whole process exceeded my expectations. The songs turned out great and they were received really well. My highest aim with this music is to create songs that could be sung by the local church and I received reports from churches around the country that they were singing these songs. Future Projects My role as co-writer and producer of Folk Hymnal has gone so well that I want to keep it going. I have some more original, Jesus-y, folky, non-traditional Christmas songs that I would like to release into the world that would come together into an EP called Incarnation Songs Volume 2. Additionally, I have a whole other EP of songs I�d like to release in 2020 that I�m tentatively entitling Good News Songs. So, I�m terrified�and excited. Would you join me on this terrifying, exciting journey? The Artists Once again, I'm aided by some amazing friends and artists.

In regards to her 2013 album Ready This Time, Andrew Greenhalgh of Stereo Subversion writes ""...the album captures the diversity of Lantz alongside her intelligent and upbeat songwriting style. Lantz�s sound culls from influences as rich as Patty Griffin, Bonnie Raitt, and Eva Cassidy as well as more modern tones akin to Zooey Deschanel and Brandi Carlile, wrapping her lyrics in a warm blanket of eclectic soundscapes.""

A Tribute to the Creative Forces of Trout Grass The film's production lasted nearly three years and spanned two countries, including locations in China, Seattle, Montana, Wyoming, Florida, and Arizona. Andy Royer and Ed George were there, guiding the operations, every dynamic step of the way. Recently, these two energetic creators of Trout Grass passed on to the spirit world. Producer, co-writer, and bamboo extraordinaire Andy parted from two daughters and a wife when he died in 2015 after a years-long battle with cancer. Director and cinematographer Ed left unexpectedly in 2016 following a heart attack. Ed�s first gig in filmmaking was as an assistant on the legendary Woodstock documentary, shot 50 years ago this summer! Trout Grass is an important part of Ed and Andy's dynamic body of work, and it must continue to be available and discoverable for audiences. Trout Grass: The Revival Edition is a tribute to the two innovators. Cinematographer Ed George enjoying a day's work in Montana. Photo from ThisIsBozeman.com ""A Beautifully Crafted Film."" Trout Grass: The Revival Edition. A legendary rod maker treks to the source of his inspiration. A craftsman halfway around the planet encounters ""spirits of the bamboo world."" A writer-angler contemplates the power of our connection to rivers. And diverse audiences discover what it takes to convert a piece of grass into a six-sided baton ready to conduct an orchestra of trout and water. The documentary Trout Grass unveils the joys of international camaraderie, fine craftsmanship, and majestic rivers as it tracks the 10,000-mile passage of bamboo around the world. From a lush forest in remote China, to a rustic workshop in Montana, this film traces the transition of bamboo from a living plant to a finished fly rod. Trout Grass has always been an international journey into the passion of fly fishing, but it is also a captivating window into the life force of rivers and the intricate bonds of sustainable craftsmanship. The film appeals not only to fly fishers and bamboo enthusiasts, but also fans with interests in cultural heritage, meaningful work, and the beauty of our Earth's people and places. Ed George and split-cane aficionado Hoagy B. Carmichael getting the shot. Photo by Kyle George. Words and Images Built to Last Trout Grass achieved great success upon its release in 2005. The film was featured at a dozen festivals throughout North America and Europe, including the Telluride Mountain Film Festival, and Bend Film in Oregon. The producers were awarded ""Best of Festival"" and ""Audience Choice"" at several screenings. About 5,000 DVDs sold in North America during the first few years of release. The documentary aired on Public Broadcast Service affiliates throughout the western United States. But, hey, as Louis Carlozo of the Chicago Tribune noted, ""If it sounds like the stuff of a public-TV yawner, guess again: [David James] Duncan wastes nary a word as he tackles his subject with a poet's passion and reporter's zeal."" The film never grows old. Its pace is as soothing as the flow of mountain streams. And like the meticulously crafted split cane fly rods on display in the film, the writing, cinematography, and music are each created by masters of their art.

I�m a singer/songwriter & worship leader based out of Fort Worth Texas. THE DREAM I�m very excited to invite you to join me as I embark on a journey that will be the fulfillment of a dream that God has been unfolding over the last few years: to record my first worship record experience and to do it as an independent artist, with my friends and family as the lifeblood. THE JOURNEY Worship is where it all began for me. As a young girl, it was just me with my guitar, singing simple songs of freedom over people and humbly watching as God did something extraordinary with it. Music being a vehicle for healing and the way I express worship, has always been the underlying current, even during the years of being identified as a �pop Christian Contemporary� artist. When I was 22, after a lifetime of doing ministry and working hard as an Independent artist, I was signed to a major record label, which led to two full-length albums, �You Got My Attention� and �Wanted.� I was nominated for a Dove Award for �New Artist Of The Year.� My songs were played on the radio and all over the world. I had top charting success in radio, I was on the biggest tour in the world, Winter Jam, touring with the biggest artists in Christian music for three seasons and have been traveling locally and globally doing music and ministry for the last 10 years. I give God all the glory and will forever be eternally grateful for that season. Also, that season allowed me to connect with you. I can�t ever say thank you enough for that. WATCH �WHEN ALL I HAVE IS JESUS� AFRICA VERSION HERE: https://youtu.be/tR-e8GANig0 THE NEXT STEP From signed at 22, to now 32. I�ve decided, with the blessing of my label, to step out again as an Independent artist. Over the last 10 years, I�ve learned so much about myself and what I believe my purpose is as an artist: To reveal the heart of God the Father with clarity and accuracy through music and watch as God uses that to set hearts free, and me right along with it, and to call us back to Him, to each other, and to Family. As it stands today, I�ve been blessed to be a part of a couple of projects that were released through the emerging worship family here in Dallas/Fort Worth and that really set the course for where we are now and where we�re headed with this next record. Coupled with my song, Blameless, that I wrote at 16 and released on my record �Wanted� in 2013 and then, as a live worship video on YouTube in 2015; that day LITERALLY changed my life, I knew for the rest of my life, I wanted to write simple songs and see God move. WATCH BLAMELESS HERE: https://youtu.be/g1BB6Uq6PGk THE NEW ALBUM Full circle, this next record will be filled with simple, vulnerable, authentic songs about love, freedom, family and God as Father, allowing Him Full Access into every room in our hearts, until the whole house that is us gets healed. I CANNOT WAIT to share this new music with you and even more, I can�t wait to do this with you as a family, and together take this message all over the globe. THE BUDGET I want to invite you to be a part of this album, this journey, this next step. I know we can make something amazing if we do it together. We have 30 days to raise the funds to cover the following: studio sessions producer/engineer musicians mixing and mastering disc manufacturing social media marketing Kickstarter fees & costs THE STRETCH GOAL As you know, Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing kind of deal. My initial campaign goal is set at $35K to cover the costs for recording this album, which I totally believe with your help we can meet. Our stretch goal is $55k. As you know, video content is a huge connection point for people so I want to be able to create visual representation for the songs as well as implement a marketing campaign to reach the masses. BUT the dream doesn't stop there. Anything I raise beyond the stretch goal will get me closer to being able to tour with this album, and create ""Encounter Nights"" locally and globally. THE SHARE Online marketing is KEY for today's Independent artists. It�s the just the world we live in, so, my goal is to have social media work for us in it�s true purpose: getting things that edify and uplift into the hands of every person we can. You and I, are more than enough to make a massive wave for the Kingdom. Thank you in advance for spreading the word, posting, reposting, telling your friends and doing anything in your heart to do to get this message out with me! THANK YOU That�s the dream, and together, I believe we can more than do it. I pray every seed sown, would multiply back to you and your dreams. Thank you in advance for listening, praying, giving and supporting in anyway that�s in your heart. It means the world to me. So much love, - D"

A meditation on the way humans relate, communicate, listen and see. The characters domino from a filmmaker attempting to write a script, to a blind girl trying to find an energy beyond the school walls around her and finally to a mechanic aimlessly driving around the mountain roads trying to find a reason to live, all against the landscape of Lebanon. Short Summary Art is not for judging, but made for thinking. Karim Kassem is a young director and cinematographer from Beirut living in New York City and will be playing himself. Lyne Ramadan is the young blind girl who will be playing herself, thinking of a world outside the school walls. Fouad Mahouly will be playing himself as a mechanic wandering around the mountains, looking for a better reason to live. The Lebanese School for the Blind will be our main location, to uncover the charm and vision of the children there. Contributions will support our collective vision and bring it to life in the shape of cinema. The Impact What we are trying to do, is create art in a realm that exists between both sighted and non-sighted individuals. Stylistically, the film bends more towards an experimental narrative that sits well with our dreams. A meditative experience dissolving into a soundscape while reflecting inward on the notions of thought and existence."

When possible, the interviews will be conducted at the location of the sighting/encounter. The researchers and filmmakers will be spending several days on location filming a Bigfoot expedition and performing experiments to prove or debunk witness testimonials. The most significant challenge facing the filmmakers will be adapting to quickly changing weather conditions. It is anticipated that most, if not all filming will take place outside in mountainous terrain during early summer. Jim Myers, Bigfoot researcher and producer, is adamant that the Bigfoot community be invited to participate in the making of this film. ""This isn't going to be a fan film though, says Jim. ""We will have non biased professionals as part of the crew as well. ""We are going to craft this film into a story that Bigfoot enthusiasts and skeptics alike will thoroughly enjoy, and come away from with an entirely new perspective on the Bigfoot phenomenon"" , says Jim. Jim and the filmmakers invite Bigfoot researchers, witnesses and enthusiasts to be a part of this game changing film by supporting �Backwoods� on Kickstarter.com. If nothing else, says Jim, ""we hope to bring a bit of wonder into this world"". ""So, we�ve only just started. It�s time to get back to work. Thank you for your unflinching support."

Watch this video below: it goes over the whole Ferris System in more detail and with more clarity� and shake testing� than our campaign video! If you're like us, you try keeping things tidy� but you still waste time every day looking for your wallet, phone, keys and sunglasses. To create a better out-the-door experience, we've reimagined a way to organize and carry these everyday essentials. Ferris KeyLoop, KeyFolio, and ModWallet in action� all powered by MagLock Our mission at Distil Union is to create products that solve life's little frustrations in a way that makes you smile. We're an independent design studio that's fueled entirely by crowd-funding since 2012 (this is our 9th Kickstarter� all successful and delivered on time )! For years we've heard what hundreds of you struggle with when it comes to the stuff you walk out the door with every day� so we've distilled the problem into an elegant solution which, of course, involves magnets... As it turns out, the best key ring isn't a ring at all. Keys rotate freely, and attach to any magnetic surface. (Shown: KeyLoop) Built for those of us always on the go, Ferris makes life a little bit easier by improving the things you carry and how you store them. Shown: Ferris KeyLoop, ModWallet and ModStation It�s time to retire the keyring for something more fun and flexible. Ferris is a series of secure magnetic components that easily come together and quickly reconfigure as needed. Powered by MagLock, you can slim down and carry only what you need in an instant� no more, no less, and no tools required. There are many solutions that have tried to tackle the problem of organization, but they come with their own problems or create other issues... We've grown accustomed to compromises and trade-offs, but these little frustrations really add up! We wanted to reclaim that time, and our sanity... A simple solution is long overdue: We're passionate about designing products that simplify your life in clever ways, and after years of exploration and development, we've created a simple modular system named Ferris. Streamline your routine. Walk out the door with lighter pockets, and leave the rest neatly organized on the Ferris ModStation� a modern catch-all for your most common out-the-door items. This is Ferris, a hassle-free system of everyday essentials. Ferris lets your wallet and keychain adapt to what you need to carry� eliminating clutter and increasing peace of mind. We set out to create a better key organizer, and arrived at a system that's more than simply functional� Ferris saves you time and space, and adapts to your life in a fun and meaningful way. That's why Ferris is all about customization� there's no longer a need to carry different solutions. Instead, make what you carry work for you: The Ferris leather-goods include KeyLoop, KeyFolio, and ModWallet Ferris KeyLoop KeyLoop: Carry up to 6 keys + included FobRing holds your car fob, tracker, etc. Ferris KeyFolio KeyFolio: Carry up to 10 keys + included FobRing holds your car fob, tracker, etc. Ferris ModWallet ModWallet: Comes with one CardSleeve to carry up to 12 cards, and a MoneyClip for your cash. Also carries add-ons like additional CardSleeves, KeyMods, USB and MultiTool. Grab a cover that suits your style and accommodates your carry, or pick a combination that adapts to meet your specific needs from day to day (this is the ideal solution for those of you who have multiple sets of keys, but you don't need to have them all on you all the time). Imagine the possibilities! Ferris comes together to suit your needs on a daily basis. You can easily stack and rearrange� even combine your keys and wallet into one consolidated carry so you have one less thing to remember. Scale up or down. Carry only what you need� no more, no less, and no tools required! Ferris is powered by our patent-pending MagLock. This magnetic locking mechanism gives you the perfect balance of security and access that so many key-organizing solutions fail to provide. Free a key instantly to easily swap out + share as needed. Ferris leathergoods work with KeyMods� the heart of the Ferris family. They are made with neodymium magnets and a TPU-backed nylon, well-known for its durability and abrasion resistance. Behind these small mechanisms are years of development and testing to achieve a connection that is: SECURE In your pocket, your bag, dropped on the ground, taking a tumble down the stairs... Your keys will remain securely snapped together. FLEXIBLE Magnets join together quickly and easily. They rotate smoothly for key access without removal, and allow for sharing without the need for a tool. KeyMods shown with USB, FobRing, MultiTool, MoneyClip and a ModWallet cover. The KeyMods work like double-sided magnetic snaps: Nesting magnets with a male/female construction make a magnet-to-magnet connection that's incredibly strong and allows for rotation. This new MagLock works differently than our MagLock Sunglasses, redesigned and optimized for keys to snap together and rotate. In order to accommodate the majority of keys that people carry, we created two types: KeyMod Clicks and KeyMod Sticks. View the Key Guide and video to learn how they work with your keys in our first Update. Any larger keychain items (like a car fob, Tile tracker, or sentimental boondoggles) can be kept on the custom-designed FobRing included with the KeyLoop and the KeyFolio.  Made to last, with durable materials that feel great in your hand� and look great in your home. It all comes together with the Ferris ModStation: A sleek and modern catch-all that gives everything a proper place. Cutting visual clutter not only saves your sanity: ModStation helps you stay organized reduces the likelihood of lost items makes your out-the-door routine quicker and easier ModStation is an easy way keep your desk organized and tidy. Shown here with a KeyLoop used to hold headphones, and ModWallet. Ferris ModStation is so much more than a mail-catch. We call it a ""catch-all"" because the slim steel tray is designed to accommodate your phone, a Kindle, a notebook, and other similarly sized items ModStation will even hold onto your phone's charging cable so it's always there when you need it� instead of falling behind your desk or getting lost entirely... Shown here: ModStation with KeyFolio and MagLock Sunglasses (our successful 2017 Kickstarter!) ModStation is made of steel with a smooth powder-coat finish. Easy to mount where you need it, all ModStations include a set of screws as well as a panel of 3M removable adhesive that's also magnetic (so you can mount ModStation to any magnetic surface, like a fridge or steel door). Shown here: ModStation with ModWallet. BONUS: Ferris leathergoods instantly hold anything magnetic, like AirPods. Stop searching for your stuff. Streamline your routine. And take back your time. Everyone's needs are different, and we're excited to hear how Ferris adapts to meet yours :) Any surface that could use tidying up, could use a ModStation. KeyMod MultiTool (including bottle-opener) and KeyMod USB (16GB) are available as Add-Ons to any Pledge Level. MagLock Sunglasses are available as Add-Ons to any Pledge Level (choose style after the campaign). DIY: How to Customize Your Ferris Ferris is modular.

Check out the Ferris Carry Guide� count what you carry, then click to enlarge: - click to enlarge - We've been designing products (and eating noodles) together for over a decade, and this is our 9th Kickstarter� our very first was in 2012, when our Snooze iPhone Stand literally kickstarted our new business. The excitement and feedback we receive from the crowd-funding community plays an integral role in how we bring new products to the market. We've delivered on every single Kickstarter, so you can feel confident backing this project. Our small, independent business is powered by crowd-funding since our first Kickstarter in 2012! For the past two+ years, we've gone through countless prototypes to refine our ideas and work through all the details. We've listened to what frustrates you about your daily items, and we're excited to share our hard work with you� and for Ferris to make a difference in your everyday. The Ferris Collection is our biggest undertaking to date, and we're back on Kickstarter because we need your help. We're seeking the funding that we need for materials and manufacturing for the first Ferris production run. We're working with trusted manufacturing partners whom we've worked with before� and in January we relocated to Asia so we can be close to the factory to ensure everything runs smoothly. As production progresses we'll keep you informed along the way, and let our Backers in behind the scenes with updates while we work to bring Ferris to life. We bounce between Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Tokyo to make Ferris the best he can be. #digitalnomads Last but not least: We need your help to get the word out about Ferris� every share helps! We're super excited to be back on Kickstarter with you, and we truly hope Ferris makes your life a little easier :) Distil Union Co-Founders Press coverage for Distil Union product designs *toots own horn* ~ cheers! ~ Nate and Lindsay would like to thank our friends and family while they've been on this tireless product-development adventure across the globe! A special shout-out to those who made this campaign possible: Josh Kozono: Video Production, Lighting, Sound, and Editing.

Rebecca Pollett: Customer Support and Charleston Office The Mills Fabrica: Co-Working Studio and Prototyping Lab in Hong Kong Rebecca in Charleston, SC, USA - Josh Kozono in Tokorozawa, Japan TIMELINE for Production and Delivery Testing and shooting has all been done with hand-made samples. This allows us to make big changes and little tweaks along the way; the latest set of samples (what you see in the video) is incredibly close to what Ferris will be in production. To get these samples and stay on schedule, we were down to the wire, but our fantastic team made it happen (including a dash around Tokyo to locate the right FedEx)! Here's a basic schedule so you can see what our projected delivery date will be: MAY = Kickstarter campaign begins! JUNE = We can initiate tooling during the campaign, giving us a head start on elements of production which take more time, like ordering materials and making the tools needed to create components. JULY = The first in-production samples will be approved; we will inspect at the factory. AUGUST = Production is completed; we will inspect at the factory. Products in packaging will ship to our US warehouse. SEPTEMBER = Delivery to Backers begins! Subject to change� of course, we'll let you know of any unexpected surprises (good or bad!) This round of samples we photographed for the Kickstarter look great, and they're only going to get better as we move closer to production� with your help! Thanks to all who have shared your thoughts and experiences with us over the years� this one's for you!

NASA selected the Sea of Tranquility near the equator of the moon for the first lunar landing attempt. Durning the decent, Neil and Buzz overshot the intended landing site and had to maneuver around a large crater and boulder field. Upon touch down, they had less than a minute of fuel remaining. This 3D map allows you to explore the depth and size of the obstacles in the last seconds along the flight path. It also added depth to what it might have been like standing next to a 30m wide impact crater or placing the science experiments that were left behind to collect valuable information of our moon. I now look at lunar surface photos with greater understanding of location, vantage points and scale with this 3D map as a table top reference. Photo credit: NASA To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we are creating The Apollo 11 Site Map. Size: 10�x 5.75� Made from high quality clear acrylic in 3D Accurate locations and scale Labeled items of interest- Flag, TV Camera, LM, LRRR, SWC, PSEP, and Craters Utilizing the highest resolution images of landing site and NASA maps Made in the USA Mapping a distant world To create an accurate map of the landing site, we utilized the closest satellite images of the surface, NASA maps and panoramic images taken during the EVA. From this data, combined with mission notes, we were able to accurately layout the locations of artifacts, where the astronauts explored and the depth and locations of significant craters. Photo credit: NASA Photo showing science experiments, LM, Flag and TV camera Photo Credit: NASA Mapping since the Apollo era Seeing the landing site from earth or space based telescopes is simply not possible because of the limitations of optics. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has provided much closer images and topography of the moon's surface. Hopefully, the recently announced return missions to the moon will not only advance our exploration, but expand our images of this historic site. Photo from LOR (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) Collectors Accessory Bag This bag is based off of the original Contingency Bag used to stow the first samples collected on the moon. We're bringing it back to this project by popular request. Made from heavy weight nylon, brass zipper and original NASA lettering, it is the most authentic way to store your lunar treasures until you collect you own moon rocks. *All items will be shipping from the United States via USPS First Class Mail. Duties and taxes are the responsibility of the recipient. Meet the Creator Six years ago I launched my first kickstarter that evolved into an international bag business, that I still run today.

My name is Lucas Alvarado and together with a group of my friends, we are putting together a new tech company called Interop Technology. What is Interop Technology? Interop Technology is your stop for all of your tech needs. We have different services from creating and developing websites, to writing content and editing marketing videos. We came up with this idea because the 4 of us are Software developers and we have created websites and designs for most of our friends already. We want a way to reach more people and new customers and at some point work full time only on Interop Technology not just all night (coders do not sleep). Our plan is to provide an excellent quality product at a reasonable price. We can provide a better price for our customers as we do not have to outsource any of our services. We each have special skills on everything we offer and can guarantee satisfaction. Our main goal is to be able to run our own company, work only on Interop Technology, and rent a small shared office space. 80% of the money pledged will go towards advertising on social media and PPC on Google. Once we reach this goals, you are all welcomed to come visit us! 80% of the money pledged will go towards advertising on social media and PPC on Google. The more people that see our projects and designs, the more satisfied customers that we will be able to acquire."

I can't imagine the man I would be today without the women in my life. We live in a time when the woman is underappreciated for the beauty, strength, poise and nuance she brings to humanity. I wrote 8 original compositions honoring the women in my life who continue to shape me completely as a man. Back in February 2019, I was lucky enough to book a week long residency at Dizzy's Club New York. I called the residency Songs About Women, and performed these songs with my band for the FIRST time. The response? Well... Around 500 people from all over the world attended the residency. On both weekend nights, the venue was packed out the door. We sold out! After one of those nights, two Londoners spoke to me about how moved they were by the song I wrote called JUSTICE, which I wrote for my twin sister: Justice. Shout out to my sis and those two lovely Londoners! Last night of my residency at Dizzy's Club New York MY OBJECTIVE With these 8 songs, I can tell the story I've always wanted to share since I first started making music. So I asked myself: why not tell the story through my first jazz album?! EXECUTING THE PLAN Putting together a jazz album and getting everyone to listen to it requires real commitment. I have a strong vision for how I want to present this project. Now it's going to take a real team effort (you and I) to bring this vision to the world!!! I seriously can't do this without you. #1 We need to produce the full album. This is what that REALLY looks like: Compensating my 4 band members to record the album in a studio Feeding everyone involved in the recording process Hiring a mixer to mix 8 songs Hiring a master engineer to master 8 songs for digital and radio formats #2 We need to promote the album, which really means: Making music videos to accompany the album and hiring the crew to make it happen Performing SHOWS so I can meet you all in real life!! For the music videos, you might even get to see me throw it back to my acting days on HBO's Treme with the big bro Wendell Pierce ;) Me and Wendell on HBO's Treme In the end, I want you to feel as close to these songs as I do and share the love, memories, and New Orleans I've poured into them...with the people you cherish. Yours truly, Jeffery Miller Hugs from me to you"

The lessons of solidarity, collaboration, and creative encouragement I have received here I hold with permanent gratitude. Having had the fortune to travel broadly for musical endeavors, including time spent working and living as a musician in NYC, I�ve gained extra perspectives on the uniqueness that exists in the musical community of Ithaca. As a composer, I�m perpetually comforted knowing that there is a resource of talent here that can fulfill whatever I can dream up, allowing me the confidence to write with an open mind. I have been working on a project inspired by the hope of conveying this thankfulness. SONGS AND PLAYERS I�m honored with the opportunity to create and share a new album of my original compositions, performed and recorded by some of my favorite local musicians and closest friends. I�ve written 10 songs referencing a broad range of my musical interests, with a diverse variety of Ithaca bands and musicians in mind, including members of: Driftwood, Viva Mayhem!, The Crucials, The Thru Spectrums, Brian!, Hank Roberts, The Ithaca New Music Ensemble, members of the Horseflies and Blindspots, and more! Conceptually, I'm aiming to create a flow of music that serves to sample and pay homage to the music that inspires me in Ithaca, and to reflect these sounds through my own compositional style.

The supportiveness that I have known here in Ithaca gained an extra dimension for me in July 2010, when I was involved in a life-altering car accident. The path to recovering and persisting with my music has been the great lesson of my life thus far; I live with a daily recognition of the blessing of the people here that have instilled me with hope and purpose to maintain pursuit of what I love. My way of expressing reverence for this support is through continued musical creation."

Easy To Use Stylish Colors for All Occasions The Idea The Prototype Timing Is Everything *Note: Warming liquid from cold can take 10-20 mins The Creation of The Baby's Brew The Baby�s Brew was created on an idea from very frustrated parents. My husband and I are active and travel often. Once our daughter was born I quickly came to the realization that traveling with an infant was extremely difficult. One of the biggest struggles we had was our daughter refused to drink anything that was not warm. Trying to find warm water when out and about didn�t seem like that difficult of a task, until we tried to. If we did find someone who could warm water up for us it would always take forever or be scalding hot from the coffee machine. When you have a crying baby time is of the essence. So we went out on a search to find something that was small portable and battery powered so we didn�t get tied down to the cord. Well after hours of searching we came to the realization that this did not exist. Frustrated we were always concerned when going out and honestly missed out on a lot of things just because we were scared we wouldn�t be able to find warm water near us. Stay Charged, Stay Ready! For parents on the go, the built-in USB charging feature makes for total convenience. You never need to worry about your Baby's Brew running out of power and leaving you without a means to prep your child's meal. This is the reliable solution that you have been waiting for. Wherever you can charge your smartphone or tablet, you can charge the Baby's Brew too. The Importance for Slow Heating When creating The Baby's Brew I had envisioned this bottle warmer that would hear a bottle in less than a minute! Well after much thought and testing this just was not what anyone would want. Warming this fast can cause hot spots and accidental overheating! Which was not on our agenda to help parents. So like they say, ""slow and steady wins the race!"" The Baby's Brew can heat up any liquid to the desired temperature from 10-15 mins and most of the time less if you have a room temp water/breastmilk. The slow heat mechanism is essential for breastmilk to ensure that the nutrition is not compromised. This is also beneficial for formula moms as well. The faster you warm up that water the more likely there will be hotspots or worse getting to hot without warning. What We Need & What You Get Right now, we have come to you, Kickstarter, for help raising the funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute he Baby's Brew on a worldwide scale. Our goal through this campaign is to raise $5,000, which will cover all the costs that we face as we offer the Baby's Brew to consumers worldwide. To say thanks to all our contributors, we are offering the Baby's Brew at a significant discount through this campaign � plus larger discounts for orders of two, three, five, and a dozen units. This is your opportunity to help us spread better, more efficient parenting far and wide. The Impact Better parenting: it seems like an abstract concept until you find something that can really help you. When something like this comes along, it has the potential to change people's entire parenting strategies and mindsets altogether. Your support will put us in a position to bring this innovative product to market! Other Ways You Can Help Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us with the Baby's Brew by sharing this campaign with all your friends and family. Go ahead and post about the Baby's Brew on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. Spread the word about what we are doing!

One of the main ways I enjoy reaching the children is by writing songs for them based on their interests. I write songs about themes in the children's lives that they share with me. Singing with children never fails to be the highlight of my day. Photo by Chris Bauer I've written songs with the children for years and finally I have decided to collect them all together and release a professional record of the sweet tunes I made. I am planning on making this my big summer project- working out the arrangements, collaborating with local accompanists, talented recording technicians, mixers, and professional CD manufacturers to create my first album of children's songs. Photo by Chris Bauer The songs I write are most often on the themes of nature, everyday life, and interesting questions children have and I love to watch how my music lights up a room when I play these songs on my guitar or banjo. My songs are soothing, sweet, and engaging with lots of fun rhyme schemes, interesting scales, and of course, always harking back to the child's innate interests. Some of the songs that will be featured on this album are ""Little Bit Chilly Outside"", ""Slithering Snake"", ""My Loosey Goosey Tooth"", ""Baby Seed"", ""Late for Work"", ""The Story of the Moth"" and ""You Are Loved by Me"". I plan to take this album around to different schools, libraries, camps, and children's museums this year and make more connections to reach more children with this uplifting and special music, and I am very excited to get to see what kind of support I can raise on Kickstarter in the next 30 days from all the people who believe in me and encouraged me to start this project long ago!

Our first book, ""The Greatest Captain in the World"" had been a vision of ours for sometime and to see it come to life after our Kickstarter campaign was a real dream come true! But, (not to sound like a stereotypical sailors or anything) there were still other stories to tell! We have worked with several tallship captains over the years who were women, and we felt it was important to honor them and other female leaders by having a woman as the captain in the sequel. That meant, of course, that the only title could be ""The Greatest Captain in the World Too."" From the very beginning we pictured the two books side by side and the two captain's eyeing each other (Perhaps there's a story there too?) Our old team is back for the sequel so it should be as good or even better than the original. We have (from left to right) Johann Steinke (a tallship captain who loves stories and rhyme), Joel Ruud (an amazingly gifted story teller), Megan Allison Steinke (video wizard and new mother!), and Andy Catling (the professional illustrator from England) The Greatest Captain in the World Too is going to begin with an immigrant family out at sea in a storm. The sailors are telling the family stories about how great their captain is, in order to ease their worries. There will be different scenery, colors, weather, stories, sailor activities, etc. And yet, because it has the same team at work on the book, it will have a very similar look and feel to the original as well. Special Features Just like the original book, the new book will feature: Beautiful Illustrations Example from the original book Glossary of Sailing Terms Example from the original book And the crew dealing with everyday problems and situations that anyone could relate with: Example from the original book ADD $15 TO YOUR PLEDGE AND GET THE ORIGINAL ""THE GREATEST CAPTAIN IN THE WORLD"" BOOK If you never got a copy of our original book ""The Greatest Captain in the World"", you can add a signed copy to your pledge for only $15 more. Increase your pledge by $15 and we will know to add one copy of the original book to your order. The Original Book What will my support go towards? The funds we are raising are to pay Andy for his professional work, as well as to pay for the printing and shipping of the first 2,000 copies of the sequel. Illustrating of the Book: $7,000 Layout of the Book: $650 Cost of Printing and Shipping 2,000 Books: $7,850 GRAND TOTAL: $15,500 A lot of people ask, if your first book was successful then why do you need to raise funds with a Kickstarter? Well, the success of the first book will go to paying for the printing and shipping of the next batch of that original book, which we are close to being out of. Mostly though, a Kickstarter Campaign is a great way to give our supporters something special, before anyone else will be able to receive it. Also, a Kickstarter Campaign helps get the word out about the book to others who might not otherwise hear about it. Lastly, if our campaign proves to be very successful and we meet our stretch goal, then it means we will be able to give away hundreds of books to young children and students who might not have the chance to receive such a book otherwise. Stretch Goal Our stretch goal is $22,500 to enable the printing of 5000 books (many of which will be given away to children and students in need). We actually printed 5000 of the original book and have gone through almost all of them!!"

Let's make it happen so that BUGS 'N BOO HAGS can be ported to Nintendo Switch for a planned release in 2020! Bugs 'N Boo Hags is an award-winning video game that's all about the place I call home�the seaside city of Beaufort, located in the ""Lowcountry"" region of coastal South Carolina. Hi there! My name is Brian Canada. I'm a college professor, graphic designer, and game developer from Beaufort, South Carolina. For the past four years, I've been independently creating Bugs 'N Boo Hags, which combines the challenge of tower defense with the intensity of single-screen platform jumping and climbing action. Bugs 'N Boo Hags is very much a love letter to the classic games that I grew up playing at arcades, pizza joints, and convenience stores in the 1980s. It's got original pixel art, chiptune music, and that ""just-one-more-time"" kind of gameplay which are all authentic to that era, the ""Golden Age"" of video games. But Bugs 'N Boo Hags isn't just another retro indie game -- in fact, I'd like to think that it's unlike any game you've played before! To my knowledge, there aren't that many commercially-available video games that have been based on or otherwise influenced by an actual place and its people and traditions as what you'll find in Bugs 'N Boo Hags. This not only makes for a surprisingly unexplored area for videogame storytelling and gameplay, but it also resonates really well with audiences that have an appreciation for traditions, folklore, or just visiting historic places. Not only that, but the involvement of the community has helped to make the game an authentic Lowcountry experience! Ever since I started working on the game four years ago, I've been more than a little obsessed with finding ways to turn all of these elements of Lowcountry life and lore into pixel-art versions of themselves. Nearly everything about how the game looks and plays is inspired by the history, culture, and folklore of the South Carolina Lowcountry, particularly from the historic seaside city of Beaufort and the surrounding Sea Islands, where I live and work. Image credited to Skyview Aerial Solutions. Used with permission. Beaufort is widely considered to be one of the best small towns to live and to visit in the American South. It's got the romantic scenery of live oaks draped in Spanish moss, salt marshes and tidal creeks, cabbage palmetto trees, distinctively charming architecture, a culture of both old and new Southern cuisine, and hundreds of years' worth of American history that dates back to some of the earliest known European settlements. The ubiquitous mossy oaks and sabal palmetto trees are visual hallmarks of the South Carolina sea islands. (Rightmost image modified from ""Live Oak with Spanish Moss on Daufuskie"" originally created by Wikimedia user Cochrane21. Usage and modifications permitted under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license) However, this bustling and beautiful coastal town that's located halfway between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia � right in the middle of the Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor � is also a hotbed of supernatural phenomena, replete with tales of haunts and spirits that have been told and retold for generations. And one of these stories, in particular, provided the seed from which my video game, Bugs 'N Boo Hags, has grown. About nine years ago, I was getting ready to start my career as a professor of computational science at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, also known as ""USCB."" I was doing some research on the Lowcountry so I could learn about places to visit, things to do, and generally what makes this area unique. Now, I don't exactly remember how I stumbled onto it, but there was an image I found on the web that depicted a sort of ""satirical map"" of what people in each state feared the most. For most states it was the usual suspects: aliens, vampires, ghosts, zombies� but for South Carolina, the map was labeled with a phrase I hadn't seen before -- ""Boo Hag."" I don't know if it was the way those two words seemed to pair together so perfectly, but I was immediately intrigued, and I ended up developing a bit of a hobby around amassing as much knowledge about Lowcountry hags, haints, and hoodoo as I could get my hands on. The more I learned about this and other Lowcountry folktales and other supernatural phenomena, the more I began to believe that the combination of stories and scenery unique to this area would make a fun backdrop for a video game. After brainstorming a few possibilities, I eventually came up with Bugs 'N Boo Hags, which places you in this strange world. The story of the ""Boo Hag"" and its many variations represent just one slice of a vast treasury of folk tales once told by the Gullah Geechee, a population of African-Americans living along the southeastern coast of the U.S. who descended from the enslaved persons freed during the civil war. Mayor Billy (right), based on the real-life mayor of Beaufort, the Honorable Billy Keyserling, enlists Sheriff McCleary to help rid Beaufort County of the Boo Hag once and for all! You play the role of Jack McCleary, a fictionalized version of James Edwin McTeer, who in the mid-20th century was the real-life ""witchdoctor sheriff"" of Beaufort County who used his own brand of hoodoo and ""folk magic"" to reverse the effects of dark spells and roots and hexes that had been placed on the people who he was sworn to protect. Your objective: As Sheriff McCleary, you must defend the homes of your citizens from invasion by that most dreaded of evil spirits, the Boo Hag. Also appearing in the game is Mayor Billy, based on the real-life mayor of Beaufort, the Honorable Billy Keyserling. Mayor Billy recruits and trains you to defeat the Boo Hags, and he provides you with useful advice throughout the game. The Boo Hag resembles an ordinary female by day, but after the sun goes down at night, she slips out of her skin, which gives her the power to fly around town and sneak into the houses of her unsuspecting victims so she can drain their life-force away while they sleep. The Boo Hag and her coven of fellow hags know you're out there to try and stop them, so they have recruited an army of creepy critters common to South Carolina -- merciless mosquitoes, perilous palmetto bugs, and ferocious fire ants! These nuisance bugs will constantly pursue and pester you while the Boo Hags slowly and steadily progress towards the house that they've targeted for invasion. Conventional weapons won't work on the boo hag�instead, your arsenal consists of corn brooms, salt shakers, and a supply of what people here in the Lowcountry call ""haint blue"" paint. If you place a broom in a boo hag's path, she'll eventually pick it up and obsessively count all the bristles, which is a great way to temporarily distract her from getting in the house. If you're able to shake a few grains of salt onto the Boo Hag�s skinless body, she'll be momentarily stunned by the stinging, searing pain of salt being rubbed into exposed flesh. The only guaranteed means of protecting your house from a boo hag is by painting all the doors and windows this certain shade of blue -- haint blue -- which fools the hag into thinking the house is covered in water, which she's afraid to cross. If you're lucky enough to protect the house by completely painting the doors and windows, the enraged hags will know it's just a matter of time before they will die, so they will relentlessly chase after you until sunrise. Even if the house is protected, you've gotta keep moving in order to stay alive! So if you can use these and other tools and tricks at your disposal to keep the hag outside of the house overnight, then at the break of dawn, she'll be burned up by the rays of the morning sun, and you'll have saved the day. Because I'm the game's only artist, designer, and developer, it's been up to me to do the programming needed to get the experience just right. With the primary gameplay mechanic of collecting and using ""haint paint"" and other special items to protect the house from the Boo Hags while evading all these irritating insects, what you've got in Bugs 'N Boo Hags is a unique blend of tower defense-style gameplay and old-school, single-screen platforming action, where you can run and jump from the branches of live oak trees and climb on ladders made of hanging ""Spanish moss"" as well as the distinctive bark of the sabal palmetto, the state tree of South Carolina. The finished game will have dozens of levels to challenge your skills and reflexes -- and each stage is unique. In fact, some of the level designs are based on actual houses and other historical buildings in the area. Some of the locally-inspired levels include: a Gullah ""praise house""; the famous ""Tidalholm"" mansion seen in several major motion pictures that were filmed in Beaufort; the ""Robert Smalls"" house, named for the African-American civil war hero and U.S. congressman who once lived there; the historic First African Baptist church, of which Robert Smalls was one of the earliest members; the long-abandoned Beaufort County Jail (which had a rather peculiar art deco design); and even the vandalized ruins of the old Seacoast Packing Company, better known to locals as the ""Old Pickle Factory."" The historic ""Tidalholm"" mansion, featured in several Hollywood motion pictures, makes an appearance as the house you must defend in one of the final stages of BUGS 'N BOO HAGS! The USCB Center for the Arts is the host location for the Beaufort International Film Festival (one of FilmFreeway's 100 ""Best Reviewed"" film festivals in the world!), but you may also recognize it as the ""Gump Medical Center"" in the 1994 Oscar winner for Best Picture, Forrest Gump! The old ""Art Deco"" jail, located on King Street in Beaufort's northwest quadrant, is a spooky abandoned structure that's a perfect place for Boo Hags to make mischief! The Seacoast Packing Company, more affectionately known to locals as the old ""Pickle Factory,"" is a mysterious abandoned building located along Beaufort's Spanish Moss Trail. A ""pixel art"" version of the structure will be the setting of one of the bonus stages in BUGS 'N BOO HAGS. I was able to create all of the game's sound effects myself, but for the music, I've had the great pleasure of working with my sister, Amy Canada, who is a classically trained performer and composer. To provide her with appropriate inspiration, I had her listen to classic NES game music written by legendary composers like Koji Kondo and Hirokazu ""Hip"" Tanaka. Amy ended up delivering her own unique and memorable themes, which she has brought to life using authentic chiptune-reproduction tools like Pulseboy and Famitracker. Check out this 60-second sampler of several music tracks from the game: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 It's been a lot of fun getting people and businesses from Beaufort County involved in different ways: Many of the levels are based on house plans created by Allison Ramsey Architects, a local architecture firm here in Beaufort, whose award-winning home designs are found all over the Southern United States and beyond. One of the special power-up items in the game, the ""Kazoobie kazoo,"" pays tribute to the only remaining manufacturer of plastic kazoos in the United States � which happens to be located right here in Beaufort! The real-life mayor of Beaufort, the Honorable Billy Keyserling, appears in the game as a helpful guide! The Whitehall house is one of the many levels in the game that are based on original designs by the award-winning architects at Allison Ramsey, based in Beaufort, South Carolina The ""Kazoobie Kazoo"" is made by the only remaining plastic kazoo manufacturer in the United States, and they're based in Beaufort. So, we made the kazoo a power-up in the game! I am thankful for the support of the family of the famous ""High Sheriff of the Lowcountry,"" the late Ed McTeer, who provided the inspiration for Sheriff Jack McCleary, the game's main character. I'm also grateful to the artists and storytellers Bernice and Andy Tate, who have a deep knowledge of hoodoo traditions and stories from this area, as well as Victoria Smalls, who has been a wonderful subject matter expert regarding the traditions, language, and culture of the Gullah Geechee community. After nearly four years of working on this project on my own and in my spare time, I'm ready to ask for your help so I can share this interactive and fun Lowcountry experience with everyone. Please note that these percentages are based on our planned funding goal of $7,100. These percentage allocations may be adjusted if the campaign is funded well beyond our goal. I've been working on Bugs 'N Boo Hags in my spare time for nearly four years, all while teaching full time as a professor in the computer science department at the University of South Carolina Beaufort. These past four years have been challenging, but I have learned so much about what it takes to create a video game on your own, and apart from having my sister write the music, I've never really asked for help. Finding the time and energy to work on the game after a long day of teaching has never been easy, so your support and encouragement is essential to the project's success. Since I don't teach classes in the summer, I currently have the extra time I need to finish the game. Therefore, I'm planning to release the completed game worldwide in September 2019 for Windows, Mac, and Linux, initially via the Steam digital game distribution service. If funding happens to greatly exceed my goal, then I will do my best to port the game to other platforms as well, such as the Nintendo Switch, and perhaps other consoles as well! The development of the game is largely complete. Your support will help to cover the costs of designing any remaining levels, testing and debugging, legal protections (trademark filings, licensing agreements, etc.), marketing, advertising, and digital distribution, as well as the creation and shipping of the physical rewards (all of which are being manufactured locally, right here in Beaufort County). I'll also need your help to fund internships for students where they can gain experience in testing, quality assurance, marketing, and game design. Finally, I would like help with funding my sister Amy's continued involvement as the composer and arranger of the game's music. Perhaps even more importantly, I need your input and your critique, so I've made a free PC demo of the game available at GameJolt. Click on the image below to go to the demo download page, or simply click here! This only will give you a chance to try out the game and provide initial feedback, but I hope that it also helps to assure you that the game is far enough along that it will actually get finished by the end of summer 2019. Everyone who backs the campaign at the ""Sheriff"" level ($10, or only $5 during the first 48 hours of the campaign) or at higher backer reward levels will not only get at least one free digital copy of the finished game, but in the meantime, you'll also get ""early access"" to the game's pre-release alpha and beta versions so you can see for yourself how much progress is being made. And if you back the game at one of the two highest reward levels, I'll design a level for the game that's based on your own home or perhaps your place of business! And if you back the game at the highest reward level, you'll not only have your name credited prominently as a ""Master Producer"" on the title screen, but I'll make you a playable in-game character as well! I am truly thankful for your support. I want to make a game that you'll not only love for its entertainment value and challenge but also for its unique depiction of South Carolina Lowcountry folklore and culture. And I am confident that with your support, together we can finish Bugs 'N Boo Hags and we can make the game as beautiful, engaging, and fun as the wonderful city and region that it reflects. Thank you so much... and as the locals say, ""Don't let the hag ride ya!"" Please note that while we have done our best to make sure that the mockup and prototype images depict the actual digital and physical rewards as closely as possible, the final appearance of each delivered reward may vary. In addition, all game footage and screenshots shown are from a version of the game that is currently in development; the final released version of the game may vary in appearance, sound, and/or gameplay from the development builds. Further, while we will strive to accommodate those backers who desire their likeness, home, and/or business to appear in the game, we reserve the right to refuse to depict anything that we do not feel is appropriate for our player audience. We are grateful to have a number of experts who have volunteered their time and energy to help make this project as good as it can be: Jordan Itkowitz: Game Designer and Veteran of the Game, Toy, and Amusement Industries Thomas Brush: Award-Winning Creator of PINSTRIPE and ONCE UPON A COMA Victoria Smalls: An Expert on Gullah-Geechee History, Culture, and Folklore Bernice & Andy Tate: Artists, Storytellers, and Experts on ""Lowcountry Hoodoo"" Cooter Ramsey: Award-Winning Co-Founder of Allison-Ramsey Architects"

""Every year somebody�s doing something, sometimes it gets noticed, [...] there�s a lot of film work that�s happened this year that nobody is talking about. We�ll find out 10 years from now that there was this amazing filmmaker in Dayton, Ohio and he was actually changing the ways stories are told... "" If you don't believe us, check out the interview. While Ethan Hawke probably wasn't directly talking about us, it's our goal to do just that. THIS PROJECT ""i"" is a psychological, sci-fi thriller centered around Alex, a novice tech enthusiast who gets caught in the middle of a cyber-terrorism attack that pushes his skills to the limit as he struggles to rescue his estranged wife and child. When Greg was young, him and his father would go off on tangents about stories that sparked the imagination of 'what if'. Writing their first story together when Greg was in 4th grade, Greg and his father continued to spitball ideas back and forth. The Eye, originally a short story they wrote 10 years ago, Greg took the concept and formed it into a feature with many of the original core thrilling concepts. Similar to the tangents that Greg and his dad used to go off on as a child about the possibility of ""what if""; this story's twists and turns brings excitement and drama to the screen, as well as raises the real-time questions for the audience to think about, how much we rely on technology in our everyday lives, what we are giving up for to access data faster, and what that could mean in the future. But don't just think about it...join the campaign and let us take you down that rabbit hole. PAST WORK Film making is difficult. Talent, resilience, collaboration, and a variety of other factors have to mingle together in such an intricate way for a film to be made. And that's what we love about it. You can check out some of these labors of love in the videos below. ""Paradise"" written by Anthony Chambers and Greg Kennedy. Directed by Greg Kennedy Filmed March 2017 ""Paradise"" is a psychological horror film about six strangers who wake up in a dark, desolate pit with what seems like no way out. After one of the strangers mysteriously disappears, John tries to lead the others to safety while they discover a sinister force among them impeding their progress. ""Lirium"" written and directed by Gregory R. Kennedy Filmed June 2013 Waking up in a strange field, Paul struggles to piece together in his memory where he is; or what happened and why. Discovering clues to help connect the puzzle of a heist gone wrong, Paul hopes that it isn't too late to correct his mistakes. ""Static"" written and directed by Anthony Chambers Filmed January 2014 MEET THE PRODUCERS Anthony and Greg have been working together for over ten years, but have had a friendship for more than 15 that is rooted in the passion for film. That passion led them to create. In that time they have produced short films such as ""Lirium"", ""Static"", and a collection of marketing videos through their production company The Trinity Film Group. Aside from producing their own projects, the duo has worked with many other film makers on their films, web series, and other projects. As well as writing and directing, Greg is also an accomplished theater and film actor. Ready for the challenge ahead, he is also excited to be one of the lead characters in this production. To see one of his past roles, Greg was the lead in an award winning short called ""Sinner Victim Saint"" back in 2014. As the campaign runs, we will provide more updates on the cast and crew. HOW WILL WE USE THE FUNDS FROM THIS CAMPAIGN? The funds we are raising during this campaign will help us take care of our final costs of production. We are going to be renting a location space for filming, building parts of our set, and purchasing a variety of props and equipment to elevate the film. Along with production costs, much of the money raised will go to feeding our cast and crew (an absolute must to keep everyone happy and energized). As $3,000 may seem like a lot, it covers the bare-minimum of what is really needed. We hope to surpass that goal with our stretch goals to pay for our talented cast and crew. Paying for the cast and crews' talent and expertise is something we hope to do with your help. As many have pledged their commitment to this project for the love of the craft and the excitement for the story, this campaign can repay them for their dedication to this very project. Much of what we do as independent film makers is about the love of the craft and telling stories, but the more you are able to help contribute, and the more money we raise, the more we can continue to put toward the final product on screen and give to the crew to help them pay for their everyday essentials of living: like paying the rent and feeding their families. REWARDS Now, we know this is the exciting part, and the reason many people get involved with campaigns. We are not only excited to share our story with you, and our journey, but also the rewards for your support. And, if we reach our first goal, be on the lookout for awesome stretch goal rewards!"

It is, however, a healing potion, which is almost as good. Here's your chance to get a set of 10 dice designed specifically to use for healing potions in the 5E system! Each dice is labeled 2-5, negating the need to add anything to the dice when rolling for anything except a supreme healing potion. The response I received when I unveiled my prototype of these dice on Reddit was overwhelming, showing me a demand far beyond my own meager production capabilities! As such, I've reached out to get these dice injection-molded so that I can make them available to everyone at a quality level I'm happy with. One major change these have over my initial product release is the corrected healer's symbol: These dice will bear the Rod of Asclepius instead of the Caduceus. My objective with this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to pay for a production run of these dice. They will be finished and packaged in house, as I want to verify the quality myself before I send them to anyone. Here�s what you�ll get: The beauty of this Kickstarter is that you�re backing a fully developed product, fully engineered and ready for production! I developed these dice a while ago and have been producing them in prototype-level quantities in my workshop - mainly for friends and family, as a result I know these dice throw well, and the designs you�re buying are complete and beautiful. Effectively, you know exactly what you�re getting. Each set contains ten (10) healing d4's - the exact amount you'll need if you ever get lucky enough to find a supreme healing potion. *NOTE: The boxes come without dice by default, which is why they're an add-on item. If you want to include extra dice with them, the prices are as follows: Small cherry or walnut case & bottle: $28 for the bottle, box, and two dice. Large cherry or walnut case & 5 bottles: $110 for the bottles, box, and ten dice. To add an add-on, simply add that amount to your pledge. When you receive your backer survey you'll be able to list exactly which items you added. I�m a total geek who has way too many hobbies. I�ve played D&D since 3rd Edition, and have loved seeing the community grow into mainstream. I�ve watched Critical Role ever since discovering it a few years back, and am currently involved in at least four active RPG campaigns. Looking at the giant chessboard around him, Caolan realized that there was no escape. Two of his friends had already fallen and the enemy queen glared down at him, raising her sword. Resigning himself to his fate, he fruitlessly tried to ward her off. �If only we�d brought more healing potions�� he thought as everything faded into blackness. The idea for this project ties back to a particularly costly engagement in which three members of my D&D party fell in battle, failing all our death saves and effectively wiping out half the group. My replacement character is a pure healing cleric/warlock who I made to be the ultimate combat medic. Me, being the ridiculous human being that I am, decided she should have her own unique dice. After a completely frenetic week involving significant amounts of caffeine, a decided lack of sleep, and way too much metal music and Critical Role podcasts, the healer�s dice were born. When I shared my initial prototypes for these dice on Reddit, the response I received was overwhelming. By popular demand I opened the Etsy shop I�d been toying with for a while, and sold out of the original Caduceus dice within a few minutes. I realized there was no way to keep up with demand if I was doing everything in-house, so I put together this Kickstarter to raise the money to get someone to help me produce them (and maybe bring some of my other ideas to light as well - at the time of this writing I have 67 more product ideas in my development list). The majority of these funds will go toward getting a mold and producing dice. I have some stretch goals planned (all the way to $100,000 if this entirely blows me away) to get you guys even cooler things if this goes well. Some of the money will go toward moving my tools out of my house and into a shop (currently about half of my home is configured as a workshop, and though that�s what I always thought I wanted growing up, it turns out it is not at all what I want. Careful what you wish for, kids. It�s almost impossible to stop working if you�re living in your workspace.) Extra funds will go toward getting more of these ideas on my list developed, and bringing you a huge array of completely unique RPG products!

This summer the Scrappy crew will bring the Bard's great tragedy of passion to life in the company's most raucous, irreverent, and immersive production to date. There will be screaming guitars, thumping bass, rockin' vocals and a general disregard for all authority! Why donate? We aim to do achieve two main goals through Scrappy Shakespeare, (1) Provide a free theatrical opportunity to our community and (2) provide worthwhile compensation to the artists involved. It is our belief that art is for all people and there should always be experiences that do not come with an economic barrier. We also believe that this doesn't mean that they should be of any lesser quality, and that high quality work demands that those creating it be able to dedicate great amounts of time and energy. This means that the artists must be paid. Spartanburg is growing economically at an incredible rate. As this occurs we believe it is the responsibility of the city�s cultural institutions to ensure that financial barriers do not prevent all of our citizens from engaging in our cultural landscape. We believe that the work of arts organizations providing artistic experiences at a cost must be supplemented by programs that provide similar cultural opportunities in a way that creates no financial barrier. And those programs must also consider how the programming itself can attract and meaningfully engage community members of all types and demographics. THIS CAMPAIGN IS ALL-OR-NOTHING, BABY! Which means your donation truly matters! By donating you are ensuring that we can continue to provide worthwhile artistic events to our shared community at no cost to the attendee and with fair compensation for the creators. Art is fueled by those who care and your donation makes you a part of a movement to establish Spartanburg as a viable city for artists to live and work. The Origin Story Scrappy Shakespeare is a professional level theatre company founded by a group of artists, friends, and professionally trained theatre-makers in 2015. At the time we saw that Spartanburg was responding ecstatically to new theatrical programming that was provided by the HUB-BUB and Spartanburg Little Theatre artist-in-residence, work that included reinventions of classic works, improv comedy, and new plays. We also witnessed the Spartanburg Little Theatre expanding its work to include shows that we previously thought would have great difficulty attracting an audience and doing so to huge success. ""Scrappy""? Scrappy Shakespeare is exactly what it sounds like: a fast, fun theatrical experience that uses simple and mesmerizing magic. Our work is raucous and immediate. We ask the question, ""how can a theatrical performance be more like a rock concert?"" Not just by adding music but by seeking to create the celebratory communal environment found at a good live show. Every member of the company has experience working in nontraditional ways that place the emphasis on the actor and their relationship with the audience, instead of big production values. We're looking to bring you a special kind of theatre magic--one that involves simple but mesmerizing effects, lively and engaging music, and the joy of watching a small group of actors switching between characters at the drop (or addition) of a hat."

I've done this successfully a lot of times, but it's always great to find new readers. I'm a writer, and I'd like to add some new short horror stories to my internet library, which you can find at http://www.gregstolze.com/fiction-library/ . The stories are written, and when the funding clears, I post them in a variety of formats (PDF, ePub and the .azw format of Kindle readers) under a Creative Commons license so you can share them as freely as you like. Please, click the link, read a few, see what you like! The stories in this project are dark ones, most strongly resembling Icke, Specimens, and How to Make a Book Safe. The first new story, which I'll release if we reach $500, is called The Last C+ Student. It's a post-apocalyptic story in which a global pandemic causes its sufferers to lose about one IQ point a day until they're pre-verbal and unable to operate can openers. It's like a zombie outbreak, but instead of fleeing the ravening horde, the hard part is taking care of them. The Last C+ Student is about 4,000 words long. Stretch Goal: Forgeries and Simulacra If we manage to get to $1,500, I'll add Forgeries and Simulacra. It's about 7,000 words, and more of a horror-suspense story, set at the intersection of policing, crime, and the occult. If you liked any of the stories I wrote for the DELTA GREEN fiction anthologies, you'll probably like Forgeries and Simulacra. You can get a preview of it at the first update right here. Stretch Goal: A Tale Told By An Idiot If you like experiments with form, watch me fold literature into origami by switching perspectives and repurposing footnotes to sneak ideas into your brain through the caretaker's entrance. In outline, it's the story of a cultist with Azathothic ambitions and the clued-in cops trying to stop his transformation. The irony is, each side is convinced that they're the beleaguered underdogs fighting against crazy odds. Arguably, only one of them is correct. You can read an excerpt of it in this update here. Backer Number Goal: A Podcast In Silky Stolze-Tone The number of backers seems a little bit stalled, so let's try something fun and innovative. If I get one hundred backers, then every backer gets a podcast version of me reading The Last C+ Student out loud. This isn't a financial goal, it's 100% a numbers game. If each of you current backers can convince a single pal to pledge a single dollar, we'll smash this and all of you get a special, not-available-to-the-public reading in my personal dulcet tones! (If you want a preview of said tones, you can hear 'em on my game podcast.) Backer Two Hundred Goal: Another Podcast Y'all responded to the offer of a podcast, so I'll go one better: If this project hits two hundred pledges, I'll release Forgeries and Simulacra as a podcast to backers only. In the unlikely instance that we make two hundred pledgers without hitting the $1,500 financial goal, you'll be able to hear it, but the public won't get to read it online. Honestly though, that seems... not very likely? Anyhow, if you want to hear a second story, pledge! If you've already pledged, I guess you have to encourage more people to join in! Maybe use some of that 'peer pressure' they warned me about back when I was a teen? -G."

Wait-- No! Don't shoot that guy, that's who we were here to save! Oh well, let's rewind and try again. Zoetrope is a simple to learn and fun to play, card-based time travel role playing game. You'll need 2-3+ players and a story leader, who will explain what happens in the world and how the player's actions affect the world around them. No one needs to show up to the table with any ideas of what they are doing, the various card decks help ensure even the story leader has resources to make the game unfold without any preparation. And no confusing event management-- because you will be placing cards on the table in a visual timeline, you will always know what events are changing due to time travel. You can read the full game rules here. Or maybe you'd rather a visual of how the game unfolds, and an explanation of its elements? Who would have thought time travel could be this easy? But seriously, Zoetrope is a very easy game to sit down and play. Each player is dealt a Role card, which tells them how many Action, Time, and Gear cards they get, and gives them a special ability when they travel backwards in time. Players also get Trait cards, which give them little bonuses or powers to help make each character feel a little more unique. The story leader then reveals the Starting Event from the Event deck, explaining what the time crime or mishap is, and then the players are sent back (or forward) in time to deal with the issue. The majority of the game is roleplay, but any time a player takes an action to affect the world around them, they place one of their cards in the center of the table in a row. Since the cards go on in chronological order, any time the timeline is changed, players travel forward or backwards in time, or other shenanigans happen, everyone at the table can see a visual of how the timeline transforms or is altered. The game ends when your group decides it does. It is entirely a loose and fun game designed to let your group play until the game either slows down or comes to a natural close. If you didn't get enough fun in that playthrough, give it another go! Your story leader can reveal a new Event card whenever the game starts to slow down to give you a new goal, or you can go to stop yourselves from your previous mission if your actions didn't end up fixing the timeline! I am doing all the art as collages myself as well as the design and layout, so the funding goal is just a fun number! You are helping me fund not only a first print of the game for all of you awesome backers, but also to get a few sets of the complete game for myself to take to conventions, game stores, and to give out as freebies for players at those venues. But you don't care about all that, do you? The Merch What's a Kickstarter without awesome rewards? Below you'll see the core game and the five expansions. All of these are available at various pledge tiers, but if you want a copy of any of them on their own without having to get all of the expansions, or an extra copy of the core game itself, you can add the shown amount to your pledge and send me a message to let me know what you are adding to your rewards. Additionally, there are two CUSTOM tiers where you can send me some photos to use in your own custom card that we will discuss and design together! The custom card, kickstarter-exclusive deck is sure to be a real collectors item, so consider upping your pledge to nab the custom deck as well! These are cheaper prices than the final market price when they all go live for sale on DrivethruRPG, so get them now! We is just me! I'm Dane Asmund, and I am the designer, artist, writer, layout person, marketer... etc. That means all the money is just going to one person and place. There's nothing complicated about this-- it's actually quite easy! Pledge, get an awesome time travel game, and profit! I've run and released a book of horoscopes from a raving skeleton, a TTRPG where you play in a wild and pixellated adventuring world, a TTRPG where you are reborn from the corpse of your ancestors with strange powers, and one where you play as dogs! There's also my first game book which I illustrated myself... it was... a choice. I've also ran my fair share of failed ones. What can I say, I have ambitions and no money!"

Synopsis As with all of our films, this fictional narrative is based on a series of interviews and research in order to authentically address real circumstances in the Evansville, Indiana area. A recurring theme that appears in almost all of our research and listening is the damage caused by isolation. This story emphasizes how isolation and trauma are both causes and results of substance abuse, and how the shame and social stigma of addiction drive a person further into isolation. Substance Abuse and Addiction In 2014, Vanderburgh County was ranked as the community with the most methamphetamine use in the world. Since then, methamphetamine use has dropped drastically, but Indiana continues to be the state with the 7th highest rate of drug use and addiction. According to local experts, trauma and isolation are the driving forces behind the substance abuse habits of most addicts, and substance abuse is a leading contributor to countless other issues in the community, including foster care, unemployment, infant mortality, and suicide. The goal of our next film is to further a much-needed conversation about this issue and inspire people to look past the shame and social stigma of addiction to connect with people who are isolated. Our Team Our Emmy award-winning team is led by director Chris Weatherly, a local filmmaker with over 20 years of shooting experience in both photography and video. See his director reel and other projects at www.chrisweatherly.com. Chris is joined by writer/co-producer Jonathan Boettcher, who made his screenwriting debut with the Emmy-Award-Winning short film Left Turn and has since written and co-produced Care and Left Turn II. Leah Roop joined our team during the production of Care as a producer. Having earned a BA in Broadcasting at Arizona State University, she manages many of the details that go into production like setting up shooting locations, communicating with the cast and crew, and securing props, wardrobe, and hospitality needs. Ross Chapman serves as executive producer for this team, providing vision and direction for the stories by capitalizing on his deep involvement and commitment to the Evansville community. His research and relationships within the community play a vital role during the listening phase of each film project. This film would not be possible without the help of the other excellent filmmakers, actors, and funders who join us on these projects. Past Films Our first film, Left Turn, highlights neighborhood revitalization, challenges assumptions about poverty, and encourages people to be better neighbors. It garnered widespread success, with over 160,000 views online and an Ohio Valley Regional Emmy Award. Our second film, Care, educates people about the foster care crisis in our community and has inspired many to take action in a variety of ways. This film has prompted the formation of an official foster care coalition among church leaders in the community and continues to be a valuable tool for raising awareness. Left Turn II, our most recent short film, continues the story of our first project to examine some of the ways deeply-rooted racial division in our society affects the everyday lives of people in our community. It has been used as an artful way to generate conversation around the difficult topic of racial division, and it continues to do so at screening events throughout the city and in other communities. Funding We�ve already raised most of the budget for this film, but the additional $5,000 we hope to raise will be spent hiring actors, production crew members, and renting additional equipment to improve production quality.We work hard to find as many ways as possible to save on costs so that no dollar is wasted and our budget is well-spent on an excellent film. All of our films utilize several volunteer actors and crew in free venue space in pursuit of this goal."

My name is Alex Pescador and I am the Writer and Co-creator of Rival Stars the comic along with my creative partner and best friend, Shea Robinson. We started a company which would eventually come to be called Blue Crown Comics on March 9th, 2009. The intent was to train ourselves to become comic book professionals with the goal to publish our passion project: Rival Stars. We have spent the last decade learning and refining our skills so we could do something that could rival any professional comic book, but without the major backing of a company or staff. It has been a long and hard road but we have done it. Now, we are looking to use this Kickstarter campaign to acquire the funds to print issues #1 and #2 of the comic. We have completed issue #1 in it's entirety. From art to colors to lettering and formatting. We are currently 10 pages into issue 2 and are projected to be done by the end of the summer at our current pace. We set our goal at $2,500.00 because the only thing we are looking for assistance for is the printing costs and shipping. All of the artists have already been paid on this project and we just need that last little boost to get inventory to start this endeavor in full. With your help, you can help us to fulfill a decade long goal! In exchange, you will be the first to get issues #1 and #2 of our comic. Each issue averages around 30 pages and the first two stories are nearly 60 pages of full color comic goodness! We have partnered with several other artists to do some really cool variant covers (each of which is limited to 100 total in its print run so they are going to be very rare!). We project to fulfill the delivery of the reward tiers in the beginning of November 2019. The reason we can project that is the interior art is keeping pace to be completed by August 15th. The colorist typically needs about 30-45 days for 30 pages. So that should be completed around October 1. My letter usually needs 1-2 weeks for his part and since he helps with formatting, the book is ready to go to the printer by October 15. I use a local company (to me, I'm in Arizona), and they can fulfill books in a week or two turn around typically. I am very confident with our timelines and goals because we have self-published about 8 individual comic books in the last three years to refine this process and work out all the kinks, so we are not new to this process. Rival Stars has been a passion project of mine since 2007. I have been working on and refining these characters and story non-stop since. The easy pitch is this: The stars in our Universe, the providers of light and life in this reality, are alive and sentient. They, like us, can be heroic, scared, selfish, jealous, and noble. They fear death and sometimes go to war with one another to steal each other's life force to continue living on. Each star sends our 3 gem stones to grant the life forms it has created on its planets with great power to defend themselves. Our star, the sun, or as he calls himself Solis Invictus (the unconquered sun) is a miserable little brat who's selfish ways has endangered not only himself but all of us on Earth. He has until now (April 1865 in the comic) failed to form a Star Guard to protect himself or his planets. Now, a dark power from our galaxy's distant past has awoken with the intent of eating Solis Invictus, and destroying our planet in the process. In his rush to formulate a Star Guard, he ends up with a team of people who don't like each other or get along...but will have to learn to for their mutual survival.

Autism, and the set of experiences that come with being on the spectrum, is largely underrepresented in the game industry today. Many people are raised playing these video games, but few such games have characters or stories that speak to the challenges, strengths, and experiences that they face day to day. At Social Cipher, we�re driven to respond to this absence; to give kids a way to feel seen, for their experiences to be heard, and, ultimately, to feel confident in their own stories. As a young girl with autism living in the far reaches of space, adventure is inevitable when Ava must leave the safety of her home planet in search of her missing brother. On her journey, she becomes unlikely allies with Redbraid, a pirate captain attempting to make amends with her scattered crew. In this 2D platformer, Ava uses her pirate grappling hook to swing past obstacles, discover worlds of treasure, and uncover a growing threat against the pirates of the universe. Join Ava as she builds relationships with a rich crew of colorful pirates struggling to get along in RPG-style dialogue segments. These segments give the player the ability to shape Ava�s conversations as she works to empathize and communicate with a range of unique characters�a weary cook that relies heavily on sarcasm, for example, or the ship botanist who just can�t stop talking about plants. By placing dynamic gameplay and narrative at the forefront, our goal is that a wide audience is able to engage with our game. With a Celeste-like assist mode, we aim to make the game accessible to players who may be newer to gaming, while more experienced platformers can choose to enjoy challenging gameplay. Our game also incorporates dyslexic-friendly fonts and is playable using a keyboard and mouse, or controller. Inspirations for our game include titles such as Hollow Knight and Celeste, which engage players with their tight controls and thoughtful level design. We�ve also taken inspiration from narrative-heavy games such as Mass Effect, which allow players to build meaningful relationships with the characters they encounter by allowing for different dialogue choices. With an emphasis on dynamic platforming and meaningful narrative, our game shows the journey of a girl discovering her own strengths, weaknesses, and confidence in herself. Help us tell Ava's story. Ava is brought to you by Social Cipher, a social enterprise led by a team of gamers and neuroscience geeks. Motivated by personal experience, we believe in neurodiverse inclusion through representation and empowerment. Vanessa, our pirate captain and CEO, was diagnosed with Asperger�s at age fourteen, and she and her mother worked for years, using music, movies, and games, to create her own understanding of social skills. Rallying around her story, the rest of our crew includes artists, developers, sound designers, and neuroscience researchers. Our game is anchored by interviews, user testing, and scientific research. We work closely with the autism community, including parents, kids, therapists, and educators. We also conspire with awesome mentors, including a product executive for Rock Band and Dance Central, a narrative designer at Riot Games, and award-winning social entrepreneurs and business executives. Our own accolades include being recognized as a National Geographic Chasing Genius Finalist, Halcyon Incubator Fellow, Camelback Fellow, and Global Gaming Citizen.

Whether it comes from external causes or my our own failings, we all go through pain of some kind, and these songs represent my internal conversations about that. The style of music roams around the Rock genre, but leans more Indie/Alternative Rock than Hard Rock, with one exception: If you haven't heard our single ""Spiral Down"" on Spotify, check it out below: Production If you know me, you know how I tend to put aside his own projects on the back-burner in favor of helping others realize their own visions. In truth, I've been writing and recording these songs for over 10 years now, and never finished it or released it to the public for one reason or another. As such, the recording/production of the songs are 90% there. There are a few additional elements that need to be recorded to take them to a place where I'm excited for their release, and then comes the final mix, and mastering. Once finished, I want to release the album via digital download/streaming, physical CDs, and Vinyl.

Aiming to stop the Nazi super-soldier�s quest to revive The Third Reich once and for all, a gung-ho attack ends with a jaw-dropping twist. Welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for The Atomic Thunderbolt #3! After a bit of a hiatus� WE�RE BACK! Hey everyone! It�s been a minute, but we�re back in action! After the second issue, The Atomic Thunderbolt took a bit of an extended hiatus� in fact, all of TJ Comics did. Nothing serious, nothing bad� life just happened to get in the way and I needed to re-examine some things from a creative standpoint. But we�re back on track and can report, The Atomic Thunderbolt #3 is DONE and The Atomic Thunderbolt #4 is already in production! And that's why we're here, to send The Atomic Thunderbolt #3 to the printers and then to YOU! We're also looking to speed up production on issue #4! I�m IPPY Award winning writer Kevin Powers, and I�m teaming up with artist Rowel Roque and IPPY Award winning colorist Donna Gregory to continue the revival of the greatest one-hit wonder in comic book history � The Atomic Thunderbolt. The Atomic Thunderbolt came after the height of the early-1940s superhero craze. The war was over, the Cold War had yet to begin and many superhero comics had begun to cease publication while the precursors of Marvel and DC continued to evolve. The atomic age hero made his first and only appearance in �The Atomic Thunderbolt #1� in 1946. Featured in two stories � one detailing the character�s origin and the other in a slapstick tale with two aloof scientists � The Atomic Thunderbolt disappeared and was never seen again in mainstream comics. In the 72 years since his initial publication by the Regor Company, The Atomic Thunderbolt has achieved a cult status among Golden Age and Public Domain superhero enthusiasts. I discovered him doing research for my superhero series ""ExtraOrdinary"" and have been fascinated ever since. The first issue of our revival of The Atomic Thunderbolt served as a homage and direct sequel to the original. We included a reprint of the original stories to allow readers to connect the dots and see how we honored the source material. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FIRST ISSUE! In our first chapter, Former OSS � and soon to be CIA Officer � Jay McPherson tracks down our hero who has recently been spotted all over New York City. Staging a bank robbery, McPherson confronts The Atomic Thunderbolt and extends him an offer to make a real difference. Panel from The Atomic Thunderbolt #1 In our second chapter, working with McPherson and a covert squad of commandos, The Atomic Thunderbolt has been tasked with taking out pockets of Nazi resistance that have access to secret super-weapons and hope to restart the war. Unbeknownst to our hero, the Nazis are being coordinated and led by a mysterious man known as The Baron, whose fate is uniquely intertwined with The Atomic Thunderbolt. While taking down the leftover Nazi war machine, our hero discovers a dark secret that McPherson � and the U.S. Government � has kept tightly under wraps. The third chapter picks up moments after the second ends. The Atomic Thunderbolt wants answers for the shocking secret he�s stumbled upon. What he learns from McPherson is the truth about what happened to America�s superhumans and the Nazi superhuman known as The Baron. After learning about the villain's origin, the Atomic Thunderbolt leads an all-out assault on the evil-doer's compound that results in the most shocking twist of the series! The Atomic Thunderbolt #3 cover The third issue is COMPLETE and ready to be sent to the printers! Interior pages from The Atomic Thunderbolt #3 The Atomic Thunderbolt #1 is 50 pages and features 30 pages of our original story, PLUS reprints of The Atomic Thunderbolt's first and only appearances. The Atomic Thunderbolt #2 and #3 are both 28 pages of full-color action! *Every comic comes with the option of being signed PERKS! Here's a look at the perks you'll get as a print backer! These are designed as perks for print backers because they fit neatly inside the book! However, digital backers can still get these if you want them, just let me know when the campaign ends. We've got 3 items... a 6 x 9 cover print (this goes with the prints from the previous two campaigns), a sticker of the updated Atomic Thunderbolt logo, and my personal favorite... a homage to the classic DC Comics Cosmic Cards.

I suggested to her she should write the company. She told me she did, and many other people had also complained to the company, she received a free package of wipes, but no solution. Upon looking at her package of wipes I found that it just needed some extra tension across the top of the package and some friction. That night I made my first prototype, and gave it to my friend, who was thrilled. She took it to a school function and showed it to some of the parents, they all wanted one. An interesting statistic I came across for combined baby wipes sales in the US in 2016 was 1.26 billion, I wonder how much of that was due to wasted baby wipes coming out stuck together. As I mentioned in my video there are 2 basic sized dispensing windows that are universal through the wet wipe packages, the regular, which is 8.8 cm and the small sized which is 7 cm in length, so I have 2 different sized wafers to accommodate this. Since my first prototype I have spent the past year doing prior Arch searches on the USTPO web site and still can't find any patent for what I have created. So I did my CAD drawings and 3D renderings and sent it to my manufacturer. We are ready to go with the One Wipe Wafer. We just need your help to do it. I also mentioned in the video about the Just One Wipe product line, I have working prototypes for 4 other common wipe packages which I am also looking forward to launching."

My name is Jonzel Hernandez. I'm an actor and screenwriter trying to put myself out there by creating original content to share with the world. This is one of few projects I'm trying to bring to reality: a web-series. I started this project to add credits and build my resume. However, as I began enlisting more creative people to the production team and cast, I decided to not only build my career and share my content with the world but to also teach and help jump start the careers of others trying to break into the industry. Here is a short synopsis of the story. Title: The Former Life of Darren Mendoza Synopsis: Darren Mendoza's life is a mess. He's been dumped, his acting career is in the slumps, his house is a mess, and to make matters worse; he just got fired. After coming home from work, Darren is visited by James, who claims to be Darren's past life. What starts out as two strangers bickering, the two young men begin to form a strong friendship as James helps Darren navigate and reorganize his life for the better. I'm very excited and passionate about this project because part of the story stems from my life. It's both funny and touching, and I'm sure everyone will enjoy these two characters and their story. The funding that you provide will ensure our production has a budget to film a test pilot. If the pilot is successful and gains enough followers and views, we will put out a Patreon page for continued donations. Each of your donations will go into funding for food for the production, costumes, production costs (design, rentals, etc.). Any amount that you can donate is very much appreciated. Thank you so much for your time and consideration and I can not wait to share this project with you all!"

Our goal is to present an evening of dance that showcases the talent and breadth of the Twin Cities area professional dance community, emphasizing diversity in style, perspective, and aesthetics. The Twin Cities has a long and rich history of being a supportive place for all kinds of dance artists to live, collaborate, and create. Unfortunately, despite this great wealth, opportunities to create and present work have significantly diminished over recent years, due largely to the shuttering of many dance venues, and the disappearance of their programs. Most of these venues not only provided opportunities for choreographers to present full-length productions, but also had programs for presenting evenings of short works by multiple choreographers. With this project Hauss Dance seeks to help fill the gap. Rather than reach out to our own connections and colleagues with similar aesthetics, we have established a juried showcase to demonstrate the rich and varied artistic perspectives that exist within this vibrant and well established dance community. This year's selected artists include: Tori Casagranda, Lily Conforti, Jennifer Glaws, Samantha Heggem, Julianna Johnson, Zo� Koenig, Jos� Luis, Alys Ayumi Ogura, Jill Patterson, Charlotte Vail, and Christian Warner. This year's selection panel included dancer/choreographers Jesse Schmitz Boyd and MerSadies McCoy. Last year, for Inbox@ArtBox 2018, Sarah Hauss and Jennifer Isle donated their administrative time, our stage manager agreed to barter her time for rehearsal space, Paul Herwig slashed his rates as a technical director/lighting designer, the dance artists agreed to perform for only $100 stipend and Off Leash Art Box slashed their rental rates nearly in half to make the project successful. This year, we have a $5000 Metropolitan Regional Arts Council Community Arts Grant and we are so very excited! But, to make the budget work and to pay everyone a fairer price, we still need $1100 to round out the budget. Will you help us?"

STRETCH GOAL #2 - If we get 400 backers by the end of our campaign Ytasha will do an Audiobook!!! This Kickstarter project is a set of 3 short books about characters traversing through time in one of America's most iconic African-American communities. We explore a fantastic and speculative world, where people in the past and present are engaged in creating compelling new futures! SYNOPSIS: It�s 1951 in Chicago�s Bronzeville and a spaceship sighting has everyone buzzing. Bonnie, a 20something artist/columnist with the Chicago Defender, covers a not so secret society of people who dissect speculative science theories and the realm of the paranormal. Bonnie�s fascinated by this world of eccentrics introduced to her by a mysterious, handsome poet named Mandalay whose freedom she envies. The society meets in the basement of a slaughterhouse. However, when a blue haired pansexual pleasure activist from the future presents the attendees with the opportunity to live in the 2020s, Bonnie must decide whether life in the Alter Destiny is real or a dangling fantasy. A Spaceship in Bronzeville is a project published by Mouse Books and is was written by Ytasha L. Womack. ABOUT YTASHA Ytasha is an author, Afrofuturist theorist, filmmaker, dance therapist and champion of the imagination. She's author of the book Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci Fi & Fantasy Culture, a Locus Awards Nonfiction Finalist. She's also author of the Rayla Universe series. as well as the nonfiction books Post Black and Beats, Rhymes and Life, What We Love and Hate About Hip Hop. She's lectured at numerous colleges and festivals all over the world. She is a Spring 2019 creative-in residence at Kickstarter and 2018 writer-in-residence with Emerson College in Boston. Much like Bonnie, she got her start as a journalist at The Chicago Defender. Although her families Chicago roots began in Bronzeville, she personally has not seen a spaceship there... although she's met people who claim they have. EXPLORING BONNIE'S WORLD Chicago South-side, 1950s Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood was one of the great destinations for African Americans escaping hardships in the South during the first half of the 20th Century. Our story's protagonist, Bonnie, lives and works in Bronzeville. Esoteric ideas and new philosophies were hotly debated as people looked to create new futures in the face of new opportunities. Those who came during the Great Migration created a unique culture; a blend of the aspirations and beliefs rife with robust civic and nightlife. The Chicago Defender (where Bonnie works), is one of the leading black-owned papers and was instrumental in attracting people north. 1951: POINT OF TRANSITION Musician and poet Sun Ra was a resident of Bronzeville in the 1950's It's after WWII and the African American population in Chicago has nearly quadrupled, the Red Scare is in it's early years, housing segregation is being challenged (think A Raisin in the Sun) and the country is on the cusp of both a civil rights movement and cultural renaissance. The Regal Theater, Savoy Ballroom, and Club DeLisa were among the popular hang outs and Washington Park and the Southside Community Arts Center are hubs for the exchange of ideas. Chess and Vee-Jay Records were on the rise. Chicago's meat packing plant (where the characters meet) was at an all time high.

Over the years there have been a variety of dolls released but none have attempted to replicate the movements seen on screen. Earlier this year, Trick or Treat Studio's released a doll that is affordable and accurate to the movie. Only one problem... it didn't move. I made it a personal goal to turn this doll into a real-life animatronic doll. I started posting videos of my progress and I received a lot of interest from fans wanting to do the same for their dolls. I decided I would design something I could produce for other fans at a price range they could afford. I have spent almost a year coming up with a mechanism that can be quickly installed into the doll. Now I need your help. My budget won't allow me to purchase all the parts and dolls at one time so I am turning to you. Please back this project if you are interested in buying a kit or modded doll. I am making the goal low so that no matter what happens this project will be a success. I am proud to bring this to fans of the movie franchise and hope you enjoy having your very own animatronic Good Guy."

But we realize that you can find most of these films anywhere, so with our releases we are providing just a little bit more. If it's a silent film, then we're gonna include a new score. If it's a talky, we'll provide audio commentary. These movies will be given new special features. I mean how many copies of ""Carnival of Souls"" have you seen with special features? (And we're cheaper than Criterion Collection!) Plus with each DVD there will be an all-new exclusive short film from the folks at TPS Productions. And that's the real draw. We're not selling the public domain films, we're selling ourselves. The scores will be recorded by local musical acts. The shorts will be made by not only Daniel Richardson and Simon Terrell (directors of ""Unspeakable Acts""), but by new up-and-coming filmmakers who are just looking for a chance to shine. This is a side project that we feel truly passionate about. The money will go to put the first volume of the series on DVD. If it's a success then we hope to continue the series, putting out as many as 3-4 volumes a year!"

It started out nearly a year ago when our group of adventures needed a ship map for a TTRPG campaign. Two Beard Games took to the challenge and created a three-tiered ship that fit our table and campaign needs. It became the talk of the campaign and soon our youngest developer (11-years of age) got a hold of the ship and created a stand-alone game to play between campaign sessions. A few tweaks and adjustments later, and the Pirate�s Plundership is ready for the masses! - Model Kit - The Two Beard Games Pirate�s Plundership is delivered as a flat pack model kit made from environmentally sustainable Baltic Birch wood. The Pirate�s Plundership includes: A 3-tiered single-masted ship - complete with crow�s nest Dice Game figures Two cannons Functional Crate Anchor Dinghy A ship figurehead Customizable name plate Decorative box that doubles as the ship�s stand It�s easy to put together and is a blank canvas for those who love to work on models, paint figures, and stylize to fit any TTRPG campaign! When assembled, there are three decks ready for adventure! The ship model is approximately 17 inches long from bow to stern, 5.5 inches wide from port to starboard, and 12 inches tall from keel to the top of the crow's nest. -Tabletop RPG Ready- Two Beard Games Pirate�s Plundership was designed with TTRPG players in mind. Seafaring campaigns are always fun but finding a suitable ship can be tough. We made sure the grid for the board game matched scales with most popular TTRPG systems, added small features like the nameplate for customization, and kept each layer of the ship accessible from all sides. -Kraken Bundle- The Kraken bundle is for those who want to add a little danger to their waterborne campaign. The Kraken is a gargantuan creature base with multiple stand-alone tentacle figures so you can harass your players from each side of the ship! -Pirate�s Plundership Game- Race against your fellow pirates as you board and plunder treasure from your targeted ship. Prepare for battle as you go against the ship�s crew but be aware - the ship could sink at any moment! Pirates that make it back to the dinghy survive the attack. The winner is the one who collected the most gold. Simple Gameplay Roll the included dice to move around the ship and collect the coins you land on. Ending a turn next to an enemy token causes them to attack. It's risky, but enemies are worth their weight in gold, and that can make them worth fighting! Once three tokens with fire icons have been revealed, it's time to abandon ship! You have three rounds to make it back to the dinghy. Designed for 2 - 4 players, Ages 5+, 15-20 minutes per game."

You play as a contracted geologist who�s recently completed a survey for a global mining corporation and have returned to deliver the dire news of your research to the company�s CEO. The Last Survey asks players to make pivotal choices in order to steer the conversation toward progressive action, encouraging your employer to reconsider the ecological ramifications of depleting the earth�s minerals and metals. The game is divided into four chapters and is illustrated with hundreds of hand-drawn digital, graphite, and charcoal animations. Based on player choices the narrative, animations, and dynamic soundtrack composed by the duo Big Dog Little Dog will vary. But players must be cautious, for their choices might anger their employer and lead to a premature end to your compelling arguments. For this Kickstarter campaign, I want to bring The Last Survey into a cinema in New York and invite individuals new to experimental video games to play and engage with the game . This live play through will feature a voting platform for mobile devices, allowing audience members to actively participate in the main character�s decision making and dialog options. The Theater @ Kickstarter HQ With your help, I can bring this project to life, commission my collaborators, and hopefully perform the project at future locations across the United States. Come join us! Your contribution will directly support commissioning my collaborators, Big Dog Little Dog, to create a brand new score for The Last Survey. In addition to helping bring their brilliant compositions to the game, your contribution will also provide financial support to inviting them to perform live as I play The Last Survey at an event scheduled for June 26th, 2019. This event will serve as a culmination of my time as Creator-in-Residence at Kickstarter HQ, and will be held in their wonderful theater in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Your contributions will also help document the event with the collaborative team Intrinsic Grey Productions. Their work documenting, video-taping, and helping produce live performance events and contemporary art exhibitions is unparalleled. With their vision, documentation of performing The Last Survey will help bring the projects to new venues, festivals, and other opportunities. The Last Survey asks how the economic, political, and ecological decisions of a few affect the many. How do systems of power ignore the plight of society at large? By placing players in direct conversation with someone that could shape the health and safety of future generations, The Last Survey asks audiences what they would do this responsibility, and how they would go about deterring greed, corruption, and maintaining the status quo. In creating this work, I wanted to combine speculative fiction and interactive storytelling to interrogate bureaucratic systems of power. By bringing The Last Survey into a participatory setting, we�ll see how groups engage with tough decisions�and how interpersonal dynamics influence choice, engagement, and a sense of agency with games. What better way to start that dialog than to invite people to come together and play the game as a group? $15 � Early Access to The Last Survey. Get the full game before the official launch in Fall/Winter of 2019. The project will be available as a DRM-free download for Windows PC, MacOS, and Linux. $25 � Deluxe Edition of The Last Survey.

(Edition of 5) I�m Nicholas O�Brien, and I�ve been making and researching experimental media and moving-image art for over a decade. My recent focus on games and 3D animation comes from a background in avant-garde cinema, critical theory, and DIY-organizing-curating. Recent projects of mine include a 5-channel video installation about Green infrastructure in NYC at the Knockdown Center in Queens, and a video game project about the sudden closure of a public transportation system shown at LiMA Art Platform in Amsterdam. Though this project pulls together many strands of my research, it�s a big a return for me to more traditional theater settings. I came into my own as an experimental filmmaker while still living in Chicago, and am eager to return to my artistic roots. Big Dog Little Dog is the mild-melding duo project of violinist/composer Jessie Montgomery and bassist/songwriter Eleonore Oppenheim. Their music has been described many ways, but perhaps the most apt so far has been �post-minimalist groove americana.� The pair use an improvisational composition technique that draws on many genres and their experience as native New Yorkers to create lush, cinematic soundscapes that are by turns sweeping and achingly intimate. I�m personally really excited about this project because Kickstarter�s network of creators and backers would not only bring my project to new audiences, but also help connect some of the cross-disciplinary dots that I�ve been tracing in my recent work. So many of my personal favorite projects have started on Kickstarter and I�m continually inspired by community supported art practices."

If this campaign is successful, they will be remembered. Time will be spent researching these women and writing about their lives. A book will be published about their contributions to yoga. These women were yogis, strong women, circus performers, teachers and authors, yet they have been forgotten. If history had been written differently, they would be the ones we know and celebrate. It's time to remember them. Join me in telling their stories.

I've spent the last many years teaching yoga around the world, as well as writing, editing and publishing books about yoga from the Bengal region of India. Ghosh Yoga Practice Manuals I work closely with Ghosh's Yoga College of Kolkata and help bring people from all over the world to India. These people have included yoga teachers, yoga enthusiasts, studio owners and members of my very own family. Several years ago, Scott Lamps, Jerome Armstrong and I started working on editing and publishing works from this yoga lineage. These included the lost manuscript of Buddha Bose from the 1930s and an out of print German book by Dr. Gouri Shankar Mukerji from the 1960s. All of us have become connected with the region, so much so that Jerome Armstrong researched and wrote Calcutta Yoga (recently picked up by MacMillan Publishing), which details the lives of Bishnu Ghosh, Buddha Bose and Paramahansa Yogananda. While editing this book, the idea was born... what about the stories of the women?! During a preliminary research trip in April 2019, I realized the scope of this project. It's big. There were so many important women, whose work and dedication furthered the progress of yoga. Jerome, Scott & Ida at Jerome's Book Release Party -- October 2018, Oxford Books, Kolkata"

The fact that you are here is certainly not a coincidence and you probably want to learn more about the great End-Permian extinction, a subject that has been unexplored, mystical and terrifying. At last, the time has come to face this mystery we still know so little about. Hopefully, this game will bring the Permian age and its tragic ending closer to you, because the design process was preceded by a long study of the history 252 million years ago, so as to most accurately portray the subject and terminology. Consider participation in this program a game in which you will be called a volunteer or a researcher. The Polish version of the game has been funded, and it was a great success. Thanks to Polish backers your copies will include Special Animal miniatures, also all Add-ons unlocked in the Polish campaign are available to you from the beginning. Hopefully the Kickstarter campaign will be dynamic and with your support your copies of the game (as well as Polish backers' copies) will have even more additional content. The KS campaign is going to be very short, only 14 days, still we are hoping that all stretch goals will be unlocked. It is also important for you to be aware the game is already complete and tested, which is why there will very particular stretch goals in the campaign. Even if all of them get unlocked, we are not going to add any new, half-baked ones that could unhinge the game balance, ruining months of our work. Our goal is to release a well-tested and good-looking product, not a ton of poor, unplayable add-ons. We hope you understand that. Remember that together we have an impact on the final appearance of the game and its content. You are welcome to comment. Rulebook draft (before proofreading): PLEASE NOTE: All shipping within the EU/USA will be done by a courier service with a tracking option (UPS or other courier company). All others packages will be delivered using regular mail by a local postal service. In justified cases, other companies may be used depending on the current market situation. After the Kickstarter campaign is over, there will be a possibility to use a courier or a priority mail to any location with a surcharge (direct shipping to an individual recipient in the USA or any other country)."

The Story Analog Rainbow is a sci-fi/drama short film that tells the story of Vivian, a woman overrun by her own nostalgia. Vivian has a fraught relationship with her overly-bearing mother and an obsession with her past, until she is given a mysterious pill by the illusive Analog Rainbow Corporation that allows her to relive her most cherished childhood memories. Although her trip into her past begins well, the experience begins to sour as she rediscovers repressed memories, family chaos, and trauma, learning that her past isn't as simple as she remembers. The film will explore themes of nostalgia and family through the lens of a mother and daughter's relationship through the years. Director's Statement I've made three films so far and I'm proud of every single one of them. However as I set my sails to start work on Analog Rainbow I knew this film had to be different. This script and this story is one that's so profoundly dear to my heart and unlike anything I've ever written before. Nostalgia has played such an important role in my life both positively and negatively and I knew that I wanted to explore this dynamic when I began writing the script for Analog Rainbow. Very quickly into the writing process I realized something important. The basis of nostalgia is the exact same response that causes us to want to scroll endlessly through Instagram and Twitter rather than initiate conversations and facilitate relationships with those around us. It's fear. Fear that our lives won't play out the way we want them to and that we'll wake up one day and realize that we don't like the people we've become. Our past can be a safe place; our memories, both good and bad, can act as a cushion for this fear because they're predictable. We know how the story ends every time. It�s a circular thought pattern that can be comforting but once you find yourself stuck in that pattern it can become a debilitating and blinding tendency. This film is about realizing that life is about learning from and appreciating our past, but also finding beauty in our present. The beauty in the simple things in our day-to-day that we overlook so often like a hug from someone we love, an inside joke that makes you laugh until your stomach hurts, or just long rambling conversations with good friends about nothing and everything all at once. These are the moments that are happening now and I hope to remind people through this film that the past, no matter how sweet, can never replace the present.

Garrett is thrilled to be brought on as an editor for Analog Rainbow! Mood and Visual Style Telling a good story is undoubtedly the single most important part in the making of a good film, but strong visuals with emotional resonance is a close second. For this film we will be exploring some very unconventional and exciting visual styles with a bold and colorful color palette that will capture the vibrancy of childhood but will also complement the grounded nature of the film and the characters. Mood Board Here are a few visual references that help to paint a picture of the mood and look of Analog Rainbow. Mood Board Concept Art Here are a few artist renditions of specific moments in the script of Analog Rainbow and how we hope to translate them to screen.

Thanks to popular demand, we're preparing a new edition of the Justseeds Organizer datebook for 2020. And we're hoping you'll be part of the process! Radical artists help us visualize the social changes that we deeply desire. They give form to our dreams, our ideas, and our hopes. They remind us not just of the struggle, but of the inspiration that leads people to work hard for a common cause. People of conscience everywhere are joining together to resist the cruel and destructive policies being enacted against women, people of color, immigrants, reproductive freedom, gender diversity, and even the earth that we all share. We do not have the option of standing aside and watching it happen. The 2020 Organizer will feature the socially engaged art of the Justseeds Artists� Cooperative in a durable, colorful format with ample space for keeping track of meetings, upcoming demos, appointments, schedules and notes. As usual, we're putting out both a pocket edition (3.5"" x 5"", 160 pages, $15) and a planner edition (5""x8"", 112 pages, $18). The Justseeds Organizers are made with tough double-thick 130# covers and durable twin-loop wire, to withstand a year of vigorous use. This handy datebook also includes a moon phase calendar and a year-at-a-glance/month-at-a-glance calendars. Comp of the 2020 Organizer cover. (Art by Jess X. Snow) The 2020 Justseeds Organizer is the tenth one since the first edition in 2010. Regrettably, we couldn't print a 2019 edition of the Organizer because of funding problems. Eberhardt Press was thrown out of our shop by a developer, and our rent tripled, which blew our budget for the project. Production of the Organizers is a huge project (for us anyway), and the budget for materials, overhead and labor is quite substantial. We just couldn't swing it. But we got a really strong response from folx who shared our disappointment that we couldn't put out a 2019 edition. So, we started to mull over the possibility of a 2020 edition. There's certainly no shortage of excellent art from the cooperative, and we've published the Justseeds Organizer enough times to have streamlined the process. But we're a bunch of broke artists � where would the funding come from? That's where you come in. Want to reserve a copy? Pre-order, and we'll send a Justseeds Organizer fresh from the press. Your pre-orders will make or break this fundraiser. Or would you like to give the project a bump with a donation? You can get all sorts of cool stuff in return (see photos below). These donations help guarantee that we can fully fund the project. For the higher donation tiers, you can also get exclusive access to live broadcasts of the printing and bindery processes. You get to see us creating the Organizers as it happens. So, do you want to see a 2020 Justseeds Organizer come out? With your contribution, we can make it happen!

The author: Carol Diehl, artist and art critic, longtime contributor to Art in America and ARTnews. The publisher: The MIT Press of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. Kickstarter goals: The initial goal ($22,500) will cover Phases 1 and 2 of the project. Phase 1 will fund the writing of the second half of the book ($10,000), and Phase 2, the logistics and costs of acquiring photo permissions ($10,000+) and the required index ($2500). Anything beyond the initial goal will fund Phase 3: promotion: including a website, book tours and hopefully, hiring a publicist. Rewards: Book cost and publishing date are as yet unknown as well as final title and cover design. Aiming for late 2020. All reward books will be signed by the author. *** Why I�m writing this book: Street artist, vandal, political activist, and film director, the anonymous Banksy�s escapades are inevitably world news, yet he has not been acknowledged as the innovative and influential artist he is. While previous books have documented Banksy�s work with photographs, mine will be the first to deeply examine Banksy�s cultural significance. What sets Banksy apart from other street artists�or any artists�is that he�s a provocateur on a grand scale, a master at grasping the current political situation and mirroring it back succinctly and humorously, setting off waves of controversy that crosses international borders. Through his adept use of social media, Banksy connects with his fans as well as his adversaries, who often end up acting as his involuntary publicity agents�like Mayor Bloomberg, whose remarks about graffiti caused the New York Daily News to splash its front page with two words: �GET BANKSY!� The art world is always skeptical of artists who are overly popular with the public, especially those, like Banksy, whose work brings staggering sums at auction�and at first, I was one of them. However after frequent visits to England, where Banksy is considered something of a national treasure, and having my mind bent while watching his 2011 Academy Award-nominated film, �Exit Through the Gift Shop,� I began to suspect the public might have more insight into the elusive artist than the experts, whose reviews have been generally scornful and even uninformed. I determined to do the research my fellow art critics neglected, and the more I delved into Banksy�s seemingly flippant art and writings, the more substance I found�including philosophical underpinnings based in such diverse sources as Greek mythology and post-Holocaust political theory. The questions Banksy has raised over the last 20 years about the uses of public and private property, the role of the global �corporatocracy,� governmental incursions into privacy, the never-ending wars, and the gap between artworks as luxury goods and vehicles of social and individual expression, have become increasingly relevant, almost prescient. Yet while Banksy�s art is political, in the sense that it�s intended to inspire change, it is not bound to a particular ideology but exhibits a strong sense of inclusivity and humanism that crosses political and cultural boundaries. What�s inside: The book�s title, Banksy: Completed, was inspired by a painting Banksy did on the streets of New York, which depicted a dog peeing on a fire hydrant and a thought bubble floating from the hydrant that read, �You complete me.� In that way, Banksy�s pieces are like John Cage�s Happenings, which Cage said were intended to �catch a fish the nature of which we do not know� � the �fish� in this case, being the unpredictable events that unfold after the painting goes on the wall. Along with discussions of Banksy�s artistic origins and relevance, the book includes several chapters in the artist�s history starting with Banksy�s self-styled New York �residency� of 2013 where, every day for a month, he generated at least one public work somewhere in the five boroughs, turning the city into a giant scavenger hunt. Next, I look into the story precipitated by a single piece, Art Buff, Banksy�s unofficial entry in the 2014 Folkestone (U.K.) Triennial. Sited on a wall at the cross-section of greed and philanthropy, Art Buff caused a spin-off of intrigue, legal wrangling, gentrification, and art world commentary that continues today�with a surprise ending that shows that little in Banksy�s world happens by accident. Then I tour Banksy�s sprawling magnum opus, Dismaland where he fashioned a derelict amusement park in coastal England into a dystopian anti-Disneyland. Open for five weeks in 2015, Banksy�s 2.5 acre �family theme park unsuitable for children� was dedicated to the failure of capitalism, with concerts, film, miniature golf (or rather miniature �Gulf� with an appropriate oil spill), a whacked-out Cinderella�s castle, games that were impossible to win, a terrifying carousel, disgruntled park guides, vegetarian food stands, and an art gallery�in all featuring 10 of his works and that of 58 other artists from around the world. Dismaland drew150,000 visitors to the struggling town of Weston-super-Mare, boosting the local economy by �20 million. After it was over and Dismaland was broken down, Banksy went to Calais with lumber and a crew to build shelters for the refugees. Finally, I visit Banksy�s latest example of artistic activism, a fully functioning hotel in one of the world�s most conflicted areas. Touted as having �the worst view in the world,� it overlooks the West Bank barrier wall in Palestinian Bethlehem. Opened in 2017, the Walled Off (as opposed to Waldorf) Hotel features six guest rooms, a �Presidential Suite,� equipped with a hot tub, bar, and mini-theatre (�everything a corrupt head of state would need�), and a �Budget Barracks� dorm, outfitted with army surplus cots�all artist-designed and decorated. Facilities include a bookshop, a gallery devoted to Palestinian artists, and a museum that has become an ongoing repository for local stories, artifacts, and testimonies about the wall. Now regularly visited by tours coming to the holy sites, the Walled Off is fulfilling Banksy�s intention of attracting visitors to learn more about the conditions there, as well as bringing an economic revival to an area whose business was decimated by the building of the wall. Among the few house rules, �absolutely no fanaticism is allowed on the premises.� Why Kickstarter? Over the past four years my research has taken me from New York to England to the Middle East, funded through the generosity of friends who believe in this project. I�ve written the first half of the manuscript, and contracted with a distinguished publisher�The MIT Press�who will print and distribute the book to a general audience. Now that might make you think that the project is home free�that all I have to do is finish the book and be on to the next! However, authors today must take on many of the responsibilities and expenses publishing houses once covered. Except for a token monetary advance, I will see no income from the book until royalties are paid in June 2020. In fact, I�ve actually acquired costs. I must provide the index ($2500) and will be responsible for securing permissions for 70 photographs, which could cost $10,000 or more. I�ll need to cover minimal living expenses while I throw myself full time into writing the second half of the manuscript, and after that, will devote my time to promotion, including a website, blog, activity on social media, and travel for book talks. So, we know the book will be published. Now I just need to finish and promote it. That�s where you come in�to help complete the remaining phases and ensure that the book�s huge potential can be realized. This project is already a collaborative effort. Please join us and be among the first to see the finished book. Banksy: Completed can only be realized with your help.

I�m grateful to those who have contributed their talents and funding, beyond anything I could have imagined, to bring this book to life�starting with Christopher Sweet, who has worked tirelessly to connect the book with the perfect publisher; Alex Ross, an artist with an inspired literary eye who has helped me shape it; John Spiak at the Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana (CA), who gave me a place to work before I knew what the project was and arranged for the first lecture at CSU/Fullerton; former TIME Art Director Arthur Hochstein who designed the potential cover; the remarkable individuals who spontaneously offered to fund my trip to the Middle East; and others who have supported, in so many ways, the writing of the first half of the book.

What if I told you that the way to get over heartbreak is go to a meeting every day with a bunch of other people getting over the loves of their lives and talk about them for an hour and a half. You�d think I was insane. But that�s the boat we put our friends and family in who are struggling with addiction. 12-Step programs are the first thing most people encounter when they seek help with substance abuse. These programs say that the first step in overcoming an obstacle is to admit that you are powerless over that obstacle. This is false teaching. You are the most powerful person in the world over your own decisions. 12-Steps had me constantly looking backward, thinking about all of the crappy things I�d done in my life. Again, no other program tells a person that in order to progress they have to go back and fix all of the things they�ve done wrong. 12-Steps were created in 1935 at the height of the great depression and at the end of prohibition. Men all over the country were using alcohol as a means of escape from their harsh reality. 12-Steps were created in a time when people spanked their children and punishment was seen as a valid teaching method. We know that doesn�t work now and yet 85 years later we are still using the rotary phone of addiction recovery as our first line of defense. Whether 12-Steps or the rotary phone work today is irrelevant. If we can do better, we should. Our families and friends who are are seeking help deserve our best. When I finally HAD to overcome addiction, I threw away all of the crap I learned in 12-steps and started from scratch. I broke the problem down to its simplest form. I wasn�t doing what I should be doing. I realized that the only solution to this problem was to start doing what I should be doing. It hasn�t always been easy but it has stayed as simple as that. In my book Making Good Better, I outline the method I used to get back to living my life. I am now entering medical school and have my brain back. Addiction recovery deserves a new first impression built on action and hope. This is the cover art for the book. Making Good Better focuses on adding positives rather than removing negatives. It is empowering and improves quality of life from the first minute. It is forward looking. It is a proactive honest method for using relapse as a tool to get better. Above all it makes sustainable progression the key to increasing power and self-confidence. I am raising money finish my book, Making Good Better and prepare it for print. This book is very important to me. It tells the story of my journey of the past 10 years, from my first experience with substance use, to becoming a full blown addict, to finding my way back, and entering medical school. Heading to medical school. Please visit the website as well to get more information and preorder the book in various formats. https://www.makinggoodbetter.net/"

Tell the story of the people of The City as they fight, flirt, and steal time together amid a tense and escalating conflict. The witch Fyrestryke holds her wand, white-hot with Magic, pointed at the Auditor-Librarian. ""Why have you come here?"" Auditor Page looks down, embarrassed. ""After I saw your face, I... had to meet you."" The flash of Fyrestryke's magic dissipating hides the blush on her cheeks. Play as the Lords and Ladies, the fey noble families of the city, using the fey magic of promises, prophecies, and glamours; The Order, using the arcane techniques of ritual, patterns, and the careful and esoteric arrangement of mundane items; or The Witches, teaching The City to channel raw magic and weave powerful spells. a powerful and haughty Lord or Lady (with their loyal bug attendant) The Game The object of the game is to create messy entanglements. Fall in love with your enemies, ally with your rivals, fight with your friends. Players will create characters, establish their situations in solitaire scenes, and build scenes using the ten included games. Rules are lightweight and simple, and give you all the tools you need to establish and play scenes, even if improvising dialogue is not your strongest skill. Lady Thunderrose pushes the plate away from zinself. ""I didn't come here to be teased, witch."" ""Not a tease. A serious invitation."" ""You know I could never leave House Facade."" ""With some help, you could,"" the Witch smiles. Thunderrose whispers, zir eyes flashing, ""Only for you.""

Stealing Time Together - alone, together, with a gentle ""may I?"" Weaving a Spell - how do the two of us make magic greater than either alone? A Wizard's Battle - can you resist the full strength of my powers?

Scared by the Bell has been growing for the past two years from an idea to a webcomic to a print comic. You can stroll into a few comic book stores in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest to buy a copy, but why not get your own here on Kickstarter?! This comic is 100% completed, but what this comic needs is YOUR pledge to get her off the web and into your hands! Middle School is Full of Monsters. Scared by the Bell follows Peter�s first day at a new school� but this is NOT a normal school. Peter's classmates are gorgons, mummies, vampires... girls (all the scary stuff). Scared by the Bell is a story about ""accepting others despite their differences and a chance for high-jinks, but there�s also charming characters and an interesting setting underneath it all.""- The Daily Fandom In issue #4, Peter learns that some humans can be even scarier than monsters. If you're curious, read up on the story online over at Scared by the Bell. Peter's first look at the classroom (issue #1) Dylan Campbell is the writer, illustrator, colorist and letterer of Scared by the Bell. He grew up on Spider-Man, Calvin and Hobbes, and Uncle Scrooge comics. When he's not drawing comics, he's working his way through grad school and spending too much money at his local comic shop.

At the young age of 50. Yikes!!! Luckily, two months before this information I had gone back to school to get a programming degree. The good news was that layoff wasn't going to happen until December of 2016. I thought had time to get my ducks in a row. After the layoff in March, I was completely freaking out because now I was 52 and unemployed. I was still in school and wouldn't have my degree until December. With all these younger techs looking for jobs, I was not feeling very positive about my chances of finding gainful employment back in the tech field. I kept trying to figure out an app to make or something creative I could come up with to make some money. Then I watched the movie Snowden and it scared the crap out of me!! I had dreams that night of being watched through my PC camera. During those days, I was sitting at my PC for 12+ hours a day programming and had no idea how vulnerable I was. My dream also came up with a solution, The Shudder. I woke up that morning and told my roommate about it. I thought of the name and slogan instantly: The Shudder and ""It's Time To Shudder Up"". The name is a play on the word shudder...the device is used like a camera shutter, but it also makes you shudder when you think of why you need to use it at all. The idea came to me instantly, but creating and patenting the idea, name and device took 2 years. I definitely didn't have money for a patent lawyer after losing my job. It took 2 years but I kept my invention quiet and saved up enough money for a patent lawyer. The Shudder is trademarked with patent pending and has been for almost 2 months. Now I desperately need money to produce, market, and sell The Shudder and that is why I am asking for your funding. Production won't be super expensive, but I need to get a decent inventory together to have lots of choices to offer customers pre-made. Marketing the device, creating and maintaining an online store will be where the greatest expense comes in to play. I have never had my own business and will definitely need an accountant to guide me through finances and taxes. I hope you share my vision and will help everyone feel more secure while using their end devices and support my project. Thank you."

I am going into my senior year and the time has come for me to be more stressed and sleep deprived than the past three years, combined. It is time for me to create my senior film. Over the next year I will be putting in hundreds of hours of work, sitting through harsh critique sessions, and wanting to throw in the towel, all to create a short film that proves I am worth a piece of paper and a handshake. I know, I know, you're probably thinking ""Nick, hundreds of hours worth of work? Is it even worth it? Why don't you just create some stereotypical Rom-Com in a coffee shop and call it a day?"". Well I'm glad you asked. What I am trying to make will be more difficult than anything I have done before. My love for film, visual storytelling, and sharing stories with the world, is only a small part of what is required to take my idea from the page to the screen. Film isn't just about pointing the camera at someone and pressing record. It's not about creating something within your comfort zone just to avoid failure. Film is about stretching the boundaries. Not just in terms of the stories you tell but also stretching the boundaries of your abilities. With this project I am stepping out of my comfort zone. I am not trying to prove something but rather, I am trying to finally accomplish what I dreamed about as a child: creating something that pushes people to be more than they every thought they could be. As a child I remember being enamored with stories of heroes risking it all for something they believed in. As I grew up I knew that I have the same desire to influence people through film the way I was influenced growing up. Real life is never going to be like the movies so why not make movies? So please,""Join me and together we can rule the galax-"" wait... Wrong movie... All right everyone back to one. Lets try this again. THE STORY Set in 1917, A young draftee is sent to the front line, taking part in a large scale assault that ends in disaster, leaving him blinded by gas and the only survivor. Hopeless, scared, and wanting nothing more than to return home, he throws down his weapons, ready to surrender. To his luck, an allied scout stumbles across the young soldier as he flees the German line. Although having just met, the scout makes it his mission to instill hope into the blinded soldier and bring him safely back to their lines; no matter the cost. Of course, this act is easier said than done. THE PROJECT I was always a ""go big or go home"" type of person and that trait hasn't gotten any better with time. This project stretches the boundaries of everything done before for a senior film. What this means is that without the help and dedication of fellow classmates, friends, teachers, family, and all of you, this project wont be able to be created. I am planning on starting production in July and using entire school year for post production. The most challenging part of this project is going to be creating the set from scratch as well as building a world around the story that is historically accurate and believable. THE TRAILER The video above is a concept trailer I created to help visualize the film. Now, what makes this trailer stand out is that originally, It was a project for one of my classes. In my directing class we had to create a short film without sound and dialog. I was planning on shooting a completely different story but my professor pushed me to take my WW1 idea and put it on the screen. If I'm being completely honest I was against the idea because of fear and lack of self confidence ""How am I going to make my backyard look like WW1?!"". But with hard work, dedication, and a fantastic team, we were able to create a no budget WW1 short film. On top of that, It was filmed in one night, in my backyard, on a set I built myself, costumed by a friend and myself, crewed by my friends and classmates, shot on my own equipment, and made on a ZERO dollar budget. Its not perfect or 100% accurate (Yet) but it still communicates the idea of the film. I say this not to brag but to prove that with your generous donations we will truly be able to create something that can go on to be incredibly influential.

A project of this scale is dependent on a budget and sadly, if the goal is not met I will not be able to create the film at this time. LEGAL INFO The trailer music was licensed through Audiomachine.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Join us in celebrating and fundraising for Huneebee Project and our extraordinary youth beekeepers in residence! Huneebee Project provides job-skill building within a therapeutic context, as well as active honey bee hives and pollinator-friendly green spaces to vacant lots and gardens in New Haven, Connecticut. All proceeds directly support program development and employment opportunities for youth with foster care or child protective involvement. Our beekeepers in residence are youth ages 15-23 from New Haven county with diverse interests and identities and backgrounds. They contribute to the installation and maintenance of honey bee colonies as well as the planting of pollinator-friendly green spaces. At the same time, clinical social workers and mentors support our youth beekeepers in identifying transferrable job skills, resume development, and building body and emotional awareness through mindfulness practices. To date, we have graduated our first cohort of 5 youth beekeepers in residence, employed 3 as peer instructors and garden site managers, and inaugurated a second cohort of 5 youth beekeepers in residence! This could NOT be possible without YOU and everyone who has shown up to be a champion for our youth, under-resourced communities, and honeybee friends. We need YOU - your encouragement, support, and bee-lief - to help us make our launch in July 2019 official in becoming a self-sustaining social enterprise. We want to show that we can all serve together and prove to this world that WE ALL can in fact power and drive SO MUCH GOOD. Our beekeepers in residence are fierce and courageous and funny. Artistic and handy and gentle. Talented and determined and ready to share it all with our communities! What's next for Huneebee Project? In time, income generated through our online retail shop and community market places will fund programming, employment of peer instructors and graduates, and beekeepers in residence stipends. Our online retail shop will offer locally harvested honey from the colonies we maintain (through sustainable and natural beekeeping methods), candles constructed from beeswax harvested from the extra honey frame cappings, gardening tools and supplies, and local vases and pottery. For more on who we are and what we do: Huneebee Project involves youth between the ages of 15-23 with foster care involvement, child protective involvement, and/or developmental trauma histories in 4-month-long therapeutic Beekeepers in Residence job-skills training programs. The Project partners with the New Haven Land Trust and adds honey bee hives and pollinator friendly green spaces to community gardens or vacant lots in under-resourced neighborhoods in New Haven, Connecticut. At each garden site or vacant lot, participants experience workshops on sustainable beekeeping practices. Youth beekeepers in residence build, paint, and install honey bee hives, monitor food levels, and address issues of pest control using natural methods. Each participant graduates the program with an increased capacity for relationship building, increased sense of self efficacy and empowerment, an understanding of the role of the honey bee in nature and the many benefits of pollinators, and a completed resume. In addition to the opportunities made available to program participants, communities in which the gardens or lots live are invited to take part in various seminars and workshops hosted at the garden sites. Some examples of offered seminars and workshops include: beekeeping demonstrations, honey tasting, building bee hotels for wild & solitary bees, and talks on medicinal, pollinator-friendly plants and herbs. In addition to empowering and supporting our youth, Huneebee Project seeks to foster community building, collaboration, and kinship. Our vision: We envision a world that leverages the power of relationships and self-worth to increase resiliency and healthy human development. We believe there is no better way to do this than a social enterprise that facilitates kinship, mutuality with nature, mentorship, future oriented conversations, and development of valuable, soft skills. We want to increase collaboration amongst community members in achieving shared goals and visions for our youth, and to do so in a way that supports our environment, nature, and the bees. There are no ""beneficiaries"": we all serve together and we all benefit together. The team: Huneebee Project is led by a team of 3 beekeepers, 1 photographer, 2 peer instructors, and 4 clinical social workers. The project collaborates with multiple community partners, including the Yale Child Study Center, New Haven Land Trust, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, and Community Placemaking Engagement Network. Our volunteers and partners have experience addressing mental health needs of children and young adults, promoting social justice, and promoting sustainable, natural beekeeping practices and education on pollination to address the declining population of honey bees. Additional opportunities for program graduates: We hire Beekeepers in Residence graduates to fill a multitude of integral roles, including garden site managers and peer instructors! Employed graduates continue to receive supportive, on the job training, contribute to programming decision making, participate in community bee panels and awareness raising initiatives, harvest honey, craft beeswax products, and contribute to a welcoming, safe space for new participants. *Please, join us, support us, grow with us, and bee-come a part of our huneebee family!*"

(GEEK speak... if you don't want to read a bunch of tech stuff, scroll on down.) So I'm an engineer and I decided enough is enough. If I was ever going to have my Dream Torch, I was going to have to design it and build it myself, so I started with a list of design criteria. So it had to: have a built in spark igniter, for safety and convenience. CHECK! be really hot to get the charcoal going super fast, 400,000+ BTU. CHECK! be more efficient than other high power torches. CHECK! run on small portable propane bottles for portability. CHECK! attach to economical 20lb propane tanks for stationary use. CHECK! completely consume its fuel and produce an entirely blue flame. CHECK! be made of high-quality materials and last a long time. CHECK! be easy and intuitive to operate. CHECK! be able to be used safely. CHECK! (See ""Safety"" section below) be fun and able to be used spontaneously when friends dropped by. CHECK! look really cool, so that friends would see it and want one too. CHECK! This was a tall order, but the resulting GrillGun hits every one of these marks. Consequently is the only torch of its kind. Nothing else out there has all these design elements. It's an amazing tool that you'll want on your birthday list, Father's Day list, Graduation list, Christmas list.. It's truly a ""Best in Class"" torch. Watch me light the grill, cook hamburgers and put out the charcoal in under 8 minutes. It's worth it just to hear it roar and see it in action and in real time.

Fun, Time, Taste, Health and Happiness Oh Happy Day Fun - It's hard to describe how fun it is to operate a GrillGun and use it to start all types of fires. It is lightweight, comfortable to hold and easy to use, plus it looks and sounds like a jet airplane. Time - Now you can wait for your friends to arrive before you start the grill, because whenever you want dinner, you just start the grill and your cooking in minutes instead of half an hour or more. Taste and Health - The output from the GrillGun is fully consumed propane gas, in other words, pure fire, pure heat, no hydrocarbon contamination from any petrochemicals poured onto your charcoal or emitted from your gas grill burners. This makes for the best tasting, most healthy, most beneficial hardwood charcoal grilling available. Happiness - Happiness comes from true friendships. The GrillGun facilitates friendships on a multitude of levels -- visiting with friends on the porch while the grill is sizzling and the kids are playing, camping at the lake with your children and grand-children, tailgating with college friends before the big game, the romantic dinner for two under the moon-lit night sky, it just makes you feel good. No more... We've collected numerous Google reviews and video testimonials. We've shown it to strangers, friends, and family. asking them all to give us online reviews. You can find all of them or at GrillBlazer.com, some of which I've linked to this campaign for your enjoyment, as they tell you what people think, directly from their hearts... Happy watching! The GrillGun is a very powerful torch. For safe operation, follow these simple rules: The Grill Gun can potentially burn anything up to 5 feet from its fire bell (flame end) when it is lit and fully operating. Always be responsible to allow plenty of space around you and the GrillGun when using it. Always use the GrillGun outdoors in a well-ventilated area. The Su-V Gun can be used indoors, but with careful attention to ensuring the gas is shut off completely when not in use searing meat, and that you're not using it on or near any flammable surfaces. The fire bell will get very hot within moments of use. Allow plenty of time for the fire bell to cool down before touching it or laying it down on a melt-able or flammable surface. The GrillGun is sold with a stand and a hanging ring so it can either be stood up or hung in an upright position to cool. If children are present when the GrillGun is cooling after use, disconnect the propane and hang the GrillGun out of reach to prevent accidental burns or mishandling by the curious. Always teach someone how to properly operate a GrillGun before allowing them to handle it. Only allow someone to use it, if they respect its power and will operate it safely. As with any powerful tool, keep the GrillGun and its propane bottles safely stored out of reach of children and other untrained, unwise people. When the GrillGun is not in use, it is always safest to separate the GrillGun from the propane.

You want to get more done and crush your goals, it makes you feel more accomplished, right? It can be hard though, sometimes very hard. You try things and they don't work. You spend good money on planners you hardly use because they aren't helpful. Sound about right? Not only that, most planners are not built specifically to make you more successful. Most are built as a reflection tool. That's what I experienced, and I got tired of it. The BOSS Personal Planner Compact version features a high quality printed hardcover.

Being productive is hard. Broken down into sections so you can plan each phase of your life. This makes it very easy to stay organized. *Note, spiral ring will differ from pictures. See pictures below with single ring spiral. I struggled to be efficient and productive. Sure, when you looked day-to-day I was doing a lot, but it didn't get me close to my goals fast enough. I looked for a solution and while other planners helped, they didn't solve the problem. I started using my own note sheets setup as a planner. I created a big picture view and figured out what I wanted to accomplish in the long term. Then I broke it down further and created a road map to get there. After using my system for a few weeks I noticed I was making awesome progress for once. I was actually getting closer to my goals faster than ever. When you think about it, why hasn't anyone made a planner like this before? They all claim to be a ""system"" but when you use them, they really aren't. BOSS Personal Planner Compact in use. *Note, spiral ring will differ from pictures. See pictures below with single ring spiral. Let's take a look at some of the benefits that makes it so great. 1 notebook for everything - No need for a planner & notebook. This planner has extra room for notes every day. Get focused - Set clear goals every day that align with the bigger picture you planned. Declutter - write things down and empty your mind. Stay positive - Daily affirmation to get you going.

Manage your time - Set goals and tasks that you can fit into your schedule. 10,000ft view - If you don't plan long term goals, you're just going to spin your wheels and ultimately get nowhere. The first step is to plan the big picture. Challenge yourself - Set goals that will push you harder, back them up with nice rewards to add motivation.

BOSS Personal Planner stretch goal cover designs Most of the money will be going to fulfilling orders and acquiring inventory. I have already used my own money up to this point to get samples tested, build prototypes and start marketing. I've bootstrapped what I can and funded everything on my own with my personal savings. I have some of the money for the initial order but I'm looking to raise the rest. Some of the money will be put into the website and support structure. I've completely designed the website and everything on my own so far. Also, I want to add better customer support channels to better serve all customers. If the campaign receives enough pledges, I will use some of the money to add more designs and color options. Currently, both versions will be offered in 1 variation. You can see the stretch goals above. BOSS Personal Planner Compact versions with box BOSS Personal Planner box BOSS Personal Planner family The design and build process has been long and challenging. I have created dozens of page variations with constant edits. My goal was to create a personal planner that was fully usable. I was tired of planners I spent a lot of money on only to use bits and pieces or need another notebook with it. I also wanted the planner to make sense. It is a 3 month planner that is used as a system. It's not just paper to write things down. It makes planning and executing goals easier. Figuring out the 10,000 foot view helps you put together a 10x better ground plan. Better planning = getting more done. To figure out your small, daily, goals, you have to have your long term goals and plan figured out. This might change but if you just figure out small goals, you'll find time passes and you didn't really make a lot of progress.

I've spent a lot of time planning this out and getting everything in order so I can fulfill pledges and orders asap. I will quickly send out surveys and hopefully everyone is able to get them back pretty quick. Then I will put the order in with the manufacturer right away. From then, based on what I have talked about with my manufacturer, it will take about 6 to 8 weeks for me to get the first bulk order of planners (includes print and shipping time). Unless I have overwhelming success and tens of thousands of backers, I will be able to ship all planners within a couple of weeks. If I have to, I will hire some helps as well depending on the number of backers I receive. This is my full time gig right now so I can spend 14+ hours a day packing and shipping. Once shipped, US orders should only take a few days to a week for you to receive. You'll get a tracking number as soon as it is shipped. Shipping has been a huge mountain to climb. Shipping prices have seemed to get quite expensive over the years. Being based out of San Antonio, TX, I wanted to make sure I covered shipping around the world. I estimate it will cost about $8 to ship within the US via flat rate priority mail for the small planner. The larger planners will be about $11 on average. For domestic US backers, there will be no need for any additional charge for shipping, it's fully covered in the reward price. For international backers, the shipping price has been subsidized and you will only be charged the additional amount. I've estimated it best I could for different regions of the world. I hope you understand the reasoning behind the shipping charge. ***A little note for all international backers I do not want to charge you an arm and a leg to ship this, I really don't and it bothers me that for this Kickstarter I have to charge the prices that I do. I promise you, I did a lot of homework to find the cheapest rates and at this point, this is the best I can do. It is my goal to partner with a great 3rd party logistics company in the future so I can better serve you and get you an appropriate shipping rate. So, I hope you understand this and still want to back the BOSS Personal Planner. Thank you. If you'd like to get a FREE copy of the BOSS Personal Planner PDF and cannot financially contribute, all you have to do is share the Kickstarter project with your friends and email me a screenshot at support@bosspersonalplanner.com and I will add you to the list of people to receive the PDF version.

We want to create the best possible product for our fans, ourselves, and our future, and that requires high-quality studio time, mixing and mastering, merchandise, and promotion. Not to mention loads of time, practice, and dedication! All of these things are within our grasp and we are certainly putting forth the time, practice, and dedication. With the help of your contributions everything else will come! Upon the release of this album we will also be heading out on tour, so you can also help keep gas in the tour van and get us to our shows :) We are a band dedicated to making authentic music and this album and tour will represent a genuine artistic expression, a truly valuable thing, and we are elated to be able to share it with you. We also feel that his project stands as an accomplishment for musicians with disability, as these recordings stand as a triumph over Muscular Dystrophy, a disease that Joshua battles and overcomes on a daily basis. It shows our ability as humans to persevere over adversity, take something constructive from awful situations, and create something beautiful.

The Reeves Brothers are back with their latest album ""The Last Honky-Tonk""! Hi friends and fans, over the course of the past three years we've had a wild ride. We've done over 600 live shows, won Ameripolitan ""Honky-Tonk Group Of The Year"", Arkansas Country Music Awards' ""Vocal Group Of The Year"", and have recorded three albums (two of which you've heard). We've always found a way to fund our projects. This is the first time, we're asking you, the fans, for help. We believe in this album, more than anything we've ever recorded, and need help with funding to get it pressed and promoted. Be sure to check out the rewards section to see what we have to offer you for your contribution. New Album on CD New Album on Vinyl T-Shirts Trucker Hats Leather Belt Buckle Live Shows And more!!! Accepting The ACMA ""Vocal Group Of The Year"" After our win at The Ameripolitan Awards, we met a gentleman named Kevin Skrla. Kevin was good friends with Celine Lee and Dale Watson, and after crossing paths with him multiple times, on the road, he called and asked if we'd like to record a couple songs at his studio ""Wolfe Island"", in Dayton,TX. We didn't know that he owned a studio, and when we pulled in, it was a dream come true! Wolfe Island Recording Co. The Studio Kevin had took his favorite things about ""Sun Records"", ""RCA Studio B"", and ""Stax"" and merged them to build Wolfe Island. With our heroes cutting a ton of their hits, at these places, Wolfe Island was the perfect place for us. This was the first time we got to eat, sleep, and live at a studio week after week. Writing material there, and getting to piece it together like they'd do in the old days! Not being rushed, and being able to cut into the early hours of the morning. After we had laid all the tracks down, Kevin called up a friend of his named Bubba. Bubba is the owner of legendary SugarHill Recording Studio. This is the very studio George Jones had recorded the original version of Why Baby, Why, Freddy Fender recorded every hit he ever had there, and the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace was sung on tape inside this historic building. Kevin got Bubba to let us come down and record all of our vocals there, on the same gear so many of our heroes had performed on. Laying Vocals At Sugarhill Studios The Material If you're familiar with our group, you know we have a lot of 70's influence. For this album we wanted to dive deeper into the music we love. Although the album is packed full of 70's style country, we also drew inspiration from the 60's Merle Haggard albums, and the early 80's tracks of Alabama. We wrote 9 out of the 12 songs on the record, and the other three tunes were written by friends ours Shawn Ohler, Gene Price, and Ray Willis. ""The Last Honky-Tonk"" is a journey through the Honky-Tonk Country Music we grew up listening to, and love! Where Does All The Money Go This is our third album, so we're very aware of the financing it takes to release an album. Right now, we have 450 hours of studio time involved, and 8 trips from Vegas to Houston, that we've personally covered the expenses for. We've been planning for months all the places the money will go to. Here's a list of expenses. Mastering $3,500 Artwork $1,000 Vinyl Pressing $2,500 CD Manufacturing $1,450 Radio Promo Campaign $3,200 Publicist $10,000 Grand Total: $21,650 The Musicians We were so fortunate to have an incredible group of musicians that played on this album. Kevin Skrla We'll start with Kevin Skrla... Not only did Kevin produce this album, he drummed on different tracks, played guitar, piano, pedal steel, organ, bass, and several other things. He also makes the best coffee, this side of the Mason Dixon Line. Kelly Bishop Kelly Bishop has been with our group from the very beginning. He has his roots in Gospel, but loved raising hell! He grew up on a Silver Eagle, as a kid before leaving the South, to come out West! Kelly's laying down the majority of bass parts, you'll hear, on this album. Caleb Melo Caleb Melo is a multi-talented musician. Coming from Porterville, CA, he grew up listening to the Country Music sounds that made Southern California famous! Primarily playing the pedal steel guitar, on this album... he also plays guitar, dobro, and sings some background vocals. Eugene Moles Eugene Moles has been playing guitar since he started walking. Guitarist for Merle Haggard, Hee Haw, Rose Maddox, Hank Thompson, Del Reeves, and The Grand Ole' Opry! Eugene's guitar playing is featured on No. 7 Blues. Norm Hamlet Norm Hamlet played for Merle Haggard from the 1960's until Haggard passed away. We were very honored to have him lay some pedal steel down on this album. Mario Carboni Our friend, Mario Carboni called us up one night, while we were in the studio. He had heard a song we were recording ""It Gets Cold At Night In California"", and wanted to lay down a piano track for it. We were so honored as Mario is one of the greatest Honky-Tonk Piano players in America, right now!

The story of the first book follows a fourteen-year-old girl named Calista as she becomes curious of the dreams, magic, and creativity that's outlawed in her corrupt society (The Regime) and punishable by death. When she meets an artist named Wes, she gives art a try, loves it, and is then forced to keep it a secret from her father-- Head Executioner of The Regime. It's a story of emotional growth which then explodes into an adventure-like series that focuses on a group of teens, rather than just Calista, several of which have magical abilities as well as artistic views. I first published the novel in high school to raise money for my high school's arts departments. It was on a rushed time table my senior year, and now, I'm finding a lot of errors and problems within it. I was pretty young (17) to the self publishing industry then, and rather than taking down the book, I want to make it better for more people to get to read it.If this gets funded, I intend to revise Breaking Order to have multiple POVs and hire an editor for it to help the story really shine. I also intend to publish it in a variety of formats, including hardcover, ebook, and paperback. If I overpass my goal, I'd love to get a map or maybe some more exclusive artwork to be included in book as I love supporting artists with my work. I want my stories to be out there so I can express myself and share stories with teens that might be going through a rough patch right now. Maybe they don't know what they want to do, or maybe they have an artistic goal they love but people don't approve of. I want Breaking Order to encourage them to follow what they believe despite what some think and to break out and not be afraid to show their artistic shell. Thank you so much for the help you're providing for this. I appreciate it so much, and remember, Dare to Dream. - Catherine Kopf, 19-year-old author of the Breaking Order series."

The fits can be down-right frightening because they are unable to request their basic needs. I have been personally witnessing this every day for the past few years, as I am the father of a non-verbal child. That's where my communication app suite will come into play. I'm not going to pretend communication apps don't exist. They most certainly do. They are, however, quite costly. Most of them run on the concept that insurance companies and school districts will pay for them for the students, but, the problem with that is, not everyone is lucky enough to be in those school districts or have insurance plans that will supply their kids with the software and hardware. Most of these applications cost hundreds once you actually unlock all the functionality. My goal is to change all that. There is absolutely no reason why these applications cost that much other than pure greed. Trying to get rich off other peoples misfortune. My goal is to put an app suite on the market for all major mobile platforms as low priced as possible, so that any family who needs it can afford it. No worrying about if their deductible has been hit yet. No worry about if the school can supply them with it. The primary code is already in place, the only problem is, I lack the extra funds to buy the test platforms in order to begin work on the user interface. That's what this kick-starter is for, to buy as many tablets of various resolutions and sizes as I can, so that I can get this application up and running and get the first beta out. The application itself is a digital replacement of the widely successful PEC program, that has been used for ASD children for quite awhile. The PEC program is a series of cards with pictures on them placed in a binder. When the person needs something, they take the card out, and they give it to their care giver/parent/teacher. We're removing the cards and instead using buttons on a tablet with the phrases handled by text to speech, and images you save to the device can be mapped to each of the buttons. If we hit our goal, I will begin ordering the test platforms. If we exceed the goal, then I will put that money towards any further development costs beyond that. The test platforms themselves will be tablets of varying sizes and resolutions, so that we can have non-verbal children attempt to use the application and verify the user interface will be workable for them. This isn't something that can be done using emulators like most developers would do, this has to be done on physical hardware platforms. This code is backwards compatible all the way to android 2.3. https://www.facebook.com/The-Voice-of-Autism-1947572548869463/ is the Facebook page for the project. Please note: The video here is to prove the underlying code works. The user interface is on hold until test platforms are in hand so I can make sure a child with ASD will not have issues using it. The program can say any phrase you need it to, and you can use any image you place on your device. I personally advise taking pictures, so the user sees things they personally recognize. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message me directly. Thank you for your time! If we go above our targeted goal, I will use the money to buy additional tablets to donate to families with non verbal children with the software pre-configured."

The project began in 2010 as research exploring how to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI). The book Building Minds with Patterns provides the blueprint and a philosophy for building this particular kind of autonomous learning system. The book describes the architecture and motivation for the Piagetian Modeler. It was published in 2018 and is available on Amazon. The Piagetian Modeler prototype initially controls a single humanoid robot, and will be extended to scenarios where it controls multiple devices simultaneously. We need more hardware at this time in order to further this research, therefore your support is greatly appreciated. A new book, Coding Artificial Minds, (scheduled for publication in 2019) provides a detailed description of the implementation of the Piagetian Modeler using code snippets written in the Premise programming language. Premise is a high level programming language designed for creating intelligent systems. Two books on the language, The Premise Language, and The Premise Reference, were published in 2018 and are also available on Amazon. It is hoped that AGI systems will power the next generation of robots enabling missions in environments that would normally be hostile to humans, such as undersea exploration, undersea construction, space exploration, space construction, search and rescue, nuclear reactor repair, and so forth. Another potential benefit to building AGI systems is that the results may possibly provide insights and systems level models of how humans might actually work. The final objective of the Piagetian Modeler research is to produce a book, General Independent Learners, detailing the developmental progress of the cognitive system during its first year of operation and the behavioral milestones it achieves. A PDF of General Independent Learners, will be made available to all contributors to this campaign by December 2020. We are building the future together. Thank you for your participation. Michael S.

I am the Chef/Owner of G-Love. Opening G-Love has been my dream for as long as I can remember. My journey to becoming a chef started when I was 14 and I have never looked back. Cooking is the only job I have ever had, and it is the only thing I want to do. I am 32 now and over the last 18 years of my life I have been carefully planning what G-Love would look like, what it would feel like when you walk in the door, and what would be on the menu. G-Love is the culmination of my entire career spent cooking in restaurants. Or is it the start of my career? I�m not sure anymore! I am so grateful that I have been able to make it this far in launching my dream restaurant, but there are still a few final steps that I have to take before I can make my lifelong dream a reality! I sincerely hope that you will take a look at my humble little Kickstarter page here and maybe help a stranger to reach for the stars. G-Love is a revolutionary restaurant concept. I like to call it a �Reverse Steakhouse.� At G-Love, vegetables take center stage and make up the majority of the menu, while the proteins are served as �side dishes.� G-Love is the opposite of a traditional American steakhouse. Instead of choosing which cut of beef you want to order, at G-Love the choice will be �heirloom tomatoes or summer squash?� Instead of �ribeye or tenderloin?� it�s �romano beans or carrots?� At G-Love, when it comes time to order your side dishes the options are crispy pork belly, seared Alaskan salmon, or charred hanger steak, not creamed spinach, mashed potatoes or grilled asparagus like you would find at a traditional steakhouse. This format is beneficial in so many ways. It is better for the planet, it�s better for your wallet, it�s better for your health, and last but not least, it�s the way I like to cook and eat. Jay, Jordan and Juniper Uth, Olde Moon Farm Owners I have partnered with Olde Moon Farm, located an hour south of Portland, in picturesque Silverton, Oregon. Olde Moon Farm will be supplying G-Love with the freshest produce imaginable. Seasonal cooking is the cornerstone philosophy of G-Love. Restaurants all over the country have embraced the farm-to-table approach, but G-Love is unique in that we own our farm delivery van, and the cooks at G-Love will take turns working a 'Farm Shift' where they get out of the kitchen for a day and drive down to Olde Moon Farm to help with the harvesting and processing of the vegetables we will use at G-Love. After their farm shift, the cooks will drive that day's delivery back to the restaurant to be prepped for that night's dinner service. This format for the cooks' schedules at G-Love is extremely important to me. I have worked at too many restaurants over the course of my career where I felt that I didn't have a single moment to catch my breath. At the best restaurants in the country the cooks are expected to put their lives, health, and sanity on hold in pursuit of the Chef's Vision. This creates amazing food, undeniably, but at what cost? At G-Love we embrace empathy. We will give our guests amazing food, delicious drinks, and fantastic service, but we will not provide that experience at the expense of our most valuable asset, our employees. G-Love is all about that one crucial element that is so important in life. LOVE. We love our guests, we love our employees, and we definitely love our amazing produce! I hope to see you this summer at G-Love! Check out some cool articles about G-Love below! https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2019/3/19/san-francisco-veteran-garrett-benedict-to-open-g-love-with-vegetables-front-and-center https://pdx.eater.com/2019/3/21/18276015/g-love-garrett-benedict-reverse-steakhouse-portland Collin Nicholas The cocktail program at G-Love is something I am really proud of. The crucial element to our amazing cocktail selection is Collin Nicholas. Collin is a one-man wrecking ball of creativity. He has opened and operated bars in New York, Rome, San Francisco and Portland. He has over 11 years of experience in the industry and brings a young, fresh and eclectic perspective to the G-Love bar program. Originally from Berkeley, he grew up immersed in the strong and vibrant culture of the Bay Area. His work in the restaurant industry is focused on creating truly unique drinking experiences that challenge convention but also provide touchstones to classic cocktails. In keeping with that approach, his favorite cocktail is a classic gin and tonic! He is an indispensable part of the G-Love launch! Betty Benedict This is Betty. Without her, literally NONE of this would be possible. Betty is a force of nature, she is the most artistic, thoughtful, creative, caring, and selfless person I have ever met. Also, she is my wife. Betty is making the aprons that all the cooks and servers will wear at G-Love by hand. She is also making the bread baskets, the candle-holders, she is helping me with the interior design, she is the driving force behind all the DIY amazingness that is G-Love. Without her G-Love would not exist. Pledge for an apron, pledge for a bread basket, pledge for Betty! SPICED OREGON HAZELNUTS - $15 Man, I don�t even know how to put into words how delicious and addicting these Spiced Oregon Hazelnuts are! This is a technique that I learned from an extremely talented chef, Aaron London. I helped Aaron to open HIS dream restaurant about four years ago in San Francisco. He was very protective of this recipe and wouldn�t share it with me or let me make it until we had been open for about 8 months! At Aaron�s restaurant we used California grown almonds, but that wouldn�t make any sense here in Oregon, the land of the Filbert! (AKA hazelnuts) I have made these spiced hazelnuts my own by creating a custom spice blend that I will never share until the day I die. The only way to get these before opening day is to pony up and throw down with a generous pledge! I promise you won�t regret it. Market Tote (left) G-Love Apron (right) G-LOVE MARKET TOTE BAG - $20 How awesome is the G-Love logo, guys?! I have already broken in one of these badass branded totes at the farmers markets here in Portland and let me just say, this tote is a keeper. Functional and beautiful, it�s got it all! G-LOVE ENAMEL MUG - $25 This mug. If you only knew the trials and tribulations, the fire gauntlets that had to be traversed, the epic medieval fight scenes that had to be conquered in order to offer this mug to y'all. If you knew you would pledge for them all! Long story short, it was a little complicated to get these made, but they are here, on Kickstarter, patiently awaiting your clicks and pledges! Please give these mugs a good home, they really deserve it. Also, they hold coffee. Enamel Mug (left) Bread Basket (right) YOUR NAME FEATURED ON OUR WEBSITE - $30 www.g-lovepdx.com is our website. It�s gunna be really effing cool. I hate websites that are over complicated, so ours is super simple. A restaurant website should communicate only a few key details: Where is this restaurant? What is on the menu? What does the food look like? How do I make a reservation? That�s about it! So, if you want to be a part of the realest restaurant website out there then you should definitely ball out and pledge to have your name immortalized on ours. We promise we will make your name look super classy and of course, YOUR name will be bigger than all the other people that pick this pledge. (WINK) Natural Leather Coasters, $20 THE ULTIMATE SWAG PACKAGE - $85 SWAG. Let�s be honest, this is the heart of Kickstarter. For the true swag connoisseurs out there, there really isn�t any other choice than the Ultimate Swag Package, is there? If you�re down for the G-Love cause then pledge for this package and you will get the G-Love sticker, the spiced Oregon hazelnuts, the badass market tote bag, the enamel mug, and a hand-written thank you card from yours truly. I might even throw in a little hallelujah for your pledge! LET CHEF GARRETT COOK FOR YOU + A GUEST - $95 Do you love food more than anything? �Let Chef Garrett Cook For You + a Guest� is right up your alley. This is a tasting menu. Normally I would charge $60 per person for this, but if you pledge for it now, you�re saving $25! And believe this, for the people that come in to G-Love and say, �Hey, I pledged for the tasting menu on Kickstarter� I am going to throw down on your dinner! We�re talking Little Things, we�re talking Cold Goods, definitely some Hot Stuff, I am probably going to send you too much food. We are gunna have to wheel you outta the restaurant with a trolley. You want this. I will spoil you. Check out a sample menu below! G-Love Menu COOKING 101 � $101 I�ve been cooking my whole life, along the way I have picked up a few tricks.

COCKTAIL 101 � $101 If you love cocktails but never know how to make them at home this pledge is for you. Our bartenders will teach you whatever you have always wanted to know but have been too afraid to ask (about cocktails). CHEF FOR A DAY + DINNER FOR ONE - $250 Chef for a Day is one I am particularly excited about. Come in to work a day at G-Love and see what it really takes to make a top restaurant hum!

You will get a behind the scenes look at our kitchen and after you�ve put in your shift you get to sit down and enjoy a delicious meal that you had a part in preparing! PRIVATE COOKING CLASS WITH CHEF GARRETT - $1,500 This is really exciting. The cooking class happens on a day when the restaurant is closed. We can collaborate on what you would like to learn, or I can put the menu together and you and your friends can just enjoy the ride! Either way, we�re gunna have a blast and learn a lot. Also, I own the restaurant so we can crank the music and just live life to the fullest. But most importantly, we are going to eat some really, really delicious food!

Without Jay and Jordan, G-Love would not be possible. The work that Jay and Jordan put in every day ultimately ends up on the plates at G-Love. If you choose this pledge, you will get to meet them in person and bask in the glorious sunlight of the Silverton Hills. Picture this; frolicking on the farm, harvesting the freshest veggies, and maybe taking a stroll up to the hidden pond in the woods. I will personally guide you and three friends through all the amazing nooks and crannies of this amazing place. After the tour, drive back up to Portland for your dinner at G-Love. Sounds like a pretty good day to me! G-Love Construction Site EXPERT CONSULTING - $2,000 I have been working on launching G-Love for over 18 months now. There have been highs, lows, and times when I thought I was never going to make it work. In the end, perseverance was quite helpful but not as helpful as someone who has the EXPERIENCE of doing it. I will be your open book. I will coach, advise, and propel you towards the restaurant of your dreams that we both know you are going to make happen. You are going to will this restaurant into existence. You are going to build something from scratch. But everybody needs a leg up now and then. I have lived it. I�m living it right now. This is a serious amount to pledge but it will pay itself back in spades when you have the restaurant of your dreams! If you have gotten this far down the page, I salute you! Thank you so much for your generous pledges, it really means the world to me. I love that we live in a world where a complete stranger can have a real impact in helping someone else realize their dreams. But if you have pledged on the G-Love Kickstarter page we are no longer strangers! Make sure you come say hello to me at the pass next time you come in to eat, I can�t wait to meet you!"

In their adventure, they learn about themselves and the world around them...for better or worse. '32 Kick-Up is an action/comedy webcomic that's been running since 2016. The simplest way to describe it is a mix of Mickey Mouse, Scarface, and Dragonball. It follows the adventures of two short-sighted kids, the arrogant Patricia-Marie and her humble best friend Calloway. After Calloway's 2nd cousin and guardian is kidnapped by the crime boss, Mr. Tierney, the two find themselves fighting the mob through the guidance of Patty's idol, the street vigilante who goes under the moniker ""the Bridgeport Bruiser,"" real name Helvetia. The comic can be read for free on it's website. '32 Kick-Up Vol 1 is a 185 pg 5 x 7.5 inch paperback. It features chapters 1-8 of the comic, plus more than 20 pages of bonus content, which includes behind the scenes notes on my creative process, as well as sketchbook pages showing the evolution of the story and characters to their final state. The extras are intended to lay bare my creative process and attempt to demystify creativity in general. I want it to be more than just a curiosity and to encourage aspiring creators to work on their own projects and fight off those doubts and insecurities that everyone has to go through. Backers have multiple tiers to choose from. If this Kickstarter manages to exceed it's goal, there are a few stretch goals available. The books will be shipped using USPS. Shipping inside the US is relatively problem free, at a flat rate of $5. But for orders outside of the country (including Canada, to my surprise) the price for shipping jumps up to $30. I feel this needs to be spelled out clearly. Silly Rookie (Perry Renarldo Singletary Jr.) is a cartoonist from Springfield, MA.

Yet we find it painstakingly annoying and challenging to discover quality new music that is not produced by the mainstream. Our solution/Product: Nearly everyone will agree the single most effective way to discover a new song you like is to ask a friend/peer. PeerPlay operates with this belief in mind. We believe that this cooperative notion is what sets PeerPlay above other streaming services. Music discovery led by the people for the people, without the input from the labels. The product: The user will enter the genre/mood/attribute, or any adjective at all, of the type of music they want to discover. Similar to pandora's stations, the user would then hear a continuous stream of only songs that are of this genre/mood/attribute without interruption of ads. As the station plays tracks, the user would continuously be hearing/discovering new music as it is produced. The process: Communal music discovery: The genre/mood/attribute that the listener previously entered was for lack of a better word a ""bag"". ""bags"" are a collection of songs belonging to a single description, what every song in the bag shares. Think of bags as literally bags filled with songs, each bag is labeled by the types of songs it contains. Bags are how we filter songs. Every song is uploaded without any descriptions nor is it located in any bags except the recent uploads bag, the bag which every song is added to initially. The ""explore"" page might look something similar to the above; it shows songs as they are uploaded. Here people will listen to songs nobody has heard nor added to any bags. This page is geared at the true trailblazer, the trendsetters if you will.These songs are the newest of the new, however each one is unknown in every way. This is where cooperation is pivotal to the success of PeerPlay. These users will then begin tagging these songs with the names of the bags they believe best identify the songs. With each bag the song is tagged with, we will gain an accurate description of the song, created only by the users. The users who add songs to bags are assisting their neighbors who want to listen to songs of the bag they just interacted with. If everyone works together we all reap the benefits of bags with extensive catalogs. A sample of how users might add songs to bags is seen below. Teamwork makes the dream work. As the listeners listen, they will be able to tag the song with any adjective they feel best describes the song. For instance a person may feel that their current song sounds ""jazzy"". Once a song receives a tag it is added to the bag bearing its name in our example the song is added to the ""jazzy"" bag. If the bag does not exist it is created by the user. Now whenever a person is wanting to discover new ""jazzy"" songs they would search ""jazzy"" and be played a continuous stream of songs pulled from the ""jazzy"" bag. Much like reddit the users direct the service, they will create every bag and be the ones adding songs to bags. The communal opinion of the users will over time become a very accurate description of songs, facilitating the discovery process for everyone. Points: Users earn points for tagging songs and listening to recent uploads. Points can then be spent to boost artists or songs that users want to gain recognition. Every week the hot page will display the ranking of songs, bags, and artists that people have spent their points on. Yet another way to discover new songs, this will show what users believe is worth listening to. Considerations: Songs may be flagged if they do not fit the bag they are added to, given enough votes the song may be removed. Songs may also be flagged if they are not the original work of the artist and potentially removed. This service is entirely controlled by the users, they will dictate the accuracy as well as effectiveness of the platform. This platform is designed for underground/up-and-coming artists. People who create music with minimal financial backing but a quality sound nonetheless."

Michael Cooper (1941-1973) was a beloved British photographer best known for his photographs of leading rock musicians of the 1960s. Cooper began his successful career as a fashion photographer for British Vogue capturing the vibrant energy of the Swinging Sixties in London. In 1964, through the art dealer Robert Fraser, Cooper became immersed in the art and music scene and photographed many leading figures in music, art, fashion, and literature, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol, Cecil Beaton, Twiggy, Jean Genet, and Allen Ginsberg among many others. Cooper's close association with the Rolling Stones, resulted in his largest body of photographic work. As a trusted friend, Cooper was right there with them, camera in hand, capturing every moment, at home, at play, and in the studio. In 1967, Cooper photographed two of the most legendary rock and roll covers of all time, The Beatles� Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, and The Rolling Stones� Their Satanic Majesties Request. In 1973, Cooper took his own life leaving behind an unparalleled photographic legacy that is cared for by his son Adam. We are pleased to offer the first ever Brian Jones photo book to be published as a deluxe limited edition. Rolling Stones: Their Satanic Majesties Request & The Beatles: Sgt. Peppers album covers which are among Michael Cooper's best known photographic works. It has been 50 years since the death of Brian Jones (1942-1969). Jones, an English musician is best known as the founder and original leader of the Rolling Stones. To celebrate his life and work we have compiled a limited-edition book of rare photographs by Michael Cooper. In addition to the images, we invited some of Jones' closest friends to help tell his story, resulting in more than 10,000 words. Our contributor contributions include a foreword by music legend Donovan and new contributions from Linda Lawrence, Prince Stash Klossowski de Rola, Andee Nathanson, Jones' son Julian Leitch, his grandson Joolz Jones, Rolling Stones road manager Sam Cutler, and renowned music journalist Paul Trynka. Their stories told shed new light on one of rock and roll�s most enigmatic characters. This book was overseen by editor & art director Dagon James in collaboration with Michael Cooper's son Adam Cooper and his wife Silvia Cooper. Together they carefully examined Cooper's original 35mm film, bringing into sharp focus the brilliance of Brian Jones at work and at play, featuring moments in the recording studio with bandmates Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman alongside more intimate candid images. In addition to the selected photographs, we are pleased to include a never before published poem, written by Brian Jones to his partner Linda Lawrence shortly before he passed away.

It's a collection of 100+ pages like this: WHY DID I WRITE THIS BOOK? I woke up one morning in February like I do occasionally, already gripped by anxiety. Every muscle tense, my mind racing, a reader board running through my brain as one aggravating thought after another raced through. Like other mornings, by the time I got up I was fine. I quieted or captured the thoughts with God and then I got out of bed and went about my day. But unlike other mornings, the process of capturing and quieting was slowed down for me. Other mornings, caught in the grips of the anxiety monster, the process was a blur. I only knew that I took breaths and cried out to God and took more breaths and cried out more. This morning though, God shined a big light on the process. As He did, I felt Him saying, �This could help people. Write this down.� So over the next months, as the light continued to shine on the process, I wrote. What I have written so far is now part of a collection of meditations, prayers, and a few short letters to the reader, available as a free download on my website beginning May 15th www.stevieswift.com. What I want to do, what this project is about, is to double the collection and make it available as a printed book. In addition to more prayers and meditations, and I will add a collection of lamentations. WHY ARE WE PRINTING IT? As I wrote these things down, as much as I am grateful for a way to share these things for free in PDF form, I felt a strong desire to put a physical version out there into the world. Something people can hold and flip through and put in a purse or a desk drawer or on a nightstand. I think, as people read through the PDF version, many others will feel the same - I think enough of us will want a print version that we might be able to come together and actually get it done. In that spirit, I created this Kickstarter project as a vehicle for us to come together and get it done. HOW CAN I BE A PART OF THE PROJECT? You should see a section on this page with pledge amounts and a reward described for each pledge amount. Choose which reward you would love, click on it, and follow the instructions for check out. YOU WILL ONLY BE CHARGED IF THE PROJECT IS FUNDED. If we are funded, I will have the books printed and send out all rewards by the end of September (although I'm shooting for the end of July, I want to leave lots of room for any delays we might encounter.) This is my third printing project. I am familiar with the process and I have a great local printer I use. Below is a breakdown of the estimated costs and why I chose the goal amount of $1,102. 150 books printed = $689 (any less than 150 and the per book price is quite high) Estimated shipping and packing costs = $200 ISBN number = $125 Copyright registration = $35 Estimated minimum cost of additional rewards = $100 If you are doing the math, you'll see these add up to more than the $1,102 goal, and there is a reason for it. During this process there was a bit of scripture which gained, in my own heart, a much deeper meaning. It was James 1:2. $1,102 is in honor of how God worked in my own life as I worked on this book, how He pointed me to eternity, how He stripped me of ego, and how He is working in and through all things. ""Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds."" I'm trusting we will surpass the goal by this little bit and if not, I have a plan for that - you can scroll down to see it! Thank you so much for coming here and checking out this project. Please don't hesitate to ask me questions if you need any help making a pledge or if I failed to answer something in this section!"

For some time now I wanted to create Ghibli pins but couldn't think of how to make them special and stand out from the crowd. I came up with the idea to draw them as the 12 zodiac signs and everything coalesced from there. It didn't always run smoothly, I am a consummate professional when it comes to stall tactics, but I managed to put together a project that makes my weird, nerd heart happy. I hope you also feel mutual weird nerd love. I did my best to match up the characters with signs that suited them but please keep in mind that all signs have multiple facets to them just as people do. So not every trait will match, but not every person born under a sign fits it perfectly. I hope you can see something of yourself in your sign character. For the designs I wanted to include an element of the star sign within the pin but keep it subtle so that no matter when you were born, you could wear any pin. Some designs are more on the nose than others but I think even different star signs can enjoy any of the pins in this collection. These are more detailed and colorful than my other pins and with 12 of them on the lineup, it's a hefty undertaking that I could really use your help with. I want to be able to produce them all at one time instead of breaking up the pins into monthly installments. Scroll down through the page to see more details about the pins, myself and my company Printrovert. I opted for a campaign goal that would fund all 12 enamel pins as opposed to one that unlocks each sign at a time. I want to make sure that if this project is funded, everyone has access to all the signs to ensure maximum happiness. Every pin will measure at 1.75""/44.5 mm and come with 2 backing posts for the highest of security. They are all hard enamel pins and each one is gold plated except for Taurus/Sheeta who is silver plated and Leo/Calcifer who is rose gold plated. Early bird pricing is $8 per pin Kickstarter pricing is $10 per pin After the campaign ends, the retail price will be $12 By pledging you are helping my project of love, sweat and tears come to life AND are saving money. Dolla dolla bills y'all! Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding campaign so if I don't hit my target goal when the clock stops ticking, I won't receive any of your beautiful cheddar.

I really like alpacas, sloths, stingrays and otters (in no particular order). I enjoy: making blanket nests to read in, eating tacos, traveling, drinking tea (preferably jasmine green tea), collecting useless but cute things, making stupidly long playlists and light internet stalking my friends. I also enjoy learning German and singing but am good at neither of those things... My resolution for every year is to pet all the dogs. About Printrovert Printrovert is a small goods & print company founded by this ^ awkward girl who doesn't always like the company of other humans. Printrovert was created in 2015 when I was working as a graphic designer in Los Angeles as a way to escape the fact that seeing homeless men poop on the sidewalk was part of my reality. I'd eat lunch in my Pantone cubicle and come up with illustrations for puns or vice versa. The first products offered were 20 illustrated pun greeting cards that were funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign. Since then I've created art prints, temporary tattoos and enamel pins. Here are some samples of past pins I've produced:"

I was inspired to write the pilot in 2018. I wanted to create a story that would inspire and provoke discourse on the subject of borders and how every nation in the world is affected (one way or another) by backroom policies. These policies are often self-serving and hurt the very people they are created to protect. This is not an America/Mexico problem, this is a universal issue that affects us all. The series takes place on a fictitious continent shared by two diametrically opposed countries. The Hard Pass is the colloquial name for the forest that lines the national border. It separates the southern dystopian society in the south, from it's rich neighbor to the north. The Northern government creates mechanical beasts, programmed to kill anyone that attempts to cross through the forest into their nation. This patch of land becomes a graveyard of lost souls who attempt to migrate into the north. The people become desperate for hope until one woman takes action into her own hands. Tanji becomes the guide they have been praying for. She masters The Hard Pass and is the only one who can safely traverse people without casualty. She soon discovers that her fight is greater than the beasts in the forests and she has to decide if she's willing to risk it all in The Hard Pass."

Gain the Unholy Adversary�s favor and thwart your competition by unleashing terrible hexes on them or by giving them a good ol' fashioned �Beelze-Beatdown�. It's a no-holds-barred free-for-fall fight to be the first to light all 5 candles in your pentagram and usher in a thousand years of darkness! During setup, each player receives (1) pentagram board and (3) cards. The candle tokens are placed anywhere within reach of all players. That's it. Easy peasy. Come up with your own way to determine who goes first (we usually prefer the ol� first one to play a card method) then continue clockwise. Crazy Cultists is a fast-paced game, so don't worry if things get a little chaotic. It's all part of the fun. Players take turns either building favor with The Dark One by creating a Favor Stack, or sabotaging a rival cultist by playing Hijinx Cards. It's a play one/draw one game so planning ahead is key. But remember, the closer you are to victory, the bigger the target on your back becomes! Once a player reaches 10 or more points in their Favor Stack, they earn a candle token. Earn 5 candle tokens to win! Favor Cards are valued between 1-3 points and are used to create your Favor Stack. Favor Cards are stacked one on top of the other so that the corner number can still be seen. Once a player has reached 10+ Favor Points in his or her stack, the stack is discarded and that player earns a candle token. Hijinx Cards are used to sabotage another player�s favor with The Dark One. These cards can produce a wide variety of effects, but most commonly cause a player to discard the last 1, 2, or 3 cards played in his or her Favor Stack. The goal of Crazy Cultists is to be the first player to earn 5 candle tokens. Easier said than done, as the tide can turn at any time! Earn your candles as well as your rightful place at the side of The Dark One, himself! Table talk is not only allowed, it's HIGHLY encouraged. Feel free to let the rest of the table know the contents of your careless fellow cultist�s hand or alert everyone to just how close Little Susie McQuiet-Pants is to getting her next candle token! It�s all about being the cultist on top, so don�t be afraid to make a few enemies! At its core Crazy Cultists is a ""Take-That""/""Screw-Your-Neighbor"" card game that gets more intense and more fast-paced as the game goes on. Our goal was to create a game that mixes the best parts of a casual party game with tense strategy and non-stop action and we think we've done it! We are partnering with WinGo Games (https://wingo.games/) to handle the manufacturing of Crazy Cultists, but to make this all a reality, we need your help! And that's why we're here on Kickstarter. We can't wait for you to see our game and we hope you love it enough to make it a reality. Add-On Instructions: To add items to your pledge, manually add the $ amount to your base pledge.

What motivated me to create the original high-performance kingpin was because when I would grind on my trucks the kingpin would often get in the way and sometimes cause me to fall. Also the kingpin nut would become damaged from grinding and become difficult to adjust. I realized this out-dated design could be improved to meet the needs of the modern skateboarder especially when it came to grinding. I designed and made a prototype inverted kingpin which I tested that worked good. The invention was a �Grinding Kingpin� so I shortened the name to Grind King. Original Kingpin set from 1988 One of the first Grind King Ads Some pro riders such as Jay Adams really liked them so I knew I was on to something. I took the Grind King kingpins to the Action Sports Trade Show and got a bunch of orders. After a couple years of making and selling them I decided to design trucks that had the GK kingpins already in them. I kept making trucks and skate hardware till around 2009. After taking a 10 year break I have decided to bring Grind King back with an all new GK truck called the Disruptor. This truck is a refinement of all the years I have put into designing trucks and has the lowest kingpin in history for the smoothest grinds. It is my goal to provide you with the best grinding and highest performing trucks in the world. Your contribution means a lot and in return I intend to bring you more innovative skate products that I hope can help progress skateboarding. Grind On! Donald Cassel The GK Disruptor has the lowest kingpin in history for the smoothest grinds. The curved edge on the baseplate helps prevent board breakage. The Disruptor has unique features that give it an advantage in grinding and performance The 6-n-1 tool has all the tools you need for your skate yet fits comfortably in your pocket Grind King has created the ultimate skaters backpack with that is loaded with innovative features such as the removable satellite pack. The GK Backside 180 is the King of all skate backpacks! Super dope high quality GK zip hoodie Stylin logo T-shirt with silver ink FOR THOSE WHO GRIND! High quality hat has embroidery on two sides.

Wield cards to attack, defend, and even reflect your rival�s strikes. Call upon the power of supernatural kami to aid you in battle. Master the ways of the blade to dominate foes, honor the kami, and rise as shgun. Turn-Based Action�Wield cards to attack, defend, and even reflect your rival�s strikes in your quest to become the next shgun. Unique Kami Powers�Summon kami, supernatural beings or phenomena capable of tide-turning abilities and kamikaze attacks. Innovative Stance Mode�Outsmart your opponent by playing the right card in Stance Mode, an action that occurs when your rival takes a turn. Katana is a two-player only game with battles that last 15�35 minutes. The game is suitable for ages 10 and up. Gameplay is handled through cards. Each turn you use cards to take an action, respond to your opponent's attacks, and set a defensive stance. The ultimate goal is to eliminate your opponent's health to remain standing as shgun; however, brute force is only one approach to the game, as other strategic paths are available. What makes Katana unique is its intense, thought-provoking action. Distinct from the steel-clashing swordsmanship of medieval European knights, Japanese sword battles were surprisingly cerebral as samurai sized each other up and planned two, even three moves in advance of their opponent. The lethal nature of these encounters made samurai cautious, but effective warriors; one would think of any associated risks as well as the possible rewards that might derive from an action. Turn-based card battles correspond nicely to this, resulting in a test of wills between players eager to be the next shgun. Zephram joins Trevor and me for a game of Katana Battle�Use cards to inflict damage and defend. When taking a turn, you may attack by playing an offensive card. To defend, simply play a card with a defensive value and subtract it from the attack value to determine if the hit landed. Bonus attacks can boost your offensive capabilities, whereas the ability to reflect attacks provides an edge to defenders. Stance�After taking an action, you may play an action card face down. This is your defensive stance during your opponent's turn. When you opponent takes an action, you may reveal your stance card. However, if your opponent chooses not to attack, your stance will break and any benefit to be gained from it will be lost. Placing a card in Stance mode Kami�Divine beings and forces of nature called kami provide crucial support in battle. Every kami possesses two abilities: an active one that requires playing a purify card and a passive ability that is ""always on."" Not only do kami provide game-changing special powers, they can be called upon to sacrifice themselves in kamikaze attacks that inflict massive damage (crab bosses beware). Each time you activate a kami power, though, you must draw a shrine card. A mixture of good and bad events, shrine cards are yet another element of risk to think about when considering use of kami powers. Purification and pollution�Japanese warriors were deeply spiritual and believed in the ritual dynamics of purity and pollution. In order to activate kami powers, you must play a purify card. Beware, though, as your opponent can prevent you from accessing your kami's powers by playing pollution cards. Fortunately, pollution can be eliminated by countering with a purify card.

I believe in the potential for gameplay to communicate historical concepts and cultural memory in ways distinct from traditional forms of scholarly discourse; in other words, historical experiences and a sense of past cultures can be generated through meaningful play. My fascination with Japanese history led me to develop a game that does more than employ history as a setting, but actually evoke the tension, spirituality, and political intrigue of early modern samurai. By backing Katana, you're not just accessing a neat game, you're also supporting meaningful historical gameplay. Read my in-depth making-of article on Medium"

Talking with our backers, local players and playing games on our exclusive terrain we went a step forward and created You are asking yourself now... what is new in this project? Let us show you what we have prepared for you. No one knows who built it, nor what propose it served for sure. They were always there, near the frozen Bugk, in the death wasteland of Nowhere. Most people thought it was an ancient resting place of kings, others thought it is a necromantic ground because of the voices you can hear in the cold nights whispering your name in voices long dead...some say that it is just rubble and nothing more then vaporized stone. They were all wrong...Armies on an epic scale clashed in the ruins only fuelling what lies inside. Shouts of victory and bitter defeat sound in the walls surrounding this sinister place. Other ruins of similar design have been found all around the world but in each of them another sinister force can be felt. From the Frozen Wastelands of Nowhere, Desert of Mon'theran, Lava Pits of Sheol to the Forest of Felicia. Find out what connects them. It is your chance to evolve and not only be the General of thousand souls...but a Demigod of the battlefield.

I thought being her care giver would be temporary. I lost track of time, and after so long I realized I had let 8 years pass by. I have been unemployed living with her as she was unable to care for herself and I just got used to it, did not think I was getting older to. I have invented this wall mounted bag holder over a year ago, it is an offshoot from a wheeled base full size model. She is in a home now, and I need to get back on my feet, and thought this thing works so well for my mom that it can actually become something big. This wall mounted trash bag holder is on of 2 inventions she inspired. I made them to make things easier for her. When she does try to be self sufficient it helps to be able to at least be able to throw away the household trash, and to be able to swap out the bags. Pulling a bag out of a can (even a small can in her bathroom) got to hard for her and for me too as I found she just quit doing it! So I came up with a simple wall mounted trash bag holder. It is adjustable, it can fit a small standard grocery sack all the way up to a 55 gallon trash bag (well we do tie the rim of the bag down, but it works!) We tested it to hold up to 10 lbs of trash when using the included hook n loop industrial strength fastener, and up to 17 lbs when using the included wall mounting hardware. Still to be safe it is recommended for basic household trash up to 7 lbs. Yea it could do more but why push it. We did test it but then we just started using them (I say them because we also have one to hold her dirty cloths sack), still we never got over 6 lbs in basic bathroom or kitchen trash. However if this is used in a garage setting, we suggest placing it low enough for the trash bag to touch the ground so any extreme heavy loaded trash would have the floor to support it. Also remember to use the type of bag for the job. I want to take this to the next level, while I can produce them in my garage, I want to grow, turn this into a manufacturing business and produce them here in the USA with a commitment to never outsource the work over seas. I need help getting this started."

All four legs fold out, lock into place, and extend in height via easy release button. Adjust the platform height to suit your needs. When you�re done with your gig or workout, just fold up the legs, pick up your MyStage and you�re good to go. With Mystage, one person can do the job of a whole crew in minutes! If you need some more surface area, simply connect MyStages together with the easy connection tabs. With enough MyStages, you can build an entire concert venue by yourself! MyStage features adaptive leveling and stability. This means MyStage�s angled legs direct the applied weight outward to eliminate any movement or wobbling, even at maximum height! Set up your full kit and slam as hard as you want! Each leg of MyStage is also individually adjustable, so you can level out any uneven surfaces. MyStage was also designed to be sturdy, so rock out as hard as you want to - MyStage won�t wobble! MyStage�s surface is made of a tough, diamond-plate, non-slip rubber that makes sure you and your equipment won�t slip or slide during your performance. The material is light and strong, so you don�t need to worry about it tearing up or wearing down. MyStage gives you the space and confidence to captivate your audience. If you�re playing on a crowded street, raise MyStage higher to protect your gear and stand out above the crowd! Plus, MyStage is perfect for providing a flat, stable surface for a drum kit - no matter where your gig is. MyStage is also great for dancers and street performers of any kind - providing a safe, secure platform and professional aesthetic for your next stunt. Whether it�s a church fair, community festival, business event, or even just a birthday party - MyStage will give your event the presence it needs to take it to the next level. Get the extra height to make speeches, announce activities or gather a crowd for worship! The levelled and grippy stage also makes it safe to post up speaker and microphone stands and for your event performers to do their routines without worry. MyStage�s raised platform lifts you away from workout hazards such as rocks or roots. Do all your workouts on a level and sturdy platform virtually anywhere. Whether you�re doing plyometrics or jumping around during your performance, MyStage gives you an unshakeable and comfortable foundation for all your activities. Practicing yoga outdoors is a great way to connect to nature, but it is difficult to find a level surface. No one wants to risk injury with extra strain or feel a rock poking into their back during lying poses. With MyStage, you can practice yoga safely and comfortably anywhere. Whether you�re at the beach, in the desert, or camping in the mountains, you�ll be ready and able to enter your flow with full focus and relaxation. Turn any space into your personal venue, platform, gym, or studio! With MyStage, you will no longer be restricted by landscape or space. Rock out, speak up, hit hard, and stretch deep whenever, wherever. The world is your stage - never hold back. Pete Hurley practices ashtanga yoga and was looking for a way to practice in nature - like at the beach, mountains, and jungle. There was nothing on the market truly portable so after 1.5 years of designing finally invented the perfect portable stage, great for yoga and a whole lot of other uses too."

The entire album was recorded in his apartment, where he performed the majority of the instrumentation. He then set off on a summer of touring throughout the East Coast to promote it's release. While on the road, Spooky desired to perform his music as it was heard on the album, hoping that the audience would experience the songs as they were honestly meant to be. It was then that Spooky came upon ""The Truth"".

Launched in the Fall of 2017, Polyfold Presents has remained a cornerstone of our efforts toward creating an open platform for musicians to present new works. Coordinating five months of these concerts means booking the venue, Scholes Street Studio, deciding on and asking guest artists and their projects to participate, pairing those projects with Polyfold member projects, and of course funding - this is where we need your help. Polyfold is a grassroots, artist-led 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Brooklyn that helps create opportunities for improvising musicians to present creative works. With a core membership of five musicians, Polyfold produces concerts, recordings, and workshops in an effort to serve the broader experimental art community, celebrating open mindedness, honest expression and human connection. Our monthly concert series takes place in Brooklyn at Scholes Street Studio and provides an opportunity for two ensembles to present new, creative music with no expectations regarding aesthetic boundaries or commercial appeal. For each concert, one ensemble is led by a Polyfold member and the other by a guest invited by that member. Guitarist Jessica Ackerley and saxophonist Michael Attias performing at Polyfold Presents Our last six months of concerts were privately fundraised, which allowed us to introduce guaranteed payment for musicians, cover our venue rental fee, and cover our online promotion budget. The results of this financial help translated very clearly into a new level of artistic quality and diversity in our programming. In order for Polyfold�s goal of presenting new, experimental music from our brilliant musical community to continue, we need your support. Contributing to a concert series wholeheartedly dedicated to original work is not just an investment in one or even five concerts - it�s the planting of a seed for creators and audiences alike that will flower into continuously better, deeper work. Contributions made to this kickstarter campaign are tax-deductible donations. On behalf of the audiences and musicians involved in our series, and the members of Polyfold, we humbly thank you for choosing to bring this kind of artistic freedom into the future.

From parents in Brooklyn who were looking for a way to introduce their daughter to words, comes Wordy. A new educational toy line that focuses on bilingual learning products for children ages 2-5yrs. Wordy is a toy company of the times providing hands-on, no-tech toys with a bilingual focus. The Wordy EnSALADa We are raising production capital for The Wordy EnSALADa. The EnSALADa is a 28pc taco salad inspired play food set. Each piece features Wordy�s unique double-sided design feature with English on one side and Spanish on the other (more languages to come). The set promotes healthy eating habits by making a salad fun! It also provides an engaging cultural learning opportunity by exposing children to new foods or reinforcing the ones they already know. Read Your Vegetables! 28 pieces of double-sided learning fun! **""plato hondo"" will be closer together in the final product** The Wordy Mission It is our mission to create a World of Words where kids learn to love words, languages and cultures through engaging toys that fill their environment. The Wordy Story Wordy was born out of the need to provide an engaging way for our daughter, Anayah, to interact with words. We started labeling her toys around the house but the problem was that she would peel them off or try to eat them! So we thought there must be toys that come labeled and much to our surprise there was nothing out there with this concept. So I took matters into my own hands and made something myself! It all started with a ball...that Anayah quickly ""un""labeled. The Wordy Process As a director/actor I did not have much, let's say any, experience in toy making but what I lacked in experience I made up for with hard work. I spent the first few months of the process researching everything I could about the toy industry, safety regulations, possible competition, manufacturing, design...EVERYTHING! I have art and design training which finally paid off! After a few months, I settled on a few designs, the first being the puzzles. Me hand painting the first prototypes and Anayah playing/testing them for function. We learned a lot. Mainly...she loved them!! The Wordy Puzzles Wordy's first products were double-sided animal puzzles available in English/Spanish, English/French and English/Mandarin. They come in sets of three with cute little cloth storage bags that have phonetic pronunciation guides on them. A LOT was learned from the process of creating these puzzles and getting them to market. The puzzles have been a great way for us to build a network of enthusiastic bilingual parents and educators.

It is Wordy's mission to create a true World of Words where Wordy expands to have a large selection of hands-on print rich toys. Toys that will be culturally inclusive and speak to kids and parents in different markets. Kickstarter is the perfect platform to help expand Wordy. There is a built in global community that is looking to support innovative ideas and products like the Wordy Ensalada. The funds we will raise on the campaign will be to place our initial inventory order of the Wordy Ensalada. We need to place the order in early July in order to have them in stock by November for the holiday season. We will also use funds to development our pipeline of products. More to Come... With so many languages spoken and parents hungry for educational products for their children, the possibilities with Wordy are endless! We plan on widely expanding our product offerings to include as many languages and different toys as we can. We have made the decision to offer the EnSALADa in English and Spanish because we want to honor and respect the culture and people that inspired the set. The EnSALADa may not translate as well for a Hindi speaking family but there is a product that will. Wordy is committed to developing and building a line of products where parents and kids will find engaging product that speak to them and recognizes their cultural uniqueness.

Since that time I've experienced several life changing events that caused me to stop and reevaluate just what messages I want to convey as an artist and songwriter. Writing personal songs has always been a challenge and I've felt uncomfortable with the idea that anyone would care about what it's like to live in a blended family or the mixed emotions you find when you realize you've got a little less hair and a lot more wrinkles. But over the last 3 years I began writing more personal songs and slowly started sharing them. To my surprise I've found that there seems to be a deeper connection with the listener the more I share them. Being vulnerable can be scary when sharing personal stories and even more when asking folks to believe enough to invest in them. So I am taking a leap of faith and asking you to believe in these songs as much as I do. Each one of the songs mark a significant milestone in my life over the last 3 years and are more honest than I thought I would ever be. They represent who I am now and The Man I Thought I'd Never Be. Later this year I hope to head back into the studio and record an EP titled The Man I Thought I'd Never Be. I'm looking forward to working with Jimmy Smith once again at Clubmen Studio (www.clubmenstudio.com). Jimmy played an important role in helping produce my last album and I believe with his help, and your financial support, this album and these songs will have a lasting impact. We have secured the same talented group of musicians as the previous album as well as a couple new faces who have been gracious enough to come along for this next project. As you may be aware, recording an album at the highest quality can be expensive and this is where you play a pivotal role. I'm asking that you partner with me to help carry these songs from the spare bedroom in my home and release them into the world. If you've pledged previously this is your opportunity to continue to support the work that I do and the songs that I write. I�m asking you to partner with me in support of your belief that the songs I write do have a place in this world. The money raised during this campaign will be used to cover the following costs: Production - Production is comprised of a lot of different components but the majority of production falls under the umbrella of Engineering, Recording and Mixing. These components all work together to give each song a cohesive sound prior to the mastering process. The production phase takes the vision the artist has for the song and brings it to life. Studio Musicians - It takes great musicians to make great music! In order for each song to reach it's highest potential it requires the skill of excellent musicians. We have secured the same core group of musicians as my previous album that all share the same vision for my songs. Mastering - I have lined up the incredibly talented Nathan Dantzler, (www.thehitlab.com), once again to complete the mastering process for this album. Nathan has worked on projects for artists such as Niall Horan, Ellie Goulding, Kelsea Ballerini, Thomas Rhett, Ryan Hurd and Jon Foreman. He is a 2x Grammy award winner and I was lucky enough to have him master my previous album. Album Artwork - Rusty Hein serves as Resident Artist and Creative Director for Renew The Arts. He holds a BFA from the University of Central Florida and has agreed to lend his talents to the visual aesthetic of the album. Kickstarter Fees - As you may be aware Kickstarter assesses a 5% fee for the utilization of their crowdfunding platform which is deducted from the overall amount of collected in the event of a successful campaign. (If the campaign is unsuccessful no one is charged.) CD Duplication - I will be utilizing WTS media (www.wtsmedia.com) for the manufacturing of a limited run of CDs. WTS is locally owned and allows for a quicker turnaround time. Postage & Rewards - I've intentionally set aside a portion of the budget to cover the cost of postage as well as rewards. So Why Pledge Sooner Than Later? Research shows that there is a greater chance of a successful Kickstarter campaign when support is strongest in the beginning. By pledging sooner than later there is more of a possibility that Kickstarter will boost the campaign to the main page which could result in a higher probability of not only meeting the goal but surpassing it. By pledging sooner than later you're allowing others to see that you believe in the work I do which could result in exposure to an audience that I normally would not have access too. You have the opportunity to not only financially support this album but also serve as a conduit for potential backers. Will You Help Me Paint My Guitar in Less than 25 days! As the pledges come in we can track the progress by painting the guitar below. You'll have a visual representation of the impact you're support is making. Take A Listen!

These two skills � accounting and baking � may seem disparate, but they are to me the keys to unlocking a brighter future, one defined by independence and self-sufficiency. Let me give you a little bit of background on myself. I am 45 years old, and I live in Miami. We all believe in working hard and living honestly, and all our three children have made us very proud as they have matured and grown into healthy, capable adults. Recently, we have started to talk in earnest about expanding our cake baking business. This started out as a hobby for us, but over the years, we have developed a strong global network of customers who love what we cook up. Now, we would like to open a cake shop of our own, bringing the same pride and passion for which we have become known to a brick-and-mortar store right in Miami. I plan to call our shop Cakes by Louisa, a name that many people in the area will already recognize because of our ties within the community. Currently, 90% of our customers order from us more than once. This shows tremendous promise for what we can do, but to get started, we need your help. Our Fundraising Goal We are turning to you, Kickstarter, for help raising $10,000, which will cover the costs of launching our cake shop and then expanding our customer base. Every dollar toward our goal helps, and to show our appreciation for your generosity, we are offering thank-you notes, free cakes, and free catering. Other Ways You Can Help Beyond making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can help us by sharing a link to our campaign on any social media platforms you use. Spread the word about our cake shop � especially to those who may have tasted one of our cakes in the past. I appreciate your support greatly!"

With my partner Taylor Wang, 15, we�ve gathered funding and momentum around our latest project: an art show, featuring the work of other student artists like ourselves. We're planning to use the funds from this Kickstarter to help pay for the shipping of artists' works, and framing. We already have a space secured, and supplies for hanging and displaying works. The goal of this project is to make this show as accessible as possible-- No submission fees, no shipping fees, no printing fees for digital work. Just young artists coming together to make something special. We�ve already received a $950 grant that we're planning to use towards shipping and have just posted our call for artists, and the response has been overwhelming. Thanks to the sweeping wave of support, we have achieved most of our goal already. We only need $500 of funding to top it off. This is a non-profit event, and we are working as volunteers to put on this show because we know, as young artists ourselves, that we would really appreciate this sort of show. It�s often events like these early in artists� careers that give them confidence and propel them forwards. Student Art Spaces is the brainchild of Alice and Taylor. We met in our high school AP Art class, and just kept on running into each other. Eventually, Taylor texted me about an idea she had for a teen art show. At that time, it was just us and our prior experience in art. With no real guidance to follow, we took advantage of any resources we could find, such as local art museums and galleries. Our motivation was our trust in each other and confidence in our abilities�plus a little help from the Internet. Our first contact was my art teacher, Ruthie, who offered us a space at Seattle Artist League. The next order of business was getting the word out. By utilizing Instagram and Facebook, we promoted our competition online, as well as running ads and making physical flyers. It hasn�t been easy�With school commitments and extracurriculars pulling us in all different directions, it�s been a stressful few weeks. However, we�re confident in this project's success. We�ve had to learn a lot of things about business, marketing, and organization, and right now is an exciting time for us ripe with prospects. For more info, check out our website, at https://www.studentartspaces.com/ Taylor and I are excited to review submissions as the last ones trickle in during the coming weeks. We want to give underprivileged artists a chance to shine, without having to worry about the costs. It's going to be exciting to curate all the artwork. However, we also spent hours researching grants, filling out applications, and doing all the behind-the-scenes work that isn't so pretty. We are both very capable individuals who are determined to succeed, so please take a moment to support young artists on the rise!"

Currently, his work can be seen in AGE OF X-MAN: THE X-TREMISTS, part of Marvel�s �Enter the Age of X-Man� story arc. Along with his work on many Marvel and DC Comics titles, Georges is known for the critically acclaimed, sixties-era graphic novel THE AMERICAN WAY (2006) written by Oscar-winning screenwriter John Ridley and published by DC Comics, its sequel THE AMERICAN WAY: THOSE ABOVE AND THOSE BELOW (2017), and being a regular artist for Dark Horse Comics� official continuation of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and SERENITY (2007-2018). While you may have seen his work in your local comic book shop or bookstore, not everybody is lucky enough to live near a comic-con and get their hands on an original sketch or a collection of his work. That's why - for the first time in OVER A DECADE, he's decided to collect 46 of his most amazing sketches so that anyone can get their hands on them. The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough funds to print and ship the sketchbook and other rewards. Georges has brought so many great stories to life, including ""Buffy,"" ""Serenity,"" and ""Batwoman."" Who is Helping Georges with This Project? Hi, there! We are Kaba Lounge - the digital home and hub of all things Georges. We curate his online artwork, communicate with fans on social media, and create sweet merch - including this amazing sketchbook. If you're a fan of Georges or any of the dozens of characters he's brought to life, then consider yourself a member of the Lounge, too! Collectively, Lounge members have backed a bunch of kickstarter projects, and some of us have run successful campaign for comics and other fun stuff, for which Georges has generously contributed time, energy, and even original art. Why Now? In recent years, Georges has printed a few specialty sketchbooks to sell at cons, like the ones focused specifically on his work for the ""Buffy"" and ""Serenity"" franchises. But it's been over a decade since he's collected a variety of his work into a sketchbook that reflects his interests across the comics and sci-fi spectrum. Having seen the treasure trove of original art he's kept over the years, we feel like this 46-page sketchbook isn't only long overdue, it's also just the tip of the iceberg. Dedicated ""Buffy"" and ""Serenity"" Sketchbooks from Recent Years So, What's In This Sketchbook? Inside this 46-page sketchbook, you'll find a curated selection of Georges' masterful musings from the past decade or more. Each page will feature one amazing sketch that fills up the entire page. Below is just a small sample of the pieces that Georges plans to include... Sketchbook Cover and many more... What Other Rewards Can I Get? But why stop at the sketchbook, right? This is a Kickstarter campaign after all, and you expect some pretty amazing rewards. Well, Georges has 'em! Backers at different levels (described to the right of this page) will receive the following awesome pieces, depending on backer level. Original Comic Pages Comic book artists get to keep the original artwork they draw for comic books, whether those are covers or interior pages - and Georges has tons of amazing pieces! Early backers at the $250 level will receive an original comic art page, in addition to their sketchbook and other rewards. But hurry - Georges is only offering a limited number of these! Original Sketches INSIDE Your Sketchbook For backers at the $100 level, Georges will create an original sketch inside the front cover of your sketchbook! Artists like Georges typically sell these types of sketches in person at conventions, but for fans who can't always make it to a con, this is a great way to get your hands on original artwork. These will typically be a bust, and YOU get to choose the character! Limited-Edition Prints Backers at the $75 level will get a limited-edition 8x10 signed print of one of Georges' drawings. We don't know which drawing this will be yet - maybe we'll put it to a vote during the campaign, and let YOU decide! Stickers and Bookmarks Backers at the $40 level will receive a sticker and a bookmark, custom-made for this sketchbook campaign. Georges will only print one run of these, so they are destined to become collectors' items. Please Share!

Users of mobile phone devices are actively being outdoor and using their phones more than ever, a phone display with improved outdoor viewability is not only wanted but essential to many. Despite this compelling need, the $500MM/year screen overlay market in the US and phone manufacturers worldwide have no answer. Therefore we want to start the Eclipse Display Enhancer project � to enhance user experience, one display at a time. Our team in Eclipse project consists of experts in thin film coating. We have engineered, manufactured and operated production equipment across solar, display and aerospace industries. We have developed a breakthrough in anti-reflection coating that is not only able to significantly reduce unwanted reflection but also durable enough to withstand the rigorous requirements of cell phone daily uses. Anti-reflection optic works to cancel reflected light similarly to how active noise-canceling headphone reduces ambient noise � through wave interference. Active noise-canceling headphone doesn�t block noise, but rather analyze and inject ambient noise in opposite direction, so that they cancel each other out when hitting your ear drums. Similarly, Eclipse utilizes a phenomenon in which light speed changes as it travels through different optical mediums, and precisely arranges multiple layers of Silicon Nitride, and Silicon Oxide such that the light waves reflected from the top and bottom of the optical stack cancel each other out. Eclipse Optical Interference The Silicon Nitride in Eclipse is among the hardest materials on Earth, behind only diamond, and is on par with Sapphire. The ion source plasma technology we developed is the secret sauce behind the ability to produce this material commercially. Eclipse Plasma Eclipse is proudly Made in USA and manufactured entirely in our facility in Tucson, Arizona. Eclipse Production Through Eclipse, we hope to disrupt the screen overlay market and raise the bar for outdoor viewability to display manufacturers around the world.

I used to beg Mom to draw or paint things for me, and then give her my ""constructive criticisms"" until one day she said to me, ""Lane... why don't you just go ahead and draw this yourself."" I'd say that was the day my journey as an artist officially began. A inspirational aspect of this journey centered around a man who also had a close and loving relationship with his mother- Bob Ross. It was my Mother who introduced me to the man who, for me, has become an absolute legend and inspiration. Although my dreams once centered around creating art for a living, my life has taken a different path and drawing, painting and visual art have all taken on the role of occasional hobby. I have frequently struggled with making art a part of my weekly and even daily routine. As an adult (thanks in large part to Amazon Prime), Bob Ross has found his way back into my life. I began watching again as a form of pure enjoyment and relaxation, as well as way to introduce my daughter (now just over 1 year old) to one of my boyhood heroes. However, one thing I never realized about Bob is that he's dangerous, and if you're not careful, he just might get you inspired, motivated and digging your paints out of the closet. One day, I'd had enough and couldn't fight the urge any longer. I rummaged through some old totes, found a stack of canvases I had neglected, threw together some acrylic paints and said, ""What the heck?! Let's get to it!"" The fury that ensued was incredibly addictive and I had found the ""joy of painting."" I also found some frustration. While trying to accomplish certain techniques and effects, I realized were almost impossible as Bob famously used oils and a ""wet-on-wet"" technique, which allows painters to accomplish incredible things very easily and quickly. This is where you find me TODAY! Looking into beginning my journey with oils (which I've always found intimidating). After taking a look at the cost to get up and running I thought, as most artists do, I'd ask for your support and your patronage! After a little brainstorming, I came up with some rewards that I hope you will find a worthy return of your investment in an artist ready to bloom! MY PLAN After reaching my goal, I will be purchasing all things Bob Ross, including: -The Bob Ross 2-in-1 easel -Full Set of Bob Ross Oil Paints -Full Bob Ross Landscape Brush Set (see Brush Buddies backer level for more details) -The Bob Ross large French Style Pallet -The Bob Ross cleaning system -Full Bob Ross base coat set (liquid white, liquid clear, black gesso) -Value pack of 18""x 24"" canvases (see Happy Trees backer level for more details on how a painting can be yours!) Once I have all of my tools at the ready, the painting will begin and I be joining Bob in earnest on the Journey Through the Joy of Painting, going through each episode, learning techniques from Bob and using those techniques to create original pieces along the way. For all backers, exclusive access (backers only) to an Instagram account will be given to follow the adventure as I go, hopefully inspiring you to pick up some paints and start creating, yourself... I want to test Bob's theory... if I can do this, you can too, and we'll know his words are true... MY THANKS Before I even begin, I want to give thanks to all of you who will send support my way. My hope is that you will see this as a small investment in the future of my artistic endeavor to learn a new technique and skill, taking you along the journey with me, as I try to keep my passion for art alive and pass it on to my children, my wife, and anyone else willing to say ""What the heck?!"" and jump into the joy that Bob has illuminated for us all. Here's to the journey and my thanks! Lane Smith"

This film can't be made if it's not funded! Why I'm called to make a film about the Playa: The playa is the foundation, the support of all that is Burning Man. This project is a celebration of the natural world, creation, collaboration, and education. In many ways Playascope is the natural continuation of Lake of Dreams. The success of Lake of Dreams has had a huge impact on my work as an artist. It has supported my belief that there is a space for lyrical documentary work that explores the magic of the natural world, and how that magic manifests through art and creative action. While Lake of Dreams primarily explored how the art and creative cycle of Burning Man exists within a lake bed that in itself is an extraordinary natural phenomenon, Playascope will turn the lens to explore aspects of what makes experiencing this phenomenon so powerful. My goal is to open the doors of perception as it were, and trigger the subtle layers of feeling that connect us to the natural world and inspire us to create. I will be experimenting with timelapse, film, and aerials. The first project I crowdfunded on Kickstarter in 2013 became my short film, Lake of Dreams. If you haven�t seen or heard of Lake of Dreams, it is my pleasure to share it with you. It is the best example of what can come of your support, and how your contribution can ripple out into the world :) LAKE OF DREAMS LAKE OF DREAMS IN THE SMITHSONIAN An updated edit of Lake of Dreams is included in the Smithsonian�s exhibition, No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man, which first opened in the Renwick Gallery in April 2018 and is now touring the country to the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Oakland Museum of California!

MAKING PLAYASCOPE Roy Two Thousand making Lake of Dreams at Burning Man 2013 Playascope is building on my experience of making Lake of Dreams from conception to completion. One thing I learned from making Lake of Dreams is that my own dreams need more focused direction, and while I can bring all of my ideas to life, I can�t do everything at once. My funding goal is simply to be able to pay for travel, gear, and cover my basic needs so I can dedicate the time and creative energy necessary to make this film. Any funds exceeding my funding goal will go directly towards creating the full vision I have for Playascope, including Playascope Live, a Playascope VR experience, and Burning Man 2019! The film will be submitted to film festivals such as SF Film, Nevada City, and SXSW. It will also be released to the public where everyone can stream it on Vimeo and Youtube ad-free. THE EXPERIENCE Every timelapse is a collaboration with nature. The sun and moon, clouds and stars, rain and rainbows, dust, and shadows are my partners in this process. I try to incorporate Reflection, Meditation, and Connection in all my timelapse, film, and music processes. My goal is to bring the qualities of magic and timelessness to my work by incorporating these elements along with the environmental elements that I'm capturing. TIMELINE April 2019 - Pre-production and planning. May 2019 - Kickstarter campaign begins June 2019 - Kickstarter campaign ends June - October 2019 - Filming October - December 2019 - Timelapse processing + Post Production + Music Composition January - April 2020 - Music Recording + Film Editing + Mastering May 2020 - Playascope film complete! June 2020 - Playascope Live! BUDGET Bringing Playascope to fruition will require time, equipment, transportation, and camping: 1 month playa camping/RV rental (1 complete moon cycle) = $5,000 Recording studio time, engineers, musicians = $5,000 Equipment costs = $5,000 The budget is adjusted upward for costs I will have to pay for after the crowdfunding campaign: Prints and shipping costs = 10-15% of total raised Kickstarter and credit card fees = 8-10% of total raised In total, $17k is the minimum needed to make this happen. Beyond $17k and I can spend more towards additional equipment, adding layers to the Playascope experience! For reference: Lake of Dreams cost over $30k to make. $10k of that came from my Kickstarter campaign (after fees and rewards fulfillment), and the other $20k was out of pocket. My films are passion projects! I volunteer my time and labor, and I spend my own money to create them for everyone to enjoy for free :) This crowdfunding campaign covers the bare minimum cost of making Playascope happen! REWARDS Playascope Live Playascope will be a film of original footage and music, but it will also be the seed for Playascope live! One of the ways I want to go deeper with this project is by creating a Playascope live musical concert, performed in sync to an extended collection of footage from the Playascope film, projected in visual accompaniment to the music. Mogli has played drums and percussion on both The Fertile Desert and Lake of Dreams soundtracks, and we will be recording drums on the Playa for Playascope! https://www.themogli.com Mogli will also play live drums for Playascope Live! Playascope Live Backers will receive: 2 tickets to the debut performance A high quality video export of the visuals set to the music An art print made just for Playascope Live backers! Mogli in the studio recording drums for Lake of Dreams Timelapse Workshops Many of you know that I�m an educator and have taught digital film making and various film, motion graphics, and audio production classes for over 10 years, so for Kickstarter I have made several opportunities to share my skills and techniques!

THE VISION/GOAL The Goal of the STEM-based super hero franchise is to make it exciting and fun to learn about science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The objective is to entertain and inspire readers to possibly pioneer future medical breakthroughs in their adult lives. For hospital patients suffering from disease or difficult medical conditions, the franchise serves as a torch of positive thinking to help psychologically combat their medical setbacks through digital media, and action figures. For families dealing with health issues of a loved one, it can serve as a supplemental source of information to educate and create meaningful dialog between patients and their doctors. This G.O.A. learning experience is based on medical, scientific and historic fact. The story lines are based on actual medical cases. Families allowed us to interview them as they shared their experiences. Story lines will include: Sickle Cell Disease - The HemoGoblin Diabetes - The Diabeasts Leukemia - Acutetuus and the Evil Legion of Leukemiatnahh Asthma - General WheezeNcoughuss and The Nobreath Army Other story lines revolve around: Hepatitis C, Cystic Fibrosis, Lupus, Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, Alzheimer's, Breast Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis and more... The GOA digital comic book development has the support of a impressive roster of medical-science researchers and practitioners, who give input to insure medical accuracy and serve as Subject Matter Experts. The goal of the franchise is to achieve international distribution to every 2nd - 12th grader and up in the civilized world. Translations in English, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, Cantonese, Portuguese, German and French are underway for a late 2019 release. COMIC BOOK PRODUCTION FUNDING: $225,000 ($18,750 per issue penciling, inking, colorization, translations and editing) $25,000 (Upgraded computer equipment (3 workstations, 3D printer for action figure prototyping, and Radeon RX Vega 56 graphics processor with 8GB of HBM2 memory. $70,000 (Marketing, Promotions, Advertising, Comicon/SXSW exhibits, Travel). $30,000 Subject Matter Expert Consulting/Video Interviews ($2,500 per issue (12). THE CHALLENGES Our challenge is clear. To meet the release deadline of the Guardians of Acure comic book series by Sept 1, 2019, we must secure funding by July 1, 2019. It takes 8 weeks to produce each issue (6 weeks penciling, inking, color) and (2 weeks for video/content editing). However, because the base scripts for all 12 issues are complete, 2 issues can be produced in 10 weeks, 3 in 12 weeks etc. Once an issue completes the penciling phase and moves to inking, issue two can begin penciling. HARDSHIPS Even though we are accepting Pre-Orders via the website, the stress of trying to secure funding for production is a clear and risky challenge. Also, funding is critical for new computer equipment. Numerous program crashes occurred due to a crippling lack of memory to support robust graphics files. Creativity at times was limited by available RAM. THE OUTLOOK The interaction with the public introducing the series via exhibits, and connections through Linkedin with medical organizations (Alameda Health System, Seton Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) and others, confirm that once we are confidently able to release the products, the market is there to purchase."

How else to create + fund a dance about a trance state called Morso D�Amore? Caterina Rago and CRDance Company ask for your help now, pronto, to create: 1. A major new work called Morso D�Amore that upends the classic tarantella, a dance rooted in the traditions of Southern Italy during the 15th to 17th centuries, and is destined to become a significant contemporary work premiering in the USA in 2020. �To cure the body of the poisonous bite of the tarantula, it was said that three or four days of dancing in a trance-like state would relieve the body of physical and psychological trauma. In Morso D�Amore (Bite of Love), the dance is imagined as a state of ecstasy or rebellion, recalling a strange imprisonment. A cycle of capture and release is at hand in this complex work that crosses global cultures and examines both personal and political crisis. 2. Help fund the re-launch of CRDance Company, LLC.

The scores in this context are choreographic works that require not only training, but active interpretation.

I graduated Montserrat College of Art in 2018 and I am currently working in part as a freelance painter and illustrator. I work a part time job at the art supply store Blick, and I am a seasonal volunteer at non-profit New Urban Arts where I teach art to High School Students. I have created Illustrations for the book This Time They Hear You for the 826DC Young Authors Book Project, and opened my first solo show Edible and Poisonous this spring. I sell my artwork online and occasionally do conventions, which I would like to get much more involved in. I hope to continue to make awesome paintings, illustrations, and merchandise that can allow me to start selling in person more regularly. What is this project? This project is funding the production of four sticker designs I�ve created. Two stickers are updated versions of designs I have in my Storenvy and two are brand new. I use a combination of traditional colored pencil drawing with digital coloring to make bold graphic stickers with traditional textures. My Nautilus lady sticker is going to be holographic, which is super exciting! A color pencil sketch turns into a bold full-color illustration with the magic of digital painting! For previous stickers, I�ve had to print on sticker paper at home. This means that the colors were duller, the stickers were not weather-proof, and my options were limited in terms of material. The four stickers I�m creating in this set will have a variety of finishes, with two being vinyl (white background), one being holographic, and one having a clear background. What do you still have to do to complete this project? The designs of the stickers are already completed, so once funded I can have them printed and shipped almost immediately. This way you won't be waiting long to get your rewards! So what will you receive? At the lowest tier of just $15, you get all four stickers and a hand written thank you note. Each sticker varies in size, but none of them are under 2"" or over 3.1"" in width or height (see bottom most image for exact measurements). Each tier will receive at least one copy of EVERY sticker With each tier, the additional rewards increase. These rewards include extra stickers, buttons, showcards, postcards, bookmarks, and even a custom sketch commission! So why use Kickstarter for stickers? When ordering sticker designs off of websites, there�s a minimum amount of stickers you can purchase at a time. With the website I want to use (which I have chosen because of reviews and design options) the number of stickers varies on the size, but it typically isn�t under 30 per design. If I have backers to fund their production, not only will I know if the demand for this product is actually there, but I�ll be able to provide merchandise directly, efficiently, and cost-effectively. Aren't stickers cheap to make? $405 may seem like so much for something so small! So let me break down the cost: -I�ve allocated $50 for shipping, total. The stickers are small and flat so they should be fine in a standard envelope with a cardboard insert to keep them from bending. -In order to have the max amount of stickers in case every reward option available is backed, I need to spend $204 on the actual stickers (luckily, shipping is free). So far that�s $254 total. Cost breakdown per sticker. This is the number of stickers I'll need if all backing options are sold out. -I�ve allocated $130 of profit to me for my time creating the stickers, printing them, shipping them out, and creating this kickstarter. It also leaves me a bit of wiggle room in case shipping costs turn out to be more than what I budgeted for. This brings the cost up to $384. -Kickstarter takes 5% of the total in fees, so I round up the total to $405 since increasing the total brings the fees to $20.50, which, subtracted from $405 comes back down to $384.50. (If you made it through that section, kudos to you. I think that's enough math for one day!) Your support means everything. It is my hope you get excited about these fantastic mystical stickers and decide to back this project. Remember that each time you support an artist, you are helping to provide the means for them to spend more of their time and resources creating more wonderful art for the world. Thank you so much for helping me fund my Mystical Sticker Multi-Pack! Sincerely, -Max Reinhard"

About a year ago, I set out to write and direct my first film ever. Draft, after draft, after draft, I wrote up a story I truly felt would be worth sharing. Unfortunately, 61 pages is a lot of reading, and no one was willing to read it, the few who did begged me to either cut it short, or cut it all together. After months of frustration, an originally fully narrative story about a time traveling saint, an old man, and his caretaker traveling across america, was cut into a short film, about a time traveling saint, an old man, and his caretaker. And the director writing it all. What originally started as a meaningless narrative piece, turned into a rather...nutty therapy session for myself, a story inspired by films like Fellini's 8�, and more so, by Bob Fosse's All That Jazz."

Note: People who already own the ""first"" PDF will get the updated PDF free of charge. If you only want the PDF and you already have it, you are merely backing this project to help fund better editing, better art, and a cleaner layout. Otherwise, the print edition will be different and backers should consider ordering the new book if that sort of thing is important to them. This is a limited print run and not print-on-demand. That means high-quality paper and cover. King for a Day is among the best-selling books on Drive Thru RPG. It is generally ranked as a 5-out-of-5 stars book and is certainly one of the most complete, intensive, and best works I've ever produced. I've always wanted to improve the art inside and clean up some of the editing problems. And this is my chance. King for a Day is an extensive campaign-adventure-sandbox set in a semi-historic valley called Brycshire, which is roughly the equivalent of circa 800 A.D. Anglo-Saxony. The book is systemless and works best with low-tech, quick and dirty rules systems like Harn, Black Hack, or DCC. General themes include disorientation, fear, malaise, and psychological horror. No attempt has been made in the six years since it's release to give away too much about the adventure. The secrets inside are unlike what you are used to in traditional roleplaying game books. Any hint to these secrets will ruin the adventure. For those looking for more information, there are reviews online, though most are smart enough not to reveal anything. It is not my aim to be purposely cryptic for the sake of faking the drama. The adventure really is that different. I promise. The book is system neutral and can be played with any modern or old school fantasy systems. The printed book includes a new cover (similar design as before, but with a new symbol). The book is over 300 pages and includes over 100 locations, 200 NPCs, and 50 storylines, allowing gamemasters room to personalize their King for a Day campaigns. The book thoroughly explores and explains a living environment, explaining the economics, politics, and day to day life of the people. It is designed specifically to root the gamemaster into the world so he or she can run the game fluidly, placing the PCs into a myriad of complex storylines. New artwork, updated maps, and a few additions to the locations mark the difference between the original and this book. In addition, some of the interior fonts have changed, making the book easier to read. The PDF has some color, but the limited edition books through this kickstarter are Black and White (to match the tone of the setting). The limited edition books also have a unique cover, so backers have something no one else can get. For every 100 backers, each backer receives a free PDF from the post world games online store. For every $1000 raised, another piece of art is ordered and added to the book. There is already $1000 invested in new art for this edition, so I technically don't make any money on this project until around the $3000 mark. I am doing this out of love for the project. At $15k, everyone gets their books signed. Just kidding. Everyone gets their books signed if they summon a cookie for me."

There are also a lot of books. Consequently, there are a lot of books about bugs, and even a lot of books that claim to bring readers the very weirdest bugs they've ever seen. That's a noble effort, to be sure, and I respect anybody who has undertaken such a task...but every time I've seen a book about ""weird"" bugs, I've found it hardly scratching the surface of just how weird a bug can, in fact, actually get. That's why I'd like to provide you, your kids, and any other literate organisms in your dwelling with a book of bugs so peculiar, freaky and absurd that the average person has surely never heard of them all, and may have a difficult time even believing that all of them are real! (mockup - final product may differ) The WORLD'S WEIRDEST INSECTS (it's a working title, maybe the final one will be more interesting) will be a small, fully illustrated, full color book ostensibly for children, but hopefully just as eye-opening for people of all ages, presenting flies, beetles, bugs and other six-legged arthropods from the depths of frozen ice caves to the fur of woodland critters. Abilities, behavior and lifestyles will be the focus of this book, not merely insects that happen to look really cool, though hopefully you'll find a lot of them as visually interesting as their daily lives are eccentric. Each illustration will be reasonably close to the real thing, with a degree of cartooning, and all facts presented will be verifiable, accurate, and written in a way even early readers should understand! A few bugs in the book might get a little scary at times - we will definitely include a share of fearsome predators and eerie parasites - but we hope to emphasize that every one of these creatures are just animals, neither good nor bad, surviving in incredibly novel ways around the world; a colorful cast of characters that make our planet more fun by their very existence. The FINAL DIMENSIONS, softcover vs. hardcover, paper stock and other formatting specifics of this book are still in the developmental phase. If we get funded, we'll first be ordering proofs through a couple of different printing companies until we've settled on the best quality we can get with your money, and hopefully finish up the book within six to seven months - just in time for the holidays! Full scientific names and taxonomic information will be provided by an index for those who would like to research any of the book's subjects further. A sample of insects currently in CONSIDERATION for the book includes all those seen in our above prototype pages, as well as: The carnivorous bagworm - a killer caterpillar that builds its own house from the remains of dead bugs! The ice crawler - an insect that lives its entire life on glacier ice or in perpetually frozen caves, and can die in the warmth of the palm of your hand. Ant butt beetle - one type of beetle imitates the abdomen of an ant, and attaches to an ant's waist in order to infiltrate their nest. The ant is never smart enough to wonder why it has two butts. Gumleaf skeletonizer - a caterpillar that collects its own old, discarded heads every time it molts, stacking them up on top of its real head. We don't even KNOW why! Roridula bug - a type of predatory bug lives only on the leaves of a sticky plant. The plant traps other insects, just so its bugs can eat them and fertilize it with their poop. The bugs are, literally, the plant's digestive system. The frog-hunting beetle - perhaps this one would be a little too alarming for kids, but one type of beetle actually hunts and eats frogs many times its own size. That's basically like eating dragons for every meal. Jackal fly - these very tiny flies actually hang out with spiders on purpose. Not only do they share the spider's food, but the spider will allow them to clean its fangs! Amazon glow worm beetles - a type of beetle larva in the Amazon jungle hides itself in a burrow and glows green to attract other insects, then bursts from its hole like a jack-in-the-box to devour its prey. ...and many more! $5000 STRETCH GOAL: 30 BUGS AND NOT JUST INSECTS! Now TWENTY insects are the initial plan, but if we go up to $5000, we'll go ahead and throw in an extra TEN, which will include Arachnids, Crustaceans, and more! $5200 STRETCH GOAL: REALISTIC REFERENCE KEY! At $5,200, the book will feature some extra pages illustrating what all 30 ""bugs"" look like in real life detail! We may use scientific illustrations under a creative commons license with all necessary attribution and permission. Any we can't provide this way, I will do my best to illustrate myself! For an example, this is biologist Desmond Helmore's anatomical drawing of the New Zealand Bat Fly I sketched above: $5500 STRETCH GOAL: LIMITED RUN HARDCOVER EDITION! They're costlier to print, but if we reach $5,500, I will print a run of hardcover editions with exclusive cover art, limited to 50 copies! WHY I'M DOING THIS: All my life, I've loved insects. Insects are as exotic, fanciful and surprising to me as any mythological spirits, movie monsters or cartoon characters, yet they're real, and everywhere, and always revealing another secret to those who study them. It was my dream since childhood to pursue a career in natural science, and I even tried to make my own ""books"" about bugs as soon as I knew how to write, but undiagnosed ADHD and a stiflingly low income kept me from ever completing college, and I did what many people do when they fail to become a scientist: I consumed, and created, way more cartoons. But the urge to get involved in biology is as strong as ever, and there's nothing I think I'd be happier doing than spreading education and appreciation for some of the most amazing things we share the planet with. That's why, last year, my spouse and I illustrated and described 31 amazing species of spider on my website, for free, in an educational feature we called Spiderween. This book project is in a very similar spirit, but something I'm taking much more seriously as a new career endeavor. If it isn't funded, I'll try again with a slightly more modest goal. If this never happens, I've always got my online stuff, but there's just something that's always felt special to me about the prospect of making a real, physical book about science, and especially the kind of book that got me interested at a very young age."

Brave at Heart: The Story of the Sherman County Braves is a thinly veiled work of fiction based on real people, places and events that took place in Grant County Kentucky in the mid to late '70's. My father had a unique point of view as the team mascot and he is writing a comical memoir of the misadventures of him and his friends weaving in and out of the basketball season. In his own words, ""Brave at Heart: The Story of the Sherman County Braves is a coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of one team�s incredible and unlikely high school basketball season in rural, 1970�s Kentucky. In 1979 a group of high school basketball players from Northern Kentucky would make an unlikely run to the Kentucky state high school basketball tournament affectionately known in the Bluegrass as the Sweet 16. This is their story. It's basically a true story, (except for the parts I made up), only the names have been changed to protect the guiltocent. Along the way these boys established a bond that would last the rest of their lives. "" This kickstarter project is to raise funds to help defray the costs of publishing the book as well as getting assistance with editing/layout/typesetting/etc. Beyond simply telling the story of the basketball season and games, the book also takes a look at High School in the 1970's in rural Kentucky, pop culture, coming of age, and friendships that have lasted a lifetime. This story has never been told before and the fortieth anniversary seems like an ideal time to share this story with a wider audience. ""Before we begin in earnest, let�s set the stage a little, high school basketball in Sherman County in Kentucky in the late 1970s was a big thing. ESPN The worldwide leader in sports would not launch until four months after we graduated in September of 1979. There was no social media, no smart phones, no internet; home computers were still unheard of. It was a goddamn stone age. All mail was paper and not E. We only had five TV channels, three VHF, two UHF and the UHF channels were fuzzy. There were no DVDs, or Blu-rays and the only thing that was streaming was the creek that ran behind our house. If you wanted to see a movie you got in the car and drove to one of the new multi-plex cinemas or local drive-in. It was a different time to say the least. And people had to take their entertainment as they found it especially in the wintertime. Now in Kentucky everyone enjoys basketball on all levels, God love �em. At Sherman County High School back then we had no football team and in Kentucky it�s basketball that makes the mare go �round. So when November of 1978 came along, people in Sherman County were looking forward to the upcoming basketball season. The team had matured and they promised to be entertaining to say the least. They had finished the previous season at 12 wins and 13 losses and had been runners up at the 32nd District Tournament. No one in the county was looking forward to the season more than our basketball Coach. He couldn�t wait for his 1978-1979 Sherman County Braves to take the floor. He had 4 returning seniors and a deep bench. This year�s crop of Braves was the best group of shooters that he had ever coached. Coach had been preaching the gospel to some of these guys for going on 3 years and they were thoroughly prepared. All they needed was another team in front of them. They had been running up and down the steps in the gym since July and they were chomping at the bit to get started. When the school year began I had no idea what was in store for me. No idea whatsoever how my life would be changed by this Sherman County Braves basketball team. That year I was a senior, who hadn't done anything special. If anything I was running an overt campaign for 1979 class clown. I had discovered as a little kid that I could make people laugh and so I went with that. In high school I had the reputation of being stuck up, which I didn't learn until after it was too late to do anything about since I�d already graduated. I also had a reputation for being a bit of a wild man and for causing the Sherman County high school authority figures bucket loads of trouble. Back then there were no middle schools in Sherman County. Only four elementary schools that were still on the old fashion system of graduating kids from the eighth grade and sending them directly to high school. Throwing them all together on a hot day in August and calling them freshmen. So the friendships we had formed in elementary school became more important to us on that warm summer morning known far and wide as the first day of school. We viewed kids from other parts of the county with a jaundiced eye and it would take a while for all of us to feel comfortable together. When you�re a freshman you just want keep your head down and survive. But by our senior year we�d forgotten all that who came from which part of the county crap. After three years of the familiarity that high school breeds we�re all from the same spot, and damn proud of it. Sherman County High School. In December of 1978, half way through my senior year my world as just another Sherman County senior with a pretty face changed entirely. For the most part it happened almost overnight. One day I was just another guy going to class and putting in his time and the next day I�m the Sherman County Brave, the school�s new mascot. I had purpose and new friends, I had excitement and drama, I had duties and more new friends. I was part of something bigger than anything that I had ever been a part of in my life, family aside. I had a locker in the main locker room, I had my own uniform complete with war bonnet and there were cheerleaders in short skirts and all I had to do to fulfill my duties was to be myself. It was the best job I ever had! Being part of a team is like having a second family, and my second family was just like my own real family. It was big, it was boisterous, it was loud and it liked to show off. The only difference was that my second family could play basketball like nobody�s business and my first couldn�t. I saw it all from the inside. I was there, court side, the locker room, and traveling with the team to away games across the width and breadth of northern Kentucky. I saw it all and I�m here to tell you brother it was fun..."""

In 2018, 911 Alert inventor Steven VanDyke and his family were hit with two major emergencies. First, his sister experienced a massive stroke while on a family vacation and almost two months later, his wife�s cousin suffered a heart attack. His sister was fortunate enough to be in the presence of family members and had support through her medical emergency, but the cousin passed en route to the hospital. For days, she laid in the morgue as �Jane Doe� while family members struggled to understand what happened. Steven wondered what would have happened if his sister had also been alone or only in the company of her eight-year-old daughter. How long would it take for a family member to find out what happened? Steven knew that there had to be a more effective and instant form of communication in an emergency situation, leading to the creation of this essential mobile app. �THE INSURANCE YOU NEED AND THE ASSURANCE YOU'LL HAVE, BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT AND NOT NEED IT, THAN TO NEED IT AND NOT HAVE IT."" A Little Extra Security in Your Life. An app that immediately and automatically sends a text message to as many as ten preset emergency contacts when you dial 911 from your cell phone. We are developing an app called 911 Alert app that will immediately and automatically send a text message to as many as ten preset emergency contacts when you dial 911 on your cell phone. (redundant, two sentences that says the same thing) The problem is if we are in an emergency situation and our loved ones are not around, we need to call them one by one and explain the situation many times over and often this process is delayed and slow. 911 Alert app allows families and friends to connect instantly. To alert loved ones and friends faster when 911 is dialed. When a call to emergency services is made, the app will instantly and simultaneously send a text alert to up to 10 emergency contacts and open a chat channel for communication. Both the caller and their contacts can interact through the chat option. In many situations where a person is under threat from another party, this silent form of communication will be the only option that keeps them safe. The location of the primary phone will also be revealed to chosen contacts so that they can find out where the caller was when the emergency took place and if they are on the move. It�s ideal for any situation, but especially helpful for parents with young children who may not know what to do during an emergency or for people who live alone. When emergencies happen, you want to be prepared. You want to know that you have the tools you need to respond effectively before you actually need them. This is what responsibility is all about: planning for contingencies so that you can keep yourself and your loved ones safe. The more support that you position for yourself, the more confident you can be about your safety. Priced at just $5 per annual subscription, 911 Alert app is affordable for all, making this high-powered app an innovation poised to change people�s lives and change the way we approach emergency preparedness as a society. Live alone? Over the age of 65? Concerned about a loved one? This is the app for you! We are developing the app for both Android and iOS, and we are scheduling the launch for Fall 2019. Get connected today for your opportunity to purchase a lifetime subscription for you, your family and your friends! In many cases, the caller may be incapable of alerting their emergency contacts of an emergency and it can be days before family or friends find out that someone is in the hospital or worse. 911 Alert app is designed to act as that convenient and instant connection between a 9-1-1 caller and their chosen contacts. When a call to emergency services is made, the app will instantly and simultaneously send a text alert to up to 10 emergency contacts and open a chat channel for communication. Both the caller and their contacts can interact through the chat option.

Product Specific FAQs:  Will The 911 Alert App Work If I Use My Phone App To Dial 911? The 911 Alert App only works when 911 is dialed on a cell phone through the app. If 911 is called normally on the phone, emergency contacts will not be notified.  Is This Available For My Phone and Tablet? 911 Alert app is only available for Android and iOS telephones.  Does This Integrate With Life Alert Or Similar Devices? 911 Alert app at this time will not integrate with Life Alert or other similar emergency alert devices.  Does The App Have To Be Open To Track My Location? The tracking feature of the app is activated for emergency contacts when 911 is dialed from the initiating caller�s cellphone. Once initiated, the app will track the phone for up to 72 hours."

In 2012, I had just left my job in corporate fashion and immersed myself in international development. I visited a group of Maasai women in Ngong, Kenya where I saw their beautiful beadwork. Inspired by the bold colors used by their tribe, I designed a simple bracelet featuring the word LOVE in their traditional beadwork. The ultimate goal was to create jobs for their community. I chose the word �love� because it is universal, relatable to everyone in the world. It is the common thread that connects us all. Photo: Georgina Goodwin With that bracelet in hand on a flight to Russia in 2014, I asked two strangers from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan what love meant to them. I then profiled them on my Instagram. What started as a personal travel project would soon become an international conversation around the true meaning of love. I continued to travel�for six months to 50 countries. Along the way I asked that same question: What does love mean to you? I collected dozens of love stories and took photos of people wearing the LOVE bracelet. A social media campaign took root, and soon I was pitching the bracelets to American Eagle Outfitters. They sold 20,000 LOVE bracelets post-launch and created over 400 jobs in Kenya. Since those early days, I�ve turned Love Is Project into its own self-funded company. We now provide 1,200 female artisans in 10 countries with jobs, with plans to expand our efforts even further. A single bracelet has transcended cultures, countries, and notions of what love can do. And now, we want to do even more. Since starting the Love Is Project five years ago, I�ve heard thousands of love stories. Each one is unique, personal, and yet� so familiar. As I collected these stories, I realized I had the makings of an exceptional book. A book about romance, humor, family, triumph, and dreaming big. The profiles of the people in this book give voice to positivity and humanize different cultures around the world. The book seeks to inspire readers to foster deeper, more meaningful connections�and to live their lives with hearts open. Our supporters around the world resonate with the Love Is Project�s message of love, acceptance and empathy in defiance towards negativity. The Greatest Love Story Ever Told reveals how far love can take us all. For the artisans in these countries and beyond, love�and the efforts behind the Love Is project�grants a new kind of freedom. Economic empowerment Steady employment Over $100,000 donated to global charities Fair wages Educational opportunities Seeing women around the world run their own businesses and lives is immensely rewarding, and hard to describe in words. It�s another reason this book is so powerful. I feel lucky to have witnessed this progress firsthand, and it�s an experience I want to share with the world. Maasai mother, Ann, kissing her baby. Photo: Georgina Goodwin A MOTHER'S LOVE | Chrissie Lam, Founder, Love Is Project In 2017, three years after the #loveisproject campaign started, I was lucky enough to visit our artisan Ann and her community of Maasai women in a remote village outside of Olepolos located over the Ngong Hills in Kenya. We toured her new house in her manyatta, which is literally a home that LOVE built for her and her family. I heard firsthand how we've changed thousands of lives by providing stable jobs during drought years, allowing families to pay school fees for children and invest in other income-generating projects. For Ann, love is being together and sharing everything. I left them with photos and touching stories from customers all over the world who wear their LOVE bracelets with pride. These moments remind me that we're creating much more than just a bracelet. Love is in the air! Supeyo, shows off his Maasai jumping skills. Photo: Georgina Goodwin LOVE IS HOME | Georgina Goodwin, Kenyan Photojournalist ""What does love mean to me? Such a huge and wonderful question! It means connection, comfort and safety, a place of belonging, home. Knowing there is something out there � LOVE - that is so perfect and also so imperfect at the same time, challenges me to be the best person I can be. I love my work�my photographs�as it�s a way to connect with people, to travel the world with the purpose of experiencing, hearing and sharing stories of people and the environment. I love vibrant color, so my photographs are always full of color! One of my favorite memories of working with the Love Is Project is when Chrissie had this incredible idea to have Maasai and Samburu jumping on a trampoline wearing LOVE bracelets. She actually found a huge trampoline and lugged it to the Ngong Hills just outside Nairobi where we did the most fun photoshoot capturing beautiful Samburu men dressed in their traditional shuka (blanket) and mchanga (beads) jumping on a trampoline for the very first time in their lives! Their faces were priceless! The Samburu (and Maasai) are known for their jumping skills. When these very happy men came back down to ground and tried to jump off the earth again they were dismayed at how hard they found it to get any lift after experiencing what was possible on the trampoline!! What a day! I�m a passionate Aries born in Nairobi, Kenya � it�s my country, my home and my huge LOVE. Pretty late on�my mid-20s�I bought my first decent camera and started feeling the need to create by taking photos. That need has developed into a successful and wonderful career over the last 12 years. It was while on a job, in the deepest Tanzanian bush, that I met my husband. My work took me to a place where I found who I had been waiting for my whole life. I LOVE color, I LOVE new experiences, I LOVE the access photography allows me to our world - to travel, to hear and to share the stories of the people I meet and the places I see. It�s a privilege to have the life I lead."" Georgina is a contributor to Getty Images and her work has been published in the NY Times, Vogue, Elle, AFP. As an East African photojournalist, Georgina normally covers heavy topics, such as FGM, Fistula and Humanitarian Crisis. Winter on the Mongolian steppe. Photos: Khasar Sandag LOVE IS FREEDOM | Khasar Sandag, Mongolian Photographer ""I wanted to be documentary filmmaker growing up because documentaries reveal life on earth. They have no script and are genuine. However, when I went to university in 1996, I bailed on my childhood dream because I didn't think i could live off movie making in Mongolia at the time. I chose the most logical career path at that moment. Mongolia was new democracy and had opened its doors to business and capital, so I chose to study international business. After working in various fields including government agency, private business, international finance institution and a multi-national company I came to the conclusion that the only thing I didn't do is work for me and to love my work. At 34, I quit my day job and became a documentary photographer. This is the closest I could come to my dream job of documentary filmmaking right away. I met Chrissie few years back in Mongolia while she was on her journey through various countries. She had a dream of making meaningful, inclusive products and wanted to make change in the supply chains of distant and exotic lands. She had only one LOVE bracelet with her at the time and asked people to share what love meant to them. She used the only one bracelet she had with her to get photos and quotes. It struck a note with me because love is such a wonderful thing to give, share and experience. It is very intimate, yet people were happy to share their thoughts on it. Being able to share what love is for Mongolians is a privilege for me because I get to showcase my people, my country and their love through my photos. Come visit Mongolia, a land of wonderful people and magical landscapesa place where you truly feel freedom."" Khasar's work has been featured on Apple iPhoto billboards around the world.

Love to him means protecting his family, always being close and showering us all with licks. The excitement he wakes up with each morning is contagious-he can't wait to snuggle and play."" Cave-hopping in Petra, Jordan. iPhone 5 Photos: Chrissie Lam LOVE IS BORDERLESS | Chrissie Lam, Love Is Project In August 2014, the Syrian crisis was heating up with journalist beheadings, and Israel and Palestine were at war. Tourism to Petra, Jordan, had come to a standstill. The UNESCO site which normally hosts 5,000 visitors a day, now barely had 300. Traveling by donkey, my guide took me cave-hopping to meet the inhabitants of the modern day Bedrock. If you're Bedouin, you can stake your claim on any empty cave in Petra and make it your home...put doors in, paint the interiors, park your car in the cave garage. No rent. No mortgage. You don't even have to ask any one! As a former New Yorker, this is an unfathomable concept. I shared tea with the Bedouin patrol team at sunset overlooking Petra. Ahmed self-tattooed his beloved's name, Miriam, on his arm before she agreed to marry him. He's happy she said yes. They now have five children. ""Love is the best thing in life."" For Mahmoud, who has six kids, ""Love is a feeling that describes no borders."" Rakan of Jafar is also part of the Bedouin police force. For him, ""Love is something you want, but sometimes is difficult to get."" After a meal at my guide�s village, I went road tripping with Ahmed and Mahmoud. I asked them to play me their favorite tune in the car. Expecting local music, I was surprised when they turned the volume up on ""Gangnam Style"" and sang along to every word. Apparently, love is K-pop in Jordan. Photo: Martina Orska In addition to painting a picture of love�s power to transcend distance and circumstance, this book will also help fund future partnerships with female artisans around the world, so we can continue to pay it forward. These partnerships give women the chance to have their product sold on a larger scale, securing their economic future. This is more than just a book or a bracelet. This is about how the power of LOVE can change lives and bring people closer together. Thanks to years of concentrated, inspired efforts among the Love Is Project community, we have almost everything we need to make this book a reality. The only thing left are the funds to get it published. That�s where all of you come in. Your support can help us further expand on what we�ve done for so many years�spreading the love and shedding light on cultures that once felt worlds away. LOVE unites us all.

If we see success in sales in the Asia market, we will look to expand print production to Hong Kong to save on shipping costs as well. Self-funding this book project in its entirety was no small feat, but it was important to me not to compromise on the quality.

All of these life experiences have ultimately led me to the place I am today, running The Love Is Project and now, passionately putting together the Greatest Love Story Ever Told. I hope these stories inspire you and bring a smile to your face. Over the years, many people have asked me about purchasing my original Love Is Project book of travel photos and stories.

We're looking forward to sharing all these beautiful stories with you all. What better time to release a book of love stories than Valentine�s Day?

We're starting in an amazing place, but we still need your help. About Voice of Authority You know that voice in your head, the one that tells you you're doing it wrong? It's convinced Dean to give up being on stage and go work for his uncle. But now that uncle has disappeared, and the US government is coming after Dean for $19 million he doesn't have. So much for being practical. Instead of getting a lawyer as his most trusted advisor, Dean finds a ballet dancer. Zachary, a former Balanchine dancer and choreographer of the Metropolitan Opera, only ever want to dance, so it's all he ever did. It's what got him through World War II. He just may be the person who can teach Dean to tune out that pesky voice of authority. February 2019 performance at the Kraine Theater, NYC, photo credit Erika Conway Why this show? I�ve always loved stories about the kid who believes he has a destiny, maybe to be a performer, and even though everyone tells him he�ll never make it, he fights for what he wants until he shows 'em all. But what happens to the story when that kid does listen to the naysayers, including that voice in his head? When he gives up what he loves to get a ""real"" job? In my case, I landed in bigger trouble than I'd ever known was possible. This show is the true story about what Zachary taught me when that happened: life may make us all suffer, but we get to choose what we fight for. Lighting tech rehearsal at Pittsburgh Fringe � that stylishly untucked shirt was all the rage in Paris after this show Why Edinburgh? Edinburgh is the biggest arts festival in the world. It has the best performers. Industry flocks there. People find collaborators there. They learn from seeing great work. They test themselves on one of the world's biggest stages. I'm going there to get better as an artist, writer, performer, producer, and to see how far I can take this project. And the goal in creating this show has always been to take it to Edinburgh Fringe. Voice of Authority at The PIT Loft, NYC, in 2018, photo credit Todd France What's in it for you? 1. My eternal gratitude, although I probably already owe you that. 2. A chance to be a part of developing a show and getting it ready for Edinburgh Fringe, which is a pretty cool and kind of weird thing to do. 3. I want you to see see what it's like so I will send everyone who donates a photo of the day from the festival by email. 4. Much cooler than either of those though, is getting to have a drink with both the performer and the writer of the show. Live from Edinburgh. Behold the Voice of Authority official shot glass, my favorite reward at the $50 level. Bigger than life At least three times, I'll set up a live video chat from the festival where we can all drink a toast together, and if you don't drink, these are silicone, you can use them to make yourself a popsicle. And since they're silicone, you can also throw it against the wall when you're done, and still be able to use it again. The goal of this campaign One thing I learned from having the US government sue me for $19 million is that transparency is invaluable. With that in mind, here's a macro view of the budget for this show: Venue rental: $2900 Insurance, registration: $500 Publicity: $2000 Marketing: $1300 Contingency: $1500 Living expenses: $1500 Travel and accommodation: $3500 Fees for design, direction, tech, coaching, etc: $2000 Total: $15,400 What I'd love to do here on Kickstarter is raise the $5,000 I need in matching funds to secure the $5,000 pledge from the patron I met at the FRIGID New York Festival. The remainder will come from individual fundraising and myself. The point of going to Edinburgh is to grow bigger as an artist and as a producer. This budget creates opportunities to do that.

We�re passionate, we�re creative, we�re lighthearted, we love making coffee and having fun with our customers. Our mission is to celebrate specialty coffee while creating an experience that is fun, uplifting and doesn�t take itself too seriously. In the summer of 2017, Daniel Baum, our owner and founder, left his former career path in commercial photography to pursue his passion of sourcing, roasting and serving mind-blowing, single-origin coffee. Knowing that the key to a successful business is people, he aspired to eventually build a team and create the kind of positive workplace culture that he wanted to see more of in the professional world. In just under two years, Lemma has grown from a one-person show working local farmers markets, to supplying several DFW coffee shops and grocers as wholesale partners, to operating a mobile coffee truck, to most recently opening a full-service espresso bar on the campus of University of Texas at Dallas. Now, we are a team of 5 and ready to plant our roots and open our first storefront, which will house our roasting operation as well as a full-service caf�, in the Carrollton, TX historic square this summer.

Our coffee menu will include espresso beverages, pour-over coffee, cold brew, and much more Our food menu will include locally-sourced pastries, yogurt parfaits, breakfast and lunch sandwiches and more We are a DIY-focused business. We have built multiple coffee bars ourselves, and the build-out in Carrollton will be no different. We are performing a majority of the labor ourselves, including building fixtures, painting, sourcing and framing artwork and installing equipment Our espresso bar in the Arts & Technology Building on the UT Dallas campus Our Coffee Truck at Day of the Dead in Denton Here's our new home in Carrollton!

In its four decades, the festival has given voice to emerging playwrights, directors, performers, and production companies. Each year, the festival receives more than 900 submissions, and offers the opportunity to be featured in the festival to just 30 writers. To be accepted is a tremendous honor. Among the 30 playwrights in the festival, some have producing partners: educational institution or theatrical organizations � such as The Royal Court, Circle-in-the-Square, Ensemble Studio Theatre and The Yale School of Drama � that will provide creative teams and financial support. Other writers, like yours truly, unaffiliated with an incubating educational program or theatrical home, will self-produce the work, in order to have it seen in this festival. ""Partner Of�"" has been sheltered and supported, all over the country: It's had staged readings at Mainstage West, in Sebastopol, CA; the Midwestern Dramatists Center�s Conference, in Kansas City, MO; on the steps of the historic Mordecai House in Raleigh, NC, and the Ivoryton Playhouse Women Playwrights' Initiative, Ivoryton, CT. The play premiered at Rover Dramawerks, Plano, TX, with performances in the Between Us Productions' Take Ten Festival in NYC, where it won Best Play. The play is a finalist in the Garry Marshall Theatre New Works Festival, Los Angeles, CA, will be developed at the Association for Theatre in Higher Education (ATHE) Conference in Orlando, FL. It was published by the Coachella Review, University of California, Riverside. And with your support, will be featured Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Festival in NYC. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expose my work to industry professionals, I am delighted to have the chance to build the best play we can, with longtime director, Leslie Weishaar. Seeing how she will guide the piece makes this such a compelling moment. In the past year, I've dipped into my own pocket to self-produce in New York City several times, and each experience has had its career-building rewards. Here's what the budget for this project looks like: $450.00 ($25./hour X 18 hours for bargain rehearsal space, at Shetler Studios.) $75.00 for props and costumes (that can't be found or borrowed.) $150.00 for original music and sound design $700.00 for honorariums, to offset transportation for three actors, a director and assistant GRAND TOTAL: $1375.00 I am deeply thankful for your support."

AND MORE REWARDS ARE JUST AHEAD! HERE'S WHERE WE STAND: SEE BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS. But first, THE BASICS: Creating an ALL-NEW 102+ PAGE GRAPHIC NOVEL about 23rd century bounty hunter Mercy St. Clair, ""TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS"". Hi, I'm Ron Randall, and is my third Kickstarter to bring an all-new TREKKER story to print. TREKKER is my dream project. I began telling Mercy's story in the pages of Dark Horse comics. Now I've turned to Kickstarter to publish the rest of her adventures. Everything I love about great comics, great science fiction, and great storytelling finds its way into the pages of each Trekker story. Readers who like Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, and Blade Runner are going to find a lot to love in the pages of TREKKER. ""TREKKER...is a genuine badass...A female character that is sexy but not sexualized, that is tough but not without flaws and doubts, and that is dangerous but not without compassion... More Trekker, please.""-- Gail Simone �I love TREKKER--and have for a long time. What Ron's built with this series is a genuine accomplishment in this field.�--Mark Waid Like the previous books, TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS works as an excellent introduction to Mercy St. Clair and to her violent, eventful world as well as a thrilling new ride for long-time readers. And, like the previous two Kickstarters, the story and art for this book are already done. Except for a handful of special extra pages, all I need now are the funds to print the book and get it into your hands. In TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS, Mercy reluctantly leaves the arms of her beloved Molly to sign up for her most explosive, high-stakes journey yet as she travels into the farthest, darkest reaches of the galaxy. There she is thrust into ground zero of a raging war zone. Will she survive to continue her quest for answers in her past that will determine not only her own future, but the course of her entire world? In TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS the stakes, and the body count, rise higher than ever. ALREADY ADDED! We hit an earlier campaign goal when we hit 400 Backers, so every backer has already gained these three wallpaper designs in both tablet and phone-ready formats to every backer's rewards. Make your device a 23rd century-ready machine! First, a few special notes to bear in mind: �Every backer at all physical rewards levels will receive the special, Kickstarter-exclusive, signed watercolor print ""BATTLEFIELD MERCY"", PLUS the PDF DOWNLOAD of the new book BATTLEFIELDS. Both of these will be added automatically to your other rewards! �JUST ADDED! The original watercolor painting, ""The Girl Back Home"" added as a special, unique reward level! This is the painting that I made our watercolor print from. How about an afternoon picnic with Mercy and Molly? $350 TAKE FIVE WITH MERCY AND MOLLY includes the 16"" X 12"" painting, the book with signature and sketch, both prints, and the PDF. That's a lot of Battlefield Bounty for your Bucks! Only one! First come, first served! MY-- that didn't stay here long! Reward already taken. �Rare RITES OF PASSAGE: I have only ten copies of the out-of-print RITES OF PASSAGE book available for this campaign. This was the last Trekker book that I put out through Dark Horse Comics. And once these ten are gone, I'll have no more to part with. That cupboard will be bare. These are included only in the ""Deluxe Catch-up Bundle"", which is thus limited to TEN ONLY. These will go very fast! As I suspected, those ten DELUXE Catch-up bundles disappeared fast. BUT-- I do have the ""regular"" catch-up bundle in it's place-- everything except that gone RITES OF PASSAGE volume can be had for a mere $55! See, there's always a silver lining. �Retailers! I love seeing TREKKER on bookshelves. So you'll see a special Retailer's Reward Level included here so your store can be a vital part of the Mercy Campaign! Retailers can recieve FIVE copies of BATTLEFIELDS as a special discount rate. �I offer one ADD-ON reward, the complete DIGITAL BUNDLE of ALL of Mercy's stories to date. Close to 600 pages of every Trekker story leading up to BATTLEFIELDS, including several extra touches- like special stories and alternate covers--that I added exclusively to this bonus, catch-up pack. All of this earlier material (leading up to CHAPELTOWN and THE DARKSTAR ZEPHYR) is currently out-of-print! So you will not find a quicker, more convenient and affordable way to get every Mercy story and be up to speed and battle-ready! To add this, simply hit the MANAGE MY PLEDGE button, add $50 to your pledge amount, and send me a note via the Kickstarter message feature. If you have any questions about other rewards you'd like to add to your pledge, just message me through Kickstarter. If I can make it happen, I will! NOW, THE FULL LIST OF REWARDS: A TREAT FOR 100 RE-TWEETS: We did it! We succeeded in getting THIS TWEET re-tweeted 100 times before our campaign ends! So, every backer will get a special, digital Inktober sketchbook I have compiled of portrait sketches from several of my favorite TV shows (plus a few from my favorite comic book)! Spreading the word and finding more backers is how I get to achieve my primary Mission Objective: #MoreTrekkerMoreOften! So, NO NEED TO STOP RETWEETING YET! THANK YOU for your signal boosts! We are marching through a large array of extra features to be added to our campaign, all designed to make TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS as cool a book and as fun a campaign as possible. (Note: Digital backers will get the digital version of each of these, except for the Cover Spot Varnish.) Here's where we stand: Our first stretch goal lets me add a full supply of Behind the Scenes Extra features- everything from snap shots of the process steps I use to create some of the key pages in the book to initial character designs, to some finished character portraits. Enough extras to make you feel like you were there at every step of bringing BATTLEFIELDS to life! Our second stretch goal added a classy, distinctive spot varnish over Mercy's figure to the cover. If you have either of the two earlier books, you already know how cool this makes the book look and feel. If you don't have those earlier books yet, I can promise you'll agree that this enhancement will make TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS hold its place on your bookshelf with even more pride! Stretch Goal 3 gained us inside front and back cover art, to give BATTLEFIELDS an even more distinctive and classy look! I've always loved this extra enhancement on GN's, and I'm thrilled to bring it to our new book! And, we've just unlocked a Kickstarter-first for TREKKER: A FULL-SIZE poster urging you to join the the Trekker cause! This will come folded, and with a worn, tattered look to give it a real ""Battlefield"" feel. (Note: This is an initial design, and may be revised and refined before printing.) For our fifth Stretch Goal reward, let's add a little protection to our book, to keep it safe when the action gets heavy! I'll design a custom wrap-around dust jacket exclusively for our book! Another Trekker Kickstarter first, to celebrate the growing success of these campaigns! Next, a set of four memorable images from the BATTLEFIELDS story, printed as a Kickstarter-exclusive postcard set! AND THAT'S STILL NOT ALL. I have even more cool, exciting stretch goals waiting in the wings to be deployed as we hit these. So dig in, take aim, and fire at will to knock our way through these targets! SHIPPING: FULFILLMENT BY BLACKBOX! Once this campaign ends, I'm committed to getting TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS into your hands in as timely a fashion as possible, and to have you be just as delighted with the service as you will be with the book. And because of that I�m thrilled to be working again with Blackbox, a fulfillment company from the kind folks behind Cards Against Humanity! These classy and delightful professionals will assure us the best, most dependable, and timely fulfillment process possible! Having worked with Blackbox on my previous two campaigns, I know the level of excellence they deliver can�t be beat. They offer great follow-through at every aspect of the work. And in the few cases where something goes wrong with a shipment, Blackbox works immediately to address it. That�s professionalism. And it comes with a cost. The shipping fees that I�ve set for each reward level are based on the charges I get from Blackbox. This rate generally, though not always, cover their fees to me. I aimed at a fair balance of the costs. The rates you�ll see at most reward levels are: $7-$10 US $25 Canada $40 Rest of the world NOTE: International charges are particularly tricky. I intentionally set one, ""International Introductory Shipping Rate"" for international backers who order just the basic single copy of BATTLEFIELDS at the TOUR OF DUTY LEVEL. Honestly, at this rate I am losing money for these backers. But if that's what it takes to get the new book into your hands, I'll take that hit. WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? Creating a book like TREKKER: BATTELFIELDS isn't cheap. I've had to factor in the costs of printing, shipping, manufacturing rewards, Kickstarter fees, fulfillment services (yep--that great, reliable service from Blackbox comes at a cost)...etc. And while I'd also love to eventually get paid for the weeks, nay, months that I've labored on this book, I'm not asking for that in the campaign's goal. But I am paying for some invaluable expert aid to assure that TREKKER: BATTLEFIELDS is as good as I can possibly make it. Beyond those good Blackbox folks, our campaign in enriched by savvy editorial guidance from the Alissa Salah (Sleepless), splendid cover coloring by Jeremy Colwell (Batman/Ninja Turtles), and interior coloring assistance by Caitlin Like (Maiden in the Machine). I'm also once again taking on printing consultant and a production ace Rhiannon Rasmussen-Silverstein to make sure we get all the bugs out before we deploy. I need to recoup those out-of-pocket expenses to help me keep my own lights on while I draw away tirelessly and lovingly on the TREKKER tales that will, when we succeed here, follow close on the heels of BATTLEFIELDS!"

But there's more to the American Bowling Alley then just social capital. According to Stanford professor Raj Chetty, the rise and fall of the American Bowling Alley likely reflects the rise and fall of nothing less than the �American Dream� itself � the belief in upward social mobility. The American Bowling Alley is a bellwether of the American Dream. What do these bellwethers of the American Dream look like? What visual clues about the American Dream � lost or found � do bowling alleys reveal? BOWLING THE AMERICAN DREAM seeks to answer these questions, visually documenting the American Bowling Alley and its bowlers.

While in our pledge, the resin is included; according to Chemical Control Rules of Air Line, resin will be sent independently with printer; and the pledge of shipping cost is only a partial of the final cost, but the rest will be in our account (Notes: Gross weight is 10KGS for printer). Meanwhile, for the European region, the cost will be including with customs/VAT fee. And it's also an invisible cost, but we will afford it. (We're still working with the delivery solution of sending printer and resin together, and this logistic solution will be higher cost but more convenient for every backer to receive the package. We will keep update though.) Longer 3D has sold many FDM 3D printers for global users, and also providing SLA, DLP, & Ceramic 3D printing solutions for customers. With further communication with our customers and feedback from our users, reliable, precise and economic session are the key factors when purchase 3D printer in decision. Even we has pushed a LCD SLA 3D printer into market last year but with too high cost to popularize in market. Hence, after marketing survey and Orange 30 project was handed on the desk. For now, the next step is to move to mass production, being capable of samples, with the same level of quality. It will request us for more investment on new project, such as make molds, mass material purchased, assembly preparation and test, etc. And the pre-orders will secure here to help us to forward to the second stage. We believe Kickstarter campaign is not an end, but a start to new journey with customers. We have our own factory and has established the ISO Quality Control system to ensure the quality of 3d printer, and also have setup the US company for after-sales service and warehouse in US, and also as in Euro; meanwhile, we are also available in main social media platform for further communication and support. By pledging on Kickstarter, you will show us your passion on 3D printing, and your suggestion and feedback will be engaged in our development on this product.

I also teach sewing to adults and youth and mentor select children who show promise in fashion, art and design. One such individual is Zairion Lester. I have been mentoring him for 4 years. Last summer he worked as my intern helping me with a wearable art project for Habitat for Humanity's 'Women Build' fundraiser. He currently goes to Signature School and will start his junior year in August. He came to my attention when his teacher, Sarah Mabis, from Glenwood Leadership Academy, asked me to come check out what he made from scrapbook paper I had donated to her class. He built a Harlem, NYC brownstone out of foam core board, scrapbook paper and LED lights. It was the house of Harlem Renaissance artist, Lois Mailou Jones. I didn't know about her before, but I certainly have seen her artwork in museums in NYC and Boston since Zairion brought her to my attention. Zairion's brownstone of Lois Mailou Jone's Harlem residence I met Sarah Villines last year. Her grandmother had passed away and she was given her vintage sewing machine. She wanted to learn how to sew on it. And since my class has vintage sewing machines and one similar to her grandmother's, that was not a problem. Her intent listening and execution of projects was impressive and I could tell she simply loves every aspect of fashion by nature. Sarah is 11 and attended Harper School this year and will go to Washington Middle School next year. Typically, the team would not consider her because they look for children 13-17, but I convinced them that Sarah was their ideal candidate and they would not be disappointed. Sarah has been upcycling her dresses into crop tops for a few years. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We are all honored to be selected to compete in the very first Indiana Fashion week June 18-22 in Indianapolis. Zairion & Sarah will compete in the 'Youth Design Challenge' and I will compete in the 'Super Model Market Challenge'. In addition to that, I have been selected to be a Sewing Mentor at this very prestigious event, mentoring one-on-one in that same Youth Design Challenge. (Although, I seriously doubt I will be paired with Zairion or Sarah.) Zairion and Sarah will shop at Goodwill Indy on 6/18 with 4 other teenagers and select clothes they will 'upcycle' into a new, fresh design. On 6/19 they will spend the day with individual sewing mentors (me included) designing, sketching and creating on the sewing machine. On Saturday, their designs will go into a runway show, which will be the first official runway show of Indiana Fashion Week! My design challenge is a little different: I've been given a mood board with different color palettes from the color wheel...red+orange/blue+green/yellow+gold. The theme for the display models is ""The Super Model Market"". Think high fashion and Met Gala. I'll be honest with you high fashion, couture is not a comfortable category for me, but certainly the quirky pop art accessories are something that I love. (I've designed a Tang handbag and the wild astro umbrella hat shown in our group photo...I know, crazy, right?!) Super Model Market Challenge Designer Showcase The Tang handbag So how did this all come to be you ask??? Recently, I applied for a Creative Entrepreneur Scholarship that the Arts Council of Southwest Indiana announced. I was honored to receive that grant through the Indiana Arts Commission On-Ramp program. During a panel discussion I met Mich(ael) Weston, a Fashion Branding guru from NYC, although he originally started out as a pastor in Indiana. Anyway...during his talk he began to map out the details of Indiana Fashion Week and I was hanging on his every word. We had already begun to chat before his talk as he had noticed my newly designed bomber jacket. And after the talk, I wanted him to know about some of my sewing students. He insisted I send him their names for the youth competition. And one thing simply led to another...and the ball has not stopped rolling yet. It is the very first time Indiana will be presenting this event, a brain child of Denisha Ferguson, designer of D'Lang Designs. There will be a strong presence of New York's Fashion Week represented. As a matter of fact, Fern Mallis, the woman who initiated New York's will be honored at www.IndianaFashionWeek.com (Watch the documentary ""The Tents"" to learn her story, it's fascinating!!!) So you see, Indiana has way more to offer than just corn, Indiana is fashion too...who even knew? This is an incredible opportunity for us to represent our city of Evansville and shine. I met with Zairion and Sarah to bring them up-to-date on expectations and have given them assignments to discover more about this event. They just finished school for the year. We will likely do a trial run at our local Goodwill to be better prepared. I've already purchased all of my fabrics, baubles and bits for my challenge, which has taken over my house. We will head to Indy with the parents chaperoning the week of June 18th-22nd to compete and volunteer in Indiana Fashion Week. And with that comes a budget of expenses we will incur and we need your love and support. Here is the breakdown on expenses: Hotels (x3 rooms) for 5 nights $1,500. Gas there and back for 3 cars 210.

I am Christina Reynolds, better known under the artist name Chante Venuz, and the screen-name ClickaClackPopPop, of DeviantArt (or 1AlmightyFabl, of Discord)! For years, I have always wanted my own business, ever since I was about 7 years old roughly. XD Yes, I was a very studious child in that regard. Boring, I know, but when you have a dream, you gotta just go for it, you know? I wish to finally turn that dream a reality, through several steps: Raise the money! I chose $1000 as the goal in order to cover ALL the cost of creation: Getting the website built, buying the licenses to become a full fledged merchant, having enough money for the first stock, and the finances to ship said stock out to my customers. Get the website created! The second, but easily one of the most important processes. I will be seeking a professional to design the site to be as user-friendly as possible, with the look I want. Get the Licenses! As always, the government demands all merchants to have these licenses in order to sell and actually set up shop. Can't go without 'em, such as the EIN ( Employer Identification Number)! The first stock! Where most of the money will get dunked on. I aim to sell many things, from beautiful crystals and geodes to earthly smudge sticks, from informative books to colorful tarot cards! And, of course, getting my art printed from a computer format into tangible items, such as portraits to hang on the wall, cups, shirts, key-chains, and so forth. As you can see, it's quite a bit that needs to be done, once the financial goals are met! With your help though, I'm sure to make these hopes and dreams a reality, through hard work and determination on my end, and gracious donations from yours~<3 Thank you so much for your time, everyone!"

A good read full of passion and craft."" -- Mark Waid (about Vol. 1) WHO WOULDN'T PUNCH A NAZI ... AGAIN? Everybody knows who the Nazis are. More so, if you saw a Nazi, you would want to punch that Nazi right across his face. ALWAYS PUNCH NAZIS is the next best thing to actually punching a Nazi. This 66-page anthology addresses the Nazi-like racism that has been growing in America. The creators of Always Punch Nazis focus on the rising issues in America and how to handle bigots who want to oppress the country's citizens. This satirical anthology tells stories inspired by an evil that, although defeated during WWII, continues to fester today. You will learn lots of effective ways to deal with a Nazi, what happens when super-heroes fight for what they believe, how a certain comic book creator handled the Nazis when they knocked on his door (which you can preview below), and many more fun tales about standing up for what is right. Always Punch Nazis Volume 2 Cover by Chuck Wojtkiewicz WHY DID WE RETURN? The first volume of Always Punch Nazis garnered an incredible amount of attention. Word spread about Pilot Studios' mission to share stories and inspire people to battle against racism. Creators from various mediums approached the studio about contributing to the cause. That was the moment the creators realized we needed to continue producing Always Punch Nazis. Thus, Volume Two was born. ""What's Better Than Punching a Nazi?"" story included in APN Volume 2 OUR MISSION These anthologies are not about earning money. They are about spreading the word and educating people about racism, which continues to grow in our country. With a small goal, Pilot Studios can guarantee that you will receive the anthology that you so eagerly support. That bodes the question ... WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? Every Always Punch Nazis creator donated his or her time and talent to this book in exchange for copies of the book. The reward tiers are priced to cover the cost of printing and shipping the books, both to backers as well as over thirty contributors. The price also covers the Kickstarter fees. Any extra money raised will go to the production of Always Punch Nazis Volume 3.

Any Gama started in early 2017 as a collaboration between myself and Brazilian drummer. By the end of 2017, we managed to collect 5 more people and go to a recording studio together to do our first ever live session. The session resulted in a series of high quality music videos. Here's our first original single, ""Running Ahead"": And here's our gorgeous instrumental rendition of David Bowie's immortal classic ""Space Oddity"": Since then we've played every kind of gig there is to play in New York, and now I want to grow bigger. Last time I did this session with 7 people, now I'm doing it with 21 - bass, drums, piano, guitar, flute, 2 violins, viola, cello, 3 trumpets, soprano sax, tenor sax, baritone sax, 2 trombones, tuba, percussion, snare drummer and two singers. On May 26th I'm going to gather everyone in Bunker Studios in Williamsburg for a day of wonderful multicultural music. We'll recover 6 songs, 4 of them originals and the other two covers for two songs that are very special to us: the first one is a beautiful instrumental version of the Bolivian song ""Llorando Se Fue"" by Los Kjarkas, the second one a first ever English cover to a well-known hip Israeli song ""We Just Wanna Give You the Funk"" (   ') by Mercedes Band. We believe in creating music that combines many different influences from all over the world. If music is the international language, what we do is a conversation. We come from many traditions, most prominently the jazz fusion scene from the seventies until today. We are happy to create a multilayered sound that speaks to anyone who enjoys good music, no matter where they come from. Come and be a part of our journey!

That's the heritage of the Lutherans; lots of congregational song, lots of music, and all held to the highest imaginable standards set by the quintessential Lutheran musician, J. S. Bach. It struck me that I could find a voice by setting the Psalms to modern music styles, meaning the gospel inflected r & b that we all loved in the 70's exemplified by the band Earth Wind and Fire. That music was infectious and uplifting-wouldn't it be great if church music could sound like that? Wes Skold from theproducerwes.com Well of course music does sound like that in the African American church. Jazzy chord voicings, rhythmic grooves, and improvisation is a big part of the gospel style. So my mission really turns out to be about bridging the gap between these two disparate and historic traditions. I like challenges. Ty Lemar When I began writing these psalm settings I knew they would be popular in my church, Nativity Lutheran in Rockport, Maine, and my choir loved to sing them. So naturally I wondered if there might be a wider, more national audience for this music. In order to check that out, I had no choice but to commit myself to finding the best talent and making the best sounding recordings that I could afford. What emerged was the plan to record three of the set and then try to kickstart support for the rest of them. I had recorded Garageband demos at my studio but the quality wasn't good enough to convince others to help me to finance better recordings. Thankfully my nephew Wes Skold was setting up his own recording business in Philadelphia and found the singers with the perfect feel for this music. After collaborating long distance on the basic tracks we assembled for this moment. Here is the Philadelphia crew. From lower left clockwise we have Devaun Brown, Charles Brown, Layla Jones, Jess Taylor andTy Lemar. This scene is from the end of April when we finally all got in the same room and recorded the chorus parts over the course of three days. Ty Lemar had previously recorded his superb lead vocals. What a pleasure to finally hear a complete recording with such amazing voices! Thanks to all! Now you can listen to the first three here. Psalm 40, Psalm 121, and Psalm 23. LISTEN HERE! https://soundcloud.com/cbrownjr Now the fun part begins. Finding our audience. With our ace team now assembled we are ready to tackle whatever comes next, including the remaining 147 Psalms. Will what we have begun with so much promise and potential take on a life of its own? Kickstart it!"

Ten years ago we quietly launched our company out of a garage on a single item, The Full Side Zip Ski Pant 2.0. We thought that by offering a high quality product in ten colors, backed by exceptional customer service and at tremendous value might mean something. Turns out we were right! Five years ago we launched our revolutionary Raceflex Speed Suit on social media turning the industry upside down. It has quickly become the fastest selling speed suit in the market. Many brands in the outdoor industry are actively promoting next year's gear on Kickstarter, so we decided why not give it a try and give our followers a chance to see it first and offer a preorder price in exchange for their early support! So today we introduce the Featherlyte Jacket and Vest, a unique concept offered at an exceptional value to early supporters. We are happy to answer any further questions via the FAQ and comment pages."

I wanted this shirt to be THE t-shirt we all reach for first after laundry day - regardless of the design. And I gotta say - THIS IS IT! This t-shirt is not only manufactured with 100% organic cotton but the drape is perfect, the fit is roomy (but feminine), it's long enough in the sleeves and the torso and it's just straight-up comfy. I ended up sourcing from Loomstate which is all around a responsible company. Next, I worked with several designers to nail down these refined, beautiful and cheeky designs. I see these shirts worn alone or layered. They are really cool both ways. I picked this soft black because it wears and washes really well but more than that, no pit stains (natural deodorant is NO JOKE!) MORE: Tax and US domestic shipping are included.

THE STORY In NIGHT IS FALLING, brother and sister Valerie and Joshua Haskell are moving from New York City to Jonah's Harbor, Maine, ostensibly because their dad has a new job in the town. But it's a chance for a new start in many ways, as Valerie has been dogged by cruel rumors at their former school, and Joshua has been kicked out for fighting. They soon discover that the Jonah's Harbor kids who take them into their circle have been keeping a dangerous secret, and cultivating a plan to save the town from an unspeakable evil. THE SETTING Jonah's Harbor, Maine is a tiny coastal mill town, which in the summer of '77, finds itself once again in transition. The mills are closing, and previous industries (shipbuilding, shoe manufacturing, poultry) are gone for good. Will the town's salvation come in the form of new businesses taking advantage of the cheap land and an eager labor pool, or will a darker force capture Jonah's Harbor in its evil grip? WHO WILL LOVE NIGHT IS FALLING? People who grew up on movies like Fright Night, Lost Boys, The Goonies, Stand By Me, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Gate, Monster Squad, Gremlins, E.T., Cloak and Dagger, War Games� any of those timeless classics from the 80s where it�s up to the kids to save the world.

Scroll down for a sneak preview! The Crimebusters is a mystery adventure featuring a team of student sleuths who uncover a deadly secret. When one of the most beloved professors at bucolic Curtiss Tech college turns up dead, amateur detectives Chuck Chandler and Trixie Trouble must reluctantly team up to solve the mystery of his demise. Was it suicide... or supernatural? Who will love The Crimebusters? What secrets await you inside the first issue of The Crimebusters? The Crimebusters is a 36-page comic in standard American comic size, printed on high quality paper This first issue includes the complete, self-contained 30-page comic adventure novel ""Return of the Death Mask!"" printed in glorious black-and-white! It also includes a full color cover, a character bio sheet, and a two-page text feature discussing the genesis of The Crimebusters and stars Chuck Chandler and Trixie Trouble backers at every reward level will also receive a digital PDF copy of the comic, including bonus features like concept sketches, character designs, variant covers, and a tease for future issues! this first issue is 100% completed and will go to print as soon as this campaign ends! All stretch goals have been fully unlocked! Who am I and why am I passionate about The Crimebusters? My name is Scott Harris, and I am the creator of The Crimebusters. I've spent the past several months doing every aspect of this issue: the writing, the art, the lettering, everything. It's been a ton of work � and I've loved every minute of it. As a kid, I loved teen detective stories, reading and collecting every volume of series like The Three Investigators and Trixie Belden. As an adult, I rediscovered that love when I came across a comic book character named Crimebuster. An amateur sleuth who helped solve cases while attending college, Chuck Chandler's adventures took him from abandoned mines in upstate New York to Spanish bullfighting rings to the Amazonian rainforests. The Crimebusters creator Scott Harris cosplaying as Chuck Chandler at Boston Comic Con in 2016. I wanted to read more, but there was one problem: the series ended in 1956. And I couldn't find anything like it in today's comic book market. I realized that if I wanted to read more, I'd have to make it myself � and since Chuck Chandler is in the public domain, I could. Still, there was something big missing, which is why I created Trixie Trouble, a spunky and tenacious reporter in the long tradition of classic characters like Veronica Mars, Nancy Drew, and Lois Lane. From the moment I read my first comic book at the age of 10, I've known I wanted to make my own comics. But it took a very special story and a couple of very special characters to turn ""wanted"" into ""needed."" I really hope you enjoy The Crimebusters as much as I do, and I can't wait to begin working on the next adventure! What exactly is this Kickstarter for? This Kickstarter is primarily to fund the printing of the first issue. But it's also because I believe Kickstarter is the best venue for independent comic creators to introduce their work to the world. There are so many passionate comic book fans and creators doing interesting work on Kickstarter � work that you can't find anywhere else � and I want to be part of that. Uncover the mystery of... the Death Mask! Check out the first six pages from the first issue of The Crimebusters right now! All Reward Levels Include FREE Shipping Inside the United States! The PDF, included at every reward level, features a ton of bonus stories and material, including concept drawings! The Crimebusters fulfillment timeline Here's a projected timeline for the production and distribution of The Crimebusters, which is 100% complete and will go to the printers as soon as this Kickstarter campaign ends:"

I chose this idea of mine to use because it is the simplest, and I believe most easily marketable of my ideas. If this goes well, there will be other product projects in the near future. The idea is simple. It's a wand to attach all of your (up to four) remote controls to. There are remote control caddies out there, and also universal remote controls to control several different devices at a time. But, neither of those products work very well, or achieve the intended result. This remote control wand would have all of your most important remote controls attached to it, so that you just have to grab for one object in order to control your main devices. No more searching around for remote controls, or sifting through the remote control caddie looking for the correct one, or having to put up with a universal remote control that doesn't full work all that well. This is a simple and low-tech solution for our high-tech world. I will include a simple diagram of the proposed end result, as well as pictures of my prototype. It would be made of hard molded plastic - so it could possibly come in several colors or patterns. On each flat side would be a strip of powerful velcro. A matching strip of velcro would then be put on each remote control. And, once the velcros are joined, your remote controls go wherever the wand goes. Just like attaching something large to a set of keys so that you don't lose them, the same mental trick works with this wand. When all of the remote controls are attached to the wand, each individual remote control cannot be lost, the group of them on the wand is easy to find, and the whole device is easy to manipulate. The goal is for $30,000. Doing the research on getting a new product from idea, to prototype, to production and distribution requires capital. I am past the idea and prototype phases. The most expensive parts are yet to come: production and distribution. In order to protect the idea, I need to hire a patent attorney to submit the paperwork and to keep on retainer to protect the idea. That is about $10,000. Once patented, I have to market it and produce it. That would be another $10,000. And, the final $10,000 would be for incidentals along the way. It would be marketed as a household gadget, much like how you see hanging on store shelves, maybe even marked as ""As Seen on TV"". But, to get this idea into production, I need to be creative and flexible with my options. I thank you for taking the time in reading this, and thank you in advance of your involvement. I am personally invested into this, and my future projects. So, I promise timely updates along the way. Thank you."

I've also created versions with ""parent"" in black and white, hearkening to the ally pride flag. These would be intended for trans-parents --- wait. Trans parents? Trans-parents? Y'all get the idea.

We're Self Taught No Lessons, a garage rock band outta Cleveland, Ohio with a punk twang sound. We are a mostly-family, all-friend band who formed the group late one tequila-fueled evening much to all of our surprise. We are releasing our four song vinyl EP called Packin' Up at the end of June, and using Kickstarter for pre-orders and to cover a bit of the cost of this DIY band life. We'd love to get this weird little record in your hands! Our guitarist, Joel, lives for recording gear and found himself a Tascam 4-track 414 on a swap page. For a bit of fun, we started recording a few songs with the 4-track and soon realized that our songs sounded pretty damn good straight to tape. We spent the better part of Summer 2018 holed up in our basement studio doing it live 'till we got the takes just right. We picked out four favorite tunes to fit on a 7"" record: Slow Song (a song about boozin'), Fantastic Beasts (a song about being fat and fantastic), Time Waste (a song about ""nice guys"") and Dot (the song that gives the EP its name). The songs on the vinyl were mixed and mastered 100% analog and cut to lacquer from cassette tape at Well Made Music. We have a few other rewards for your support as well: Packin' Up on cassette with bonus tracks (two of which can be heard on our Spotify a Bandcamp pages), test presses, t-shirts, stickers, buttons, cover songs, and recording sessions with our guitarist and sound engineer, Joel! ~sizes s-xl, also available in army green~ Any money made over our goal will go toward recording our full length record and a big bottle of tequila. Hope to see you at our record release show Friday June 28th at The Happy Dog in Cleveland, Ohio. Thanks ya'll! <3 Anna, Ashley, Joel, & Johnny"

AND WE HAVE SOME GREAT REWARD NEWS. We've set a new goal of $12,000 and if we can hit our mark we'll be sending EVERYONE who has contributed to the Kickstarter a Bob Mizer exclusive. A rare DVD of some of Bob's most iconic film work, from 1958 to 1980. This is a special, one-hour DVD that was produced exclusively for the 2009 Taschen book BOB'S WORLD. _______________________________________________________________- June 23 UPDATE : WE'VE REACHED OUR GOAL AND HAVE A PLEDGE MATCH! Hello Bob Mizer Fans We�ve got some exciting news regarding THIS Kickstarter fundraising campaign. Watch this quickie video from Mizer spokesman Josh Paul Thomas, he�s laying out all of the fun facts for you. Yep, one of our longtime super fans of The Bob Mizer Foundation called us last night and announced that we would match your pledge to our campaign dollar for dollar. (Up to one thousand dollars). So, like: You pledge twenty dollars and he�ll match your pledge with twenty dollars. Or you raise your current bid by $30 [for example, for $116 to $146] and he�ll match your pledge with 30 dollars This is a great way to double your fandom of all things Bob Mizer. Thank you everyone! The Bob Mizer Foundation Family ___________________________________________________________________ We�d like to put a pause on our regular monkey business and ask for your help. So many things have changed since Bob Mizer�s time as a publisher, but one thing hasn�t � the publishing world is a difficult � and expensive -- one to navigate. Two years ago, we relaunched Mizer�s flagship publication, Physique Pictorial, after a 27-year hiatus. The relaunched version is clean and modern; it�s bigger, meatier, more colorful, and an homage to Mizer�s classic works interspersed with the best in images from emerging artists. The response from you, our supporters and readers, has been tremendous. Unfortunately, the cost of regularly printing such a high-quality zine has been tremendous as well. From the quality of the digest-sized paper on which we print, to the inclusion of more dazzling color, to staffing and shipping costs, we take pride in bringing Mizer into the 21st century with fresh, new photographers and artists while honoring the practices, tone, and feel of Mizer�s original Physique Pictorial, a physique culture mainstay for more than 40 years. As publishing costs continue to rise, we remain dedicated to bringing you a quarterly of which Mizer would have been proud. But in order to do that � and to insure we keep subscription and individual-volume costs steady and affordable � we need your help. A donation to help fund the continued success of Physique Pictorial will insure that Bob Mizer�s message continues to be delivered and heard, in the medium that gave him the most popularity and acclaim, and in the way he always meant it to be. Haven�t had the chance to check out Physique Pictorial? There�s no better time to start than now. Your donation will insure you get caught up on the fun. Print publishing is getting more expensive each year. Just take a look at our Physique Pictorial project by the numbers: $6,000 funds one volume $10,000 funds two volumes $25,000 funds an entire year of volumes (4) Whether it's a little or a lot, your pledge -- low or high -- is vital to the future of the Pictorial's success.

And the reason it�s moving is because others are making it. Instead of standing back and just observing, or looking with judgement, you are drawn to step up and take a turn. Try your hand. Challenge your inner fear of inclusion and exclusion to be part of the art. That is why we are making a hand reaching from the dust. Our intention with this piece, is to create art that requires participation to be complete, that thrives on communication, and the willingness to allow yourself to become part of something fun and interactive. Stop standing on the sidelines and get in there. You�ll never know unless you try, yeah it�s scary the first time, but change never comes without a challenge. The sculpture only becomes art with your participation, and the results of these interactions are unpredictable and cannot happen without everyone�s radical self inclusion.

Our bestselling flashlight and customer favorite is the feature-packed ZEROHOUR RELIC XR. Now it�s time for a sequel! Introducing ZEROHOUR RELIC XR2: Compact USB rechargeable tactical flashlight with 2,000 lumen LED, variable control ring, and waterproof USB-C portable charger all-in-one. Tactical-Grade Compact Flashlight Constructed with aircraft aluminum and achieving an incredible 2,000 lumen output with the Cree XHP35 High Intensity LED, XR2 doubles the luminosity of the original and continues ZeroHour's dedication to best-in-class design materials. Featuring an variable control ring that allows maximum flexibility in choosing brightness from 0 to 2000 lumens, plus the option to click into XR2's preset modes (10 lumens, 2000 lumens, Blink, and Strobe). USB Type-C Rechargeable Portable Charger Keep ZEROHOUR XR2 with you wherever you go for that extra boost of backup power: its Sony 3,100mAh 20A high-drain IMR battery provides at least a full charge for your smartphones and cameras. We chose USB-C for XR2 because we wanted to improve our recharge and powerbank output speed. The original XR1 featured a Micro-USB with a maximum 1A input and 1.5A output. XR2 has a 2A maximum input and output. Simply untwist the waterproof center ring for easy access to the upgraded 2 Amp USB-C port to charge your USB devices and to recharge the flashlight all from a single port. XR2 works with all USB-C devices but if you haven't switched to USB-C yet, no worries! We are throwing in a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable for backward compatibility with all your standard USB chargers, cables, and devices. Included USB-C to USB-A adapter cable Why USB Type-C? USB-C (USB Type-C) features a new, smaller connector shape that�s reversible so it�s easier to plug in. USB-C cables can carry significantly more power, so they can be used to charge larger devices. USB-C provides plenty to like. It�s reversible, so you�ll no longer have to flip the connector around a minimum of three times looking for the correct orientation. It�s a single USB connector shape that all devices will adopt in the future, so you won�t have to keep loads of different USB cables with different connector shapes for your various devices in the future. And you�ll have no more massive ports taking up an unnecessary amount of room on ever-thinner devices. It has been no small endeavor to integrate an LED this powerful with a top quality high-drain battery, and then route that power to your portable charger. Packing all this energy into the original XR�s patented design, ZEROHOUR XR2 incorporates a tail-cap switch with momentary-on click setting, anti-roll ring, removable clip, and replaceable stainless steel head bezel. Our XR2 is highly adaptable to your needs, fits standard 1� bike mounts, weapon mounts, or belt holsters, and is easy to tuck away in your backpack, purse, or pocket. We�ve returned to Kickstarter because we are still a start-up, we love the community, and we�re hoping you�ll want to help make our new flashlight as successful as our first. We come to you with experience developing many successful campaigns from start to finished product. Our amazing backer support fuels our mission to offer a full line of ZEROHOUR flashlights for your modern needs. With key feature enhancements and a beautiful, upgraded matte black finish, we believe RELIC XR2 is ready for liftoff. Whether you're indoors or outdoors, on the go or on the job, ready for adventure or just keeping safe, XR2 is the perfect choice to power and light your way. Built with the latest game-changing Cree� XLamp XHP35, a high-intensity LED that radically reduces the optical source size and power required to achieve its 2,000 lumen output. XR2 shines dangerously bright, providing plenty of confidence and security for its size and weight. Cycle through four different mode positions on ZEROHOUR XR2's innovative variable brightness control ring: Mode Overview *We apologize that the camera's auto-focus made it a bit hard to see the variable brightness mode; 0 to 2000 lumens Triple Output: Press the tail-cap half way for momentary-on at 10 lumens. Fully click for constant-on at 10 lumens. Click twice more within two seconds to jump to high (2000 lumens), click twice again for strobe. Stand-by/USB-C: From position one, turn one-click clockwise to set to stand-by. This activates the USB-C ports, which can be used to recharge XR2 or send power from the powerbank to your devices. Variable Brightness: This next setting allows you to select any desired brightness from 0 to 2000 lumens. Click the control ring clockwise from stand-by, and slowly turn to adjust brightness. *NEW MODE* Blink/Beacon: Great for hiking, biking, jogging, or to signal your location. This setting helps you be seen at night by blinking at 2000 lumens. Self-defense Strobe: The final click clockwise activates strobe, a non-lethal self-defense feature. This 2000 lumen strobe can temporarily blind an assailant, which can be followed up with a strike from the stainless steel bezel (either head or tail side) to neutralize your threat. Simply plug your device into ZEROHOUR's USB Type-C port to charge most electronic devices including mobile smartphones, MP3 players, digital cameras, portable speakers and many Bluetooth-enabled devices. USB-C Powerbank Feature You can charge practically any USB device using our supplied USB-C to USB-A adapter cable and any USB charging cable (e.g. Apple Lightning, Micro-USB, Mini-USB, etc.) Battery One 18650 High-drain 20A IMR battery provides 3,100 mAh of power (1-2 full charges) for most smart devices. Our quality, trusted brand-name battery cells are manufactured by Sony. ZEROHOUR XR2 can be used to charge any rechargeable mobile USB device. Here is a list of popular mobile devices and their battery capacities: Samsung S8+: 3500mAh iPhone X: 2716mAh HUAWEI P20: 3400mAh GoPro HERO7: 1220mAh Google Pixel: 3520mAh Sony: 3000mAh LG: 3000mAh Use trusted, brand-name, high-drain batteries only. Your flashlight will include a high-drain 18650 battery tested exclusively to maximize XR2�s flashlight functions. There are many batteries on the market that are not trustworthy and promise higher outputs for lower prices, especially on reseller marketplaces (eBay, Amazon). You have the option to use other 18650 high-drain batteries with XR2, but we highly recommend you use only the included battery or brand-name batteries purchased from ZeroHourXD.com or a trusted seller.

ZEROHOUR XR2's sleek yet rugged enclosure withstands extreme conditions, delivers emergency power to your devices with its integrated portable charger, and can be easily taken apart to change and replace components. Functional prototype parts To produce one of the most durable powerbank ashlights on the market, we enlisted a trusted overseas ashlight manufacturer who we have worked with for over eight years. They connected us with a team of engineers, and together with our designs and their experience and resources, we will produce XR2 to exact specifications. It has taken us well over 3 years since our patent application but we are excited to announce that as of March 2019 we have been granted a design patent from United States Patent & Trademarks Office. We designed and developed the first functional XR prototype 4.5 years ago. January 2015 prototype We made several design upgrades to the XR1 before delivering and they were received very well with our backers. We are confident that the XR2's design will be even better! Here are our latest vector models/drawings: CAD models: Early 2018: Research and development. Summer 2018: Finalize new working prototype. March 2019: Begin Kickstarter campaign development. May 2019: KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN GOES LIVE! July 2019: Begin ZEROHOUR XR2 production. October 2019: XR2 arrives and delivery begins! Our company launched on Kickstarter to set a new standard in flashlights. As a safety device, we wanted to build one of the best flashlights on the market.

The crew desperately adjusted sails, pulled ropes, and turned wheels � anything to try and steer the course of the ship away from the looming thick fog sitting dead ahead of them. Captain Pug calmly walked among the crew, staring at the Fog when she wasn�t barking the occasional order. Eventually, the blue sky took up more and more of the view. Noctis returned to his captain, who was still staring ahead. �Ma�am, shouldn�t you be happy? We�ve cleared the Fog.� �We have. But you�ve forgotten one thing.� At that precise moment, the water all around the ship started to boil. The acidic water splashed onto the desk, irritating the eyes and skin of all the crew as they tried to figure out what was going on. Noctis ran to the side of the ship and stuck his head into the spray, shielding his eyes to get a better look. He caught a glimpse of something dark and rubbery slithering under the water before it disappeared again. Then he heard a loud keening wail, and a giant squid-like creature lurched out of the water in front of the ship. Its tentacles waved menacingly in the air as it reared up, as large as the ship itself. Captain Pug stared calmly at the monstrosity. �You forgot the kraken, number one.� Click <HERE> to learn more about the Realms of Pugmire! The main goal of this Pirates of Pugmire Kickstarter is to enable us to create a hardcover edition of the Pirates of Pugmire book compatible with the other Realms of Pugmire core rulebooks such as Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau. We want to create an 7"" x 10"" hardcover with an evocative, action-packed cover image and a Pugmire- and Mau-inspired cover design. We estimate the book to be between 150-200 pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including further depth to the two new playable species! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores. Not Final Design. Pirates of Pugmire is a chronicle sourcebook for both Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau. It�s usable in either game, or as part of a joint experience. Some highlights include: Two new species for players to enjoy: lizards and birds Six new callings, including two for dogs and two for cats Rules for building, sailing, and sinking ships A trove of new allies, enemies, and treasures Information on Waterdog Port and Port Matthew �Going on the Account,� a chronicle of three new adventures, taking characters from 1st through 6th level Throughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Pirates of Pugmire manuscript as backer-only updates. MORE INFORMATION, INTERVIEWS, and REVIEWS To hear Eddy's complete audio Design Diary, check out the OnyxPathcast <HERE> Click below to hear an interview with Eddy about Pirates of Pugmire from The Story Told podcast team: Click to hear an interview with Eddy Webb about Pirates of Pugmire Dogs have inherited the world, building the kingdom of Pugmire untold centuries after the Ages of Man were over. These dogs have been uplifted to use tools and language, and they seek to rediscover the ruins of the Old Ones. Some have learned to use the leftover technology of humanity, but they believe it to be magic handed to them by their lost gods. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using a Code of Man compiled from ancient, fragmentary lore left behind by humanity. The world is dangerous and mysterious, but good dogs will persevere. Pugmire is a light-hearted and family-friendly fantasy world. It�s one of the first of Onyx Path�s creator-owned games, produced in a partnership with Eddy Webb and Pugsteady. Combining the ideas, passion, and creativity of experienced designers with decades of experience in producing quality roleplaying game products, these creator-owned games push the boundaries of the �Onyx Path brand� in new and diverse directions. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Pugmire roleplaying game Core Rulebook was released in 2017. The game featured a traditional fantasy rules system redesigned for streamlined play and easy creation of heroic dogs, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. Since the initial release, the Realms of Pugmire have expanded to include adventure scenarios and audio dramas, as well as a new game in the setting featuring the cat-based Monarchies of Mau. The recent introduction of Canis Minor, a community-driven digital content storefront, has further opened up the world for exploration. As noted, the primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Pirates of Pugmire that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community. Beyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the Realms of Pugmire, expanding into rules companions and other Pugmire-related tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore options and this game line. Thirdly, we want to celebrate the success of Pugmire and Mau so far by offering an opportunity to for new players to join in. We'll help backers by including a discounted selection of PDF titles � the core rulebooks, as well as a digital treasure chest containing expansions and supplements. Beyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done � open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form � and like the scenarios contained within, setting out on a brave new adventure! When you back this project, you join our crew and we explore this story together. All participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($40,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target. In thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.

To help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).

Backers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Seadog and Pressgang Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)

With this Pirates of Pugmire campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Sutler) will get 5 copies of the hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store. Several Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to have your pet act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Pirates of Pugmire book or a possible supplement.

Timeline We strive to send parcels as quickly as possible and better, so you can expect them within 1-2 weeks from the date of mailing, do not worry about the safety of the parcel, we have provided the best conditions for its transportation and storage, in some cases, the parcel may take longer due to the peculiarities of your location. We try to send everything on time and around the world. Thanks for the support! Thanks to Kickstarter and your support Wave Pen project was released and was in demand among many users of high-quality and unique products. We strive to develop our product in the future and it would not be without Kickstarter and community support. Thank you!"

I started smithing and metal work as a child and trained with a journeyman blacksmith at Jamestown Settlement and a master brass founder at Colonial Williamsburg. I have finally built a basic shop on my farm, Ravenstead. It's a simple shop reminiscent of the 17th century shop I worked in at Jamestown. Ravenstead is my home and family business with smithing becoming a bigger part of what I do to provide. This current project will help better establish the blacksmithing shop at Ravenstead. When I'm not working on the farm or smithing I'm thinking about games and gaming. I love classic tabletop role-playing games. I had a blast making my last several Kickstarter Projects, Forged Iron Protection Runes: A Tabletop RPG Token , Dragon Scales: A Tabletop RPG Game of Chance , Scrying Dice: A Tabletop RPG Runic Accessory. and Dice Vaults and Treasure Coins: Tabletop RPG Accessories I am excited to share my new project, Troll's Teeth: A Tabletop RPG Game of Chance� ! It is a combination of my two favorite things, gaming and blacksmithing. I am presenting the game in a fantasy setting here, but I already have plans to use this in a Sci-Fi Campaign taking place in an isolated back-world cantina. Troll's Teeth truly fits into any RPG! Troll's Teeth is a game of chance for use with any Role Playing Game System. The rules are straightforward and designed to favor the adventurer, inspiring excitement and fun. The game is played with six handmade iron or wooden teeth that are cast across your favorite tavern table. Place your wager, cast the teeth, then count the pips and consult the results table in the PDF rules provided. I am offering sets of wood and iron. Each set comes with a cloth drawstring bag, three hand-struck pewter coins, and a PDF copy of the rules. The wooden set features teeth made from western red cedar and has pips wood-burned into opposing facets. Each tooth roughly measures 0.5"" x 1.5"". The teeth are finished with linseed oil giving them a deep golden color. The iron set is hand-forged and filed, with pips stamped into opposing facets. Each tooth roughly measures 0.375"" x 1.5"". The teeth are lightly coated with beeswax to protect the finish and prevent tarnishing. Trolls Beware! Beware of trolls at your doorstep! The best way to protect your stronghold is to display a lock of troll's hair affixed with a forged nail. This will serve as a warning to any marauding beasts that a mighty slayer resides within! This reward includes a lock of troll's hair adorned with a copper colored plastic bead and two hand forged nails. I keep one nailed above my forge to discourage any nasty beasts from hanging around! I have plans for numerous add-ons and stretch goals for the project. If the project reaches a high enough goal I will be able to offer leather pouches, extra pewter coins, and a handcrafted Troll's Tooth necklace! Let's make this a BIG project! Here is a look at the Troll's Tooth Pendant. You can pledge for this alone or add $38 to your original pledge to receive the pendant along with your other rewards! The money I earn with this project will go towards improving my blacksmith shop and developing my Etsy Store. In terms of shop improvements, we are looking at building a larger work space here at Ravenstead. This would involve pouring a concrete slab, construction of a building, running power to the building, and the monumental task of equipping the shop with forges and other heavy equipment. It will be a long process and the first step will be site planning, surveys, and drafting of plans. If you're anything like me, you like to know the behind-the-scenes details of a project like this. I would like to share this process with you, so some of the funds from this project will go towards establishing a stronger presence on YouTube and towards developing a Patreon Page. Anything left over will go towards coal for the ever-hungry forge, and other consumables such as metal files, wire brushes, and metal stock. Shipping I will be using USPS to ship all rewards via First Class Package service. Should the shipping weight exceed 16 ounces with the purchase of extras or add-ons an additional fee may be required to cover the postage. (c) 2018 - 2019 David Savedge"

This project exists to help tackle the growing problem of one time use shopping bags while raising awareness of the mounting problem of plastic pollution. Why bags? Plastic bags are among the most common sources of marine debris and are not biodegradable, meaning each bag thrown away could potentially become a wildlife serial killer for hundreds of years. According to Waste Management only 1% of plastic bags are currently being recycled. This is because bags are really hard to recycle. Do to the nature of the bags, there aren't many companies who can actually recycle them. This is because in order to recycle bags, companies need expensive and specialized equipment. In fact, most municipalities don't have this equipment and ask their customers to keep the bags out of the recycle bin because they just end up jamming their recycling machines. There's also not enough of a financial incentive to recycle bags in the first place as plastic is extremely inexpensive and easy to produce. Workers at a Waste Management Inc. recycling facility try to detangle dozens of plastic bags stuck in the sorting equipment. The plant has to suspend operations several times a day while the workers fix the problem. A campaign for a better tomorrow Changes start small and good ideas are worth spreading. After months of trial and error, we're fortunate to have found a process of upcycling bags that produces a beautiful leather like material that is both lightweight and extremely durable. Also, the process to turn these bags into leather like material does not produce any smoke, fumes or pollution to the environment. If the campaign were to be successful, we could show the world a small solution to the growing plastic problem and spark the innovation of other entrepreneurs and activists to create solutions of their own. Why this campaign matters This minimalist wallet is made from 100% post consumer, one time use plastic shopping bags and the campaign's success shows the world that there is demand for upcycled goods. This is more than a minimalist wallet, this is proof that upcycled goods can be unique, beautiful, and perform better than mass produced products."

Generation will be done using the open-source Rainbow Crackalack code. Compared to brute-force searching, password auditing with these tables can be 19 times more efficient in terms of time and electricity usage! Several milestones for the project are set: 10% coverage of the entire keyspace. 25% coverage of the entire keyspace. 50% coverage of the entire keyspace. The first and second milestones (10% & 25% coverage) are guaranteed to succeed even without any funding. However, 50% coverage can only be attained with the purchase of additional GPU (& support) hardware. Along with electrical costs to power the equipment, this is where all project funds will go towards. It should be noted that even 10% coverage can be extremely useful in some real-world scenarios. For example, if NTLM hashes for 20 high-privilege accounts were obtained, cracking with this limited set would yield two plaintext passwords on average. And as any experienced penetration tester would confirm, all that's really needed is one cracked hash... Ideally, 95%+ coverage is desirable, but experimentation with 8-character NTLM tables showed that pushing past 70% is problematic. Namely, the efficiency of raw tables begins to drop very significantly; in the 80% range, 1 TB of raw tables yields only 37 GB of processed and usable data (only 4% efficiency!). Given that the 9-character keyspace is 95 times larger than the 8-character keyspace, this implies that roughly over 150 TB would be needed, which would take many years to generate with the project's existing hardware, along with many thousands of dollars in electricity costs. We will attempt to crowd-source free help from the community regardless. Every $3,000 the project raises, a new 6 x NVIDIA RTX 2060 machine can be purchased and operated for six months (hydro-electric power is cheaply sourced from Niagara Falls). At least one new machine is needed. If over $10,000 is raised, additional machines based on the NVIDIA RTX 2070, 2070 Ti, 2080, and/or 2080 Ti will be built. This is estimated to yield results in the 65% range in 5-6 months. Funding up to $100,000 can be effectively used; reaching this limit would make 99% coverage of all 9-character NTLM passwords nearly guaranteed! No matter the outcome, all tables will be made publicly available for free via BitTorrent on the project website (https://www.rainbowcrackalack.com/). Hard drives pre-loaded with the tables can be purchased for convenience/sponsorship. Together, we can Make Rainbow Tables Great Again!"

The creek originates southwest of Petersville before curving its way 99 miles across the county to its confluence with the Ohio River in Garrison. The miles are filled with fishing, waterfalls, swimming holes, rock formations and more. As far as I know, there as never been a extensive book with photos covering this amazing natural resource that we are lucky enough to call our own! I have the equipment (the computer, software) and the expertise to put such a book together and I am excited about this possibility. I plan to gather more research about the beginning and the end; attain land owners permission when needed; include as much as possible about the creek in regards to the name and its origin and take advantage of the seasons. Since I manage my own business also, I am expecting this project to take from 6 months to a year. I am hoping the final product will lead to an awareness about this local attraction. There has been a lot of talk about kayaking/canoe shops, camping features and other possible ways of increasing tourism. We don't have a great deal of industry in our area but we do have the water and the hills- which in my opinion, make us quite spectacular!"

I am an elementary school teacher, a playwright and the founder of Imaginary Theater Company. Our mission is to produce original plays that empower children to be the heroes of their own stories. Since our inception in 2015, we have produced 5 original plays in New Haven, CT as well as a podcast. Three of our plays have been published by Drama Notebook. We�ve had children and adult actors take their first bows on stage alongside professional actors heading out on national tours. Participation in our productions is free. Our plays are inspired by real challenges children face and the heart, smarts and imagination they use to face them. Growing up, doing summer theater changed my life. I looked forward to it every year. It is where I found my voice and my community. Many of the people I met performing in plays are still my closest friends today. As an educator I have seen how acting helps students build skills they use onstage and off, including public speaking, teamwork, literacy and empathy. By supporting this project you are fueling the passions of a new generation of theater makers and creating lifelong memories for us all. With Love & Gratitude, Starry The 2018 cast of ""Canary, Cockroach, Phoenix"" About the Play �The Boat� is near and dear to our hearts because it was the first play Imaginary Theater Company ever produced. That first production featured three adult actors and a very talented first grader named Aija making her theatrical debut. (We are thrilled that Aija will be returning to the stage with us this summer along with her younger sister, Alana!) To celebrate our 5th anniversary, and our final summer in New Haven, we are mounting an expanded, revamped version of �The Boat� with more roles to incorporate the children who have joined our company over the years. Our new version of �The Boat� follows the story of two young girls, Marina and Ida, whose mother has disappeared at sea. Everyone, including Marina, believes their mother has drowned. But Ida believes her mother has become a mermaid. Through music, poetry and whimsy �The Boat� tells a tale of grief, healing and resilience.

Each new illustration has been a discovery of what I'm capable of and love to do. It's been an enriching experience, and I'm thrilled to be here in my kitchen typing this introduction just days before it finally goes public. I chose the story of the ""The Little Mermaid"" because it was the perfect match for my fondness of dark fantasy, romance, and drawing flowing organic shapes. Mermaids are truly wonderfully fun to draw, and I can't get enough drawing of glorious long hair. It's a simple thing, but I love it. How does it differ from the original 1830s version by H.C. Andersen? I've mostly just updated the grammar so it reads more easily, plus I have added a few of my own ideas. For example, our mermaids have glowing bioluminescent hair to help them navigate in the dark depths of the sea. They have eyes, gills, and skin like a ghost shark. Our little mermaid has a treasured skull collection of all types of creatures that have floated down from the world above. Bird skulls mostly, but there are a few human bones from the poor sailors lost at sea. She has three loving siblings, two sisters and a brother, who watch her grow with pride, and marvel at her talent in singing and dancing. --------- � --------- � --------- � --------- --------- � --------- � --------- � --------- � ------- I bring you an adaption of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid. The little mermaid has always yearned for the strange and exciting life of the humans. After saving a human man during a sea storm, she desired his love and to have a life with him. And if they were married, his soul would be shared with her. For mermaid have no souls, and merely return to the ocean as sea foam when they die. Naive and desperate, the little mermaid turned to the banished sea witch among the world pools. The exchange to be human was high. To walk on two legs, she had to offer-up her tongue, and with new feet every step would feel as if she were walking on daggers. Unless the man chooses her as his wife, the spell would break and she would die. Scared, but determined, the little mermaid accepts the sea witch's terms and begins her journey to find love and a soul. --------- � --------- � --------- � --------- --------- � --------- � --------- � --------- � ------- A 60-page signed 6x9 hardcover book with a gold foil stamped cloth cover and spine.

I was able to experience different cultures firsthand and share it, via my film ""Wayfaring"", to whomever would watch. When I heard a few years ago that some folks had put together a route in Ireland of a similar nature, I knew that I would probably one day want to do it. Well, that day is now! (Best time to hike is usually starting in late June through August). What I also found appealing is that this would be the first trail that I would attempt to make a film of that's, essentially, still in its infancy. The Pacific Crest Trail, Appalachian Trail, the Camino and the 3 trails I hiked in Australia were well-established. Plus, as far as I know, no one has put together a full-length documentary about the Ireland Way as of yet. So the challenge of putting something together that's hopefully informative, entertaining and inspiring truly rocks my boat. The trail should take about 40-45 days to hike (it's roughly 600 miles long). The money would go towards food, some lodging (more camping along the route than the Camino but not as much as the PCT or AT) and a small rent-a-car to be used for about a week to drive around and get b-roll footage via my handheld and a drone that my ever-lovely girlfriend would bring over and lug back. God bless her. I plan to be on the Emerald Isle for a total of 60 days. Hope you partake! Thanks, Scott (Squatch)"

Here at Dapper, we have designed what we are calling the World's Strongest Motorcycle Hoodie! We've taken some of the best abrasive resistant technology out there and married it to your normal everyday hoodie. We use a 4 layer system we've called MAR which stands for a Multi-Layer Abrasion Resistance. On the most outer layer (1), it features a 100% soft spun cotton that is soft, breathable, and most important of all, comfortable. Next (2) is a layer of aramid woven fiber that is designed to protect you against cuts, scratches, and road rash abrasion. (3) Third is CE rated shoulder and elbow armor with a spine protector that protects against impact. It's held in by (4) a mesh inner lining that holds all the layers together while allowing airflow and breath-ability during all riding conditions. What? Being avid motorcycle riders, our founder recently caught himself riding in hoodies rather than full gear during short trips and in summer weather. So the thought occurred, how could we build a protective hoodie to make causal riding safer? We had two goals in mind: 1. Can I go to dinner without anyone realizing this is a fully armored abrasive resistant hoodie? 2. Could the hoodie withstand a 60mph crash? How? We took this hoodie design to a few manufacturers that specialized in motorsport and casual apparel and partnered up. We went through about 5 prototypes and tested each one along the way trying to figure out the right amount of aramid fiber (yes, the same material in bulletproof armor), pad location, preventatives against ride up (when your shirt/hoodie rides up during a crash exposing your skin). We developed a few different mechanisms including a belt loop latch and thumb catch. But the ultimate test was how it fared in a crash. We originally were skeptical that this was going to work. Crash During a meeting, we asked ""Anyone want to lay a bike down?"" No hands went up. ""Anyone want to get dragged down the street?"" Silence. No eye contact. It's funny how we love to race cars, ride motorcycles, and be dare devils but when it comes down to it, no one wanted to risk their butt on a product we didn't know worked. Instead, we decided to take Josh, our 100lb body weight, and drag it down our street. One Saturday morning, we zipped up the hoodie, strapped Josh with a tie down and started driving down our street. The first pull was about 60MPH where we dragged him about 500ft. We hopped out of the truck and looked at him. ""Wait what?... nothing happened?"" There was a little bit of wear on the cotton but really nothing had happened. So we did it again... and again... and again. 5 times at 60MPH back and fourth on the 500ft stretch of road until we broke through the layers. On the 5th time, the aramid fiber layer finally gave and wore through the fibers. We plan on testing this with a stuntman in late 2019. Why Kickstarter? We've always been a small company employing local people and trying to do as much as we can domestically. We design all our products as users of the products. Almost all of our staff are licensed motorcycle riders looking to solve the simple problems we look over. A downside to this method is slow production, higher cost, and slower development. With a successful Kickstarter campaign, we will release the Gen 4 hoodie. The Gen 4 Hoodie includes revised armor placement, additional high strength velcro to adjust the armor placement higher and lower down your shoulder/elbow, and a new drooping rear to give you additional protection lower down your back. Additional changes include a new logo, labeling and a revised sizing chart. Revised Gen 4 Sizing Chart Goal At the end of the day, our goal is to move beyond motorcycles and create a new category of apparel ""Protective Casual"". Whether you're out gardening, underneath a car, or hands on at work, we want to reinforce your apparel. With materials and technology that can reduce injuries and material wear, you'll be protected. With DFNDR, ""Stay Strong and Be Strong."""

This is my 2nd Kickstarter Campaign (my first being an Eeveelution Acrylic Charm set), but my first running one for Enamel Pins. I've self-funded my first 8 designs over the past 4 months, but need your help to bring this specific collection to life! This series is a fun idea I've been playing with for a few months now, and focuses on the ""evil"" Organizations from each region of the Pokemon universe, and their most commonly-used Pokemon dressed as their mascots! I've designed 7 Pins in total, as well as 1 Freebie Stretchgoal! Please check out all the designs below, and if you favor any of them, remember that pledging now helps unlock all the designs sooner! Our main goal for this campaign is the Poochyena duo for Team Aqua and Team Magma of the Hoenn Region! I chose Poochyena as the Mascot for these teams as both teams use this common puppy Pokemon, even if they disagree in the whole land versus sea thing. Our first round of Stretchgoals are for Team Rocket Meowth - for reasons that I feel should be obvious to all Pokemon fans - from the Kanto Region and Team Skull Alola Rattata from the Alola Region! Not only is Rattata a common Pokemon used by the Team Skull Grunts, but he seemed the perfect choice to pull off one of Team Skulls more ridiculous, yet iconic, poses~ Stretchgoal wave 2 starts with Team Flare Scraggy from the Kalos Region! Scraggy is the only Pokemon chosen in this campaign that doesn't hail from his teams home Region, but he was a very common Pokemon used by the Grunts in the gang, and he pulls off their pose quite well! The second part of this wave is a FREEBIE Stretchgoal to all backers of 1 pin or more: Giovanni Persian! I couldn't resist sketching up Persian dressed in Giovanni's iconic orange suit, and decided to do his more classic Team Rocket suit as well and turn it into a double-sided clear Acrylic charm! Our 3rd and final wave of Strecthgoals starts Team Plasma Purrloin from the Unova Region! Team Plasma actually has 2 very different uniforms depending on which version of Black/White you played, but I felt the Militia Uniform from B2/W2 suited Purrloin best. And finally we end on Team Galactic Croagunk from the beloved Sinnoh region! There were a few decent choices for Grunt-used Pokemon, but when compared to Plasma's ridiculous outfits and hair... the only true choice was one confused Croagunk! All backers will get a specific number of 2-3in Vinyl Stickers based on their reward level. The sticker designs matching your chosen Pin(s) backed for when you fill out your surveys! There are very limited Reward tiers involving Plushies! The 3 choices are based on the first 3 Pokemon in the Campaign; Poochyena, Rattata and Meowth! These typically measure roughly 10-12in in length. If you back for one of these options, at the end of the campaign you will have the choice of coloring (normal or shiny). For Rattata backers, you can choose not only coloring, but if you'd prefer Alola Rattata versus Kanto Rattata, and Meowth backers can choose to have Meowth with the awake versus sleeping faces! ADD-ON Pins; For any Early-Bird Tiers or Plushie Tiers, if you'd like to add on extra Pins simply add +$12USD to your over-all pledge per pin added. This is restricted to the Pins in this Campaign only, NOT the pins in my store. If you're interested in any of my store items, please message me :) Rough Timeline: JUNE - Kickstarter Begins, runs for 21 days JULY - Kickstarter Ends and Funds are transferred (2-3 week process) AUGUST - Funds are received and Production begins SEPTEMBER - By the end of Sept, all the Pins should be completed and shipped to me. Quality checking will take place. October - Backers begin receiving their rewards! This is a very rough, and generous timeline. Things could progress and finish much faster than October, or they could go right as planned above - but it's better to over-plan, than fall short! Some of my other manufactured Pins;"

Seriously, a goofy video of you, mixed with a pink banana card? It can't get better than that. Seems complicated? Don't worry, it's not. Really - it takes seconds to get a Greeto card all ready to go. Look below for some more detailed instructions! Does it make more sense? Awesome!

At the end of the campaign, you will have an option to pick any of the designs for your Greeto� card through a reward survey! Design #1 - Banana: This is a funny, yet sarcastic, birthday card that is bound to give your friend a laugh! With bright colors on the front, it will stand out in any pile of greeting cards. Design #2 - License Plate: This is a sincere thank you card that ought to make your friend feel extra special. The sophisticated artwork on the front instantly draws attention! Design #3 - You're Alright: This is another sarcastic card that can be used for a variety of occasions - from a birthday to a congratulations card. If you aren't sure which design to get - this is your best bet! *LOCKED* Design #4 - No Big Deal: A bold way to wish someone a happy birthday. This card uses contrasting colors on the front to draw attention to the subtle puns. --- Looking for a larger variety? Don't worry, the number of designs is not set in stone! As long as the campaign continues to grow, we will keep adding more and more new, awesome card designs - seriously, tons of stuff is in the works. Excited to see what you will receive? Don't worry - we get it. Above is a quick gif of what a typical package might look like; with a tiny exception. The Greeto� card, as well as the white envelope, will be packaged in a transparent bag that will preserve the card during shipment (we excluded the bag simply because it did not show up on camera)! Awesome news! In addition to your Greeto� card(s), you will also find a unique card from our team that highlights your supporter number and shows that you were one of our early adopters. Please note that due to the way we process pledges, your supporter number does not necessarily correlate to your backer number! Our production facilities as well as the Greeto� cards themselves follow the best practices for recyclability. Our planet becomes a little bit greener each time a card is made. Glitter, foil, metallic inks, adornments (ribbons, etc.), and photo paper being used in greeting cards result in at least half of all greeting cards being thrown away into landfills (RecycleByCity). We kept the cards simple, using 100% recycled paper stock that can be disposed of with ease! We encourage you, and the recipient of the card, to put it in any recycling bin once it has served its purpose! Are we a small team? Oh yeah. Yet, our dream of making the next big thing in the greeting card industry is not even close to ""small"". The story of Greeto began in the summer of 2018. Walking through the aisles of the local department store looking for a perfect birthday card, nothing seemed to work. Either the designs were boring or the inside of the card limited what could be said. Plus, writing long messages just gets annoying! Just a few days later, the idea of a QR-powered greeting card was born. A while later, Caroline and Ally were invited to be a part of the team because the first designs made by Paul were just really, really awful... Now, it has only been a few months and we have already successfully funded and shipped out our first batch of designs! This time, we are ready to make it bigger, better, and more colorful. Shipping price info: All domestic shipping is free. There's no catch! World-wide shipping is available. During the Kickstarter project, we will be offering discounted shipping anywhere on Earth! Shipping details: Orders for < 10 Greeto� cards: Your reward will be delivered in a large flat envelope (9"" x 12""). Sadly, to minimize costs, we are not able to provide a tracking number. However, upon request, we will provide a confirmation image of your flat envelope being shipped out! Orders for > 10 Greeto� cards: Your reward will be delivered in a large bubble mailer (6"" x 9""). Upon request, we will be able to provide you with your tracking number! Returns & refunds: Supporting a crowdfunding campaign can often be a risky business. What if the creator doesn't follow through? What if the product doesn't function? Well, we want to give you a peace of mind. Your Greeto� card is eligible for a full refund within 14 days of you receiving the card. It's quite simple, really. If your card is deformed, misprinted, or simply torn, we will send you your money back - no questions asked. You do not have to ship the card back to us - all that's required is a photo for proof! Here's the best part. You will be kept in the loop - constantly. Every time we hit one of the landmark points in production, an update will be sent out to all backers! Furthermore, if you have any questions or concerns during this process - we are always available to chat through email: contact@getgreeto.com. Want to chat through our contact form instead? You can find it here! What we have here is a greeting card that uses QR technology to make sure your card stands out from the crowd. We make your gift awesome. So, what? Moving forward, beyond greeting cards, we will be working together will smaller stores in the Pacific Northwest to cumulatively reduce the number of greeting cards sold with glitter, foil, and other non-recyclable materials. Jointly, we hope to reduce the number of cards that go to landfills - quickly and efficiently."

And when I picked up my first guitar at the age of twenty, it was like coming home. All i had to do was listen. In the years since, I find that music has taken up residence at the very core of my soul. Everyday, I�m blown away by it�s power to spread love and healing. The early years of my career were spent busking in coffee shops, bars, and restuarants where graciously I was given the opportunity to hone my craft. I had the blessing of working with so many kind strangers along the way, many of whom are dear friends today. Music has been there for me when simple words could not suffice and I thank God for it. It�s been there through my joy, sorrow, confusion and clarity. And it�s my hope that I can provide to others what the Creator of music has so generously gifted me - a place to feel understood. Come with an open mind. Listen with an open heart.

I've been making music and performing since I was a child, and in my house, it seemed like destiny to create sounds and songs. Photo by my mom Photo by Sierra Steen In the summer of 2017, I wrote, recorded, produced, and released an EP using a Zoom H2 digital recorder, Logic Pro X, and a lot of research. I digitized cassette tapes with audio recordings from my childhood, and integrated those recordings into songs about love, family, and figuring out my place in the world. That EP is called We Were Well, and you can listen to it here. What I'm making I've spent the past two years writing and recording new music. I narrowed down my list of material and chose the 10 songs that best capture my life as it currently stands. My 23rd and 24th years have have been defined by new experiences, loss, self-doubt, and a whole lot of joy. Each song is different from the others, yet they fit together beautifully into a continuum. I've had a blast performing them at my shows recently in Minneapolis. Photo by Sierra Steen My debut album will be called ""Spirals."" This project is already very much off the ground, as the songs have already been written, recorded, produced, and mixed! And let me tell you, these songs sound good. Myself, Mason Meyers, and Patrick Cunningham recorded my parts at the Institute of Production and Recording in downtown Minneapolis using top-of-the-line equipment. All of the other instruments were recorded in various locations in Iowa by Patrick, one of the most musically intuitive people I've ever known. He arranged all of the music, including the songs that feature string quartet. Here is a rundown of all of the musicians/artists who have already contributed their passion and talents to ""Spirals"": Patrick Cunningham - percussion, piano, producer (3 P's for Patrick!) Patrick Mason Meyers - recording engineer Rishi Kolusu - trumpet, voice Clayton Ryan - electric and upright bass Clayton Ryan, bassist extraordinaire Abigail Moore - violin and viola Kelsey Chidley - cello Abram Miller - tenor saxophone Andrey Floryanovich - clarinet Jason Andriano - trombone Chris Hansen - pedal steel guitar Kevin Bohenke - electric guitar, trumpet Kevin Bohenke, guitar and trumpet man David Meyers - electric guitar Helen Teague - cover art Holy collaborators, Batman! Patrick, a man of many talents, also produced the songs, adding his very distinctive style and musical ideas with grace. He, myself, and Mason edited and mixed the songs at IPR to get just the right balance of all these sounds. Pat at the board Photo from studio recording So, what's next? Now comes the fun part, and the part where I will need your help! The next steps in the process are mastering, CD manufacture, and album distribution (to get it up on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) My mastering engineer will be Greg Rierson at Rare Form Mastering in Minneapolis, who has mastered songs for Prince, The Cure, and Sufjan Stevens. Copycats Media in Minneapolis will manufacture the CDs. What you can get by contributing When you pre-order the album on Kickstarter, there are plenty of cool do-dads that you can collect! Such as... The Album The first thing you'll get by contributing is the album! Either a digital download, CD, or both. The songs sound lovely, and the cover art was done by the wonderful Helen Teague. The Discography In addition to the new music, if you haven't gotten a chance to get your hands/ears on my previous work, you can get that, too. I'm very proud of We Were Well and would love to give you a copy. :) The Lyric Book This just might be my favorite reward. Only 10 people can claim a handwritten book of all of the lyrics for the new songs. Each copy will be made-to-order, so your copy will be unique from all others! My mom gets one of these for free. The Custom Cover Tell me your 3 favorite songs in the whole world. I'll pick one, and record an acoustic cover and a video, just for you! I'm sure we have similar taste.

Each pin: is hard enamel is 1.5 inches tall has silver colored plating had two posts/clutches Why did I make these designs? The first pet I ever had (that was not a family pet) was a little goldfish that I won at a school fair. I was so happy bringing him home in his little plastic bag! That iconic memory was the inspiration for this pin collection. For those of you who were wondering, I named him Valentine and he lived a good seven years after that. He helped foster my love of all animals, not just the furry ones. Please understand that as an adult I am not in favor of living creatures being used as prizes, nor am I advocating for people to go out and bag animals from the wild. I wanted to join my warm memory with my love of so many different aquatic creatures and create these whimsical pin designs. I was a little concerned about the level of detail in these pins, so I had some samples made of the octopus and they turned out beautifully! About Frost Dragon Designs, LLC My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers. I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives. Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!"

My passion for music and urge to grow as a musician has been a driving force in my live. It has turned me into a modern day nomad and led me from my home town in Spain, via The Netherlands, where I've studied and lived for 8 years, to living in New York City, as a jazz musician one of my life time dreams. My album 'New York Minute' will be my first official album as a bandleader. Here you can find more information about me: www.furmigomez.com Furmi Gomez NEW YORK MINUTE New York Minute is inspired by the accelerated daily life in NYC, it�s not only a jazz album, it tells a story, a story of the city and it's people. Alongside the songs, you will find several interludes with New Yorkers conversations and sounds of the city, guiding you through a musical journey. Cover design of 'New York Minute' I composed each song during a period where I challenged myself to write one composition per week. the whole album is recorded within 2 hours, 1 or 2 takes per song. This way it delivers the instinctive and natural energy that I wanted for his Album; intuitive and fresh music. All the interludes are short improvisations, spontaneously done. I only decided the key and the tempo before recording. To make it even more spontaneous, the trio didn't play together before, in fact, not even rehearsed together before the recording session, so yes it is quite a fresh recording session we could say� All this would not have been possible without the great collaboration of the two amazing musicians playing on my records: Jongkuk Kim on drums and Ben Rolston on Bass. Jongkuk Kim Ben Rolston FINE ART & POETRY In collaboration with other New York artists, visual artist Dionne and poet L Marie Cook it became a complete all round project. L Marie Cook wrote and recited the poem Hypatia, as an addition to my song Dear Hypatia. Inspired by the story of Hypatia, a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, she lived in and worked in a male dominated Alexandria (Egypt), in the 4th century AD. Dionne made the painting for the album adding her own vision of the city where she also resides and the ""New York Minute"" concept. The Painting Dionne, visual artist L. Marie Cook, poet PRODUCTS To realize this album, I've started this Kickstarter campaign, offering a large variety of beautiful products you can buy to help reach the goal. Ranging from a digital version of the album to the original painting, made by Dionne. As an exception for this project, Dionne also offers HQ prints of the New York Minute painting, oil painting in commission. ...!!??!!??

Book, Music, Lyrics, & Training Programs written by Anna Westbrook Album Summary: This 11-track album tells the story of a 16 year old girl named Isabel who runs away from home and finds herself trapped on a magical train full of people who won't stop running. Isabel is the only person on board who remembers her own name and it is up to her to stop the train and save the other passengers (including a Porter, several Choir Members, and a mysterious Writer who may or may not be dead). However, the relationships between Isabel, the passengers and the evil Conductor turns out to be much more complicated than she originally thought. She soon discovers that in order to get off the train, she will have to take a hard look in the mirror and lean on her family to process an unaddressed history of trauma. Learn to discuss sexual maltreatment, invest in your own mental health, and support #metoo survivors by pre-ordering this full album and experiencing Isabel's musical journey. Learn more about our plans for the album with our Full Crowdfund Summary [5 page pdf]. Listening Party Summary: Our Community Listening Party will be hosted by Armstrong Community Music School on September 8th from 2 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. This will be a flexible timeline event with three interactive listing stations, culminating in a live performance of a selection of songs from the album. The experience will be curated by local producer, composer and playwright Anna Westbrook with assistance from key Isabel team members, including audio product manager Jajuan Sanabria. Local wellness professional Junice Rockman (Clinical Psychotherapist, M.A. LPC-Intern) will be present at the listening party to help support audience members during our guided listening activities and to facilitate a group discussion during the live performance that will close out the event. ""Friend of Survivor"" Video Training: Most people know someone who has experienced sexual maltreatment. However, they may not know that they know someone who has experienced this, and if they do, they may not know what to say to support them. Our pre-recorded Friend of a Survivor webinar will help you understand how to use the Isabel music to address that issue and support survivors. CEO and Isabel Lead Trainer Anna Westbrook will guide you through why she wrote each song and how you can help your friends heal by sharing the music with them in thoughtful ways.

One Color Set contains 18 total pieces: 8 Pawn figures, 2 Rook Figures, 2 Knight Figures, 2 Bishop Figures, 2 Queen Figures, and 2 King Figures. In other words, one Color Set is equal to one half of a chess set's figures (with one extra King and Queen). You'll want at least two Color Sets in different colors if your goal is to use these pieces as chess pieces. For this reason, Color Sets come in pairs for each reward tier. Single Color Sets can be added to a pledge as an add-on. The reason for Color Sets as the building-block for each reward tier rather than just full chess sets is simple. We recognize some backers will just want black and white sets of figures. However, we also recognize that other backers may just want a lot of a single color for incorporating into their own creations.

Decade after decade these artists evolved, bringing fresh new trends and sounds. Sadly, due to the lost genre and fragile record keeping of the past, many works of fabulous artists are being lost to time. Today a fresh group of musicians is helping to restore and catalog many of the hits and unique music styles of a lost generation. The goal is to educate through performance, recording and discussion to keep rare Jazz music alive � to inspire new audiences of musicians with restored sounds from our great American Jazz history. Enter Michael Persico. Mike has been a music educator and band leader for over 30 years. He has collaborated with many artists and focused on Jazz music from the Great American Songbook. In addition, Mike works with Jack Bradley, Louis Armstrong�s personal photographer and friend, archiving and cataloging over thirty thousand images of the American Jazz scene as seen through Jack�s lens. Jack had the incredible opportunity to witness some of the most prolific Jazz artists of their generation play in hundreds of venues. It occurred to Mike that these images would be the perfect backdrop to a live show that featured songs from some amazing period Jazz musicians. Jack Bradley with Louis Armstrong THE PLAN The overall idea is to create a Historical Jazz Performance Series that will tour colleges and universities throughout the United States, performing lost and unique Jazz music from the Great American Songbook to an audience of new musicians. These musical performances will include narration with Jack Bradley�s Jazz Visions historical photographs as a backdrop, and end with a music education question/answer storytelling segment with the band. Music selections will cover artists from 1900 to the 1960�s and showcase songs that have not been heard in decades, exploring the artist�s inspiration and roots. Persico and his band will record and create a music video album (DVD) to accompany the tour, which brings us to this campaign. Michael Persico Classic Jazz and Swing Orchestra and Jack Bradley's Jazz Visions THE CAMPAIGN This Kickstarter campaign will be used to produce and record a music video album that will feature many of the unique songs that will be performed in the Historical Jazz Concert Series. The album will include a running visual backdrop of Jack Bradley's Jazz Visions treasured photography that chronicles decades of Jazz behind each song. We will be recording eight new tracks in studio with our eight-piece band of musicians, that in combination with four completed tracks, will be a total of twelve for the album. The $10K raised will cover the cost of renting the studio, paying the musicians, paying the engineers, and covering most of the cost of physical production of the album. We will raise additional money through other means for promotion of the Historical Jazz Concert Series tour, the album, and pay for design/artwork. TRACKS 1.

Image from the Gradience Kickstarter launch The beginning The Gradience founders We are three queer friends (Joylyn, Rachel, and Cody) who met in design school and bonded over our mutual queerness and love for outside-of-the-box design. The three of us were at our favorite local bar one night and began talking about how different our experiences as queer people had been and continue to be. Yet it seemed to us there was a certain perception of a singular queer experience in the world. We decided we wanted to create something that could foster conversation about the nuances of unique, individual queer identities and the stories at their intersections. That is how Gradience was born. We realized we could combine our love of design and storytelling to a make a special new publication that not only fostered nuanced conversations within its pages but could support physical spaces and people that lead these conversations every day. Gradience (n): the absence of a clear-cut boundary between one category and another. The Magazine Gradience will center around queer stories, voices, and artists. It will be inclusive of all identities, and promises to feature not only captivating written stories and interviews, but incredible art and expression from the queer community. Each issue will tell nuanced stories around a single topic. The first issue of Gradience will center around the topic of Coming Out. It tells the stories of transitioning, coming out to oneself, family, religion, and much more. Magazine Spread A Partnership � Seattle's LGBTQ Center For Issue one, we're partnering with Seattle's LGBTQ center Gay City in support of their mission to promote wellness in LGBTQ communities by providing health services, connecting people to resources, fostering arts, and building community. Proceeds from issues of Gradience sold will ultimately support Gay City's mission and the beautiful community that inform and allow Gradience to exist. Why Print? We feel print is the most intimate form of media which would reflect the nature of our magazine's content: deeply personal stories, images, and art. Additionally, as designers, we cherish the challenges of print work and love that it can be shared and passed down from one person to another. Cody reading a Gradience article during the Kickstarter launch We need your help In order to create and share the beautiful content in this magazine, we need help with its cost of production. We want to make a high quality product that you can hold on to and feel proud to own for a long time. This costs money to do.

Our first pick is a video game called Switchblade. Switchblade was a game originally developed by Core Design (Tomb Raider, Rick Dangerous, Wolfchild, etc), and published by Gremlin Interactive (Top Gear, Body Harvest, Zool). With this Kickstarter, we will launch a new brand called ""Toyetico"" that will be the pin point for toy merchandise based on video games Piko Interactive has the rights to. Switchblade 1989 Amiga Cover Art Switchblade Game Backstory On the cyber world of Thraxx, Havok has returned. After 10.000 years of peace, the Fireblade, source of power for the ancient Bladeknights, has shattered. The night burned red, and the people of the Undercity fell beneath the onslaught of Havok's nightmare creations. Helpless, the Bladeknights died alongside their people. Only one of their order survived. You play Hiro, the last of the Bladeknights, a hi-tech warrior armed with stealth, cunning and a powerful re-programmable cyber-arm. You must enter the Undercity and reassemble the sixteen fragments of the shattered Fireblade. Only then will you be able to take on Havok and average the death of your people. Switchblade Gameplay Screenshots Switchblade Characters and Enemies (Original Concept art from 1989) Enemies Concept Art Circa 1989 Producing Brand Toyetico will be a subsidiary that will concentrate producing fun and exciting toys based on video game properties owned by Piko Interactive. Toyetico logo State of the Project Currently we have already designed and produced a prototype of the action figure. We just need to make the order to open a tooling and start the production run. It would take 3-5 months to finish the tooling, produce the figures, and get them to our door. We need to produce at least 1000 units of the same figure as the factory has placed that minimum quantity. This is why we have come to Kickstarter. At this time, we only need 8,000 USD to get the mold ready and finish the first production run. One of the main reasons why we are doing this is because we believe there is a great lack of indie toy makers. Indie video games is now a great part of the video game industry, but toys has stayed behind in terms of indie productions. We hope this project is appealing enough to collectors and action figure enthusiasts as our selves, to get it funded and kickstart a long line of indie action figures based on beloved retro video game characters. How to Make an Action Figure The process to develop an action figure is quite straight forward: We design the character's action figure in 2D drawing> Reproduce the 2D Drawing into a 3D Render> Sculpture produces prototype based on 3D Render (we are here)> Use approved prototype to produce final mold > Mold is ready for production and production starts! Hiro 2D action Figure Design. Hiro Figure 3D Render Hiro Figure 3D Assembling Render We have also prepared other figures based on Switchblade's characters. These are Hiro's Enemies that you encounter during the game. Here is a 2D design of ManSnake/Cybersnake. Mansnake A.K.A. Cybersnake. For this particular figure, we have picked a body style that resembles the Marvel action figures of the 80s and 90s. There are 3 popular action figure lines that have impacted our lives through our childhood memories. They are Toybiz's Marvel figures ,Playmates' Ninja Turtles, and Hasbro's 3.75"" GI. Joe. We will base our line's designs on these body types and figure styles. Toybiz body type comparison. Extra Goodies and Stretch Goals We have also developed retro video game version of Switchblade, based on the Amiga port. These will be available as rewards for those that want the whole old school toys experience. Switchblade Atari Jaguar Switchblade Sega Genesis Stretch Goals If we reach 25,000 we will produce ManSnake's figure If we reach 45,000 we will produce Cresthed's Figure If we reach 63,000 we will produce Reptilon's Figure If we reach 80,000 we will produce Flamehog's Figure If we reach 100,000 we will produce an unreleased enemy figure (picked by the backers as there are a few). If we reach 140,000 we will produce a Tiger electronic's style handheld for the Switchblade Video Game. Stretch Goals If Stretch Goals are met, new items produced will be available separately. However backers who pick rewards that include multiple copies of figures will be able to pick figures from the rewards met. Video background by Visualdon"

Forrest Bower here, Seven years ago, in my tiny apartment with my crummy laptop, I started Bower's Game Corner, a hobby game review channel on YouTube. Since then I have recruited Eric Baca to work the behind-the-scenes action and we have now released well over a thousand videos reviewing, and covering old games, new games, classics, stinkers and everything in between. We release a new review every day or two in addition to Learn to Plays, Kickstarter game re/previews, game plays, Top 10 lists, and the occasional vlog. Last year we successfully completed a similar project to shoot over 130 unique videos centered around our time at Gen con 2018. We filmed previews, full-length game sessions, first impressions of new releases, Top 10 lists, events, one-on-one interviews, and daily recaps. During the five days we walked, talked, filmed, edited, and posted videos and, most importantly, played games. It was an amazing experience that was both rewarding and exhausting. Gen Con is the longest-running, best-attended gaming convention in the world and we are hoping to once again bring the excitement of the convention to those of you won't be among the 70,000+ people in attendance. WHAT WE WANT TO DO Our ultimate goal is to bring over 132 pieces of Gen Con related content to your lovely eye holes! We don't plan on seeing this being a problem as we have done this the last 4 years. One again this year we are doing a lightning quick format which should get the videos to you super fast. Last year we posted over 90 videos while at Gen Con! We plan to do this by bringing on a third person again to help streamline our production process and upgrading our recording capacity, and equipment. We will be shooting pre- and post- convention Top Ten lists, previews of new releases, full-length game plays, interviews with game designers and artists, impression videos, Gen Con After Dark tours, and much more!

If pledges go above that, the more the better! The Great Express Robbery (1907) crime pulp novel. This crowdfunder is to get a 102 year old pulp crime paperback back into print. The Great Express Robbery (1907) by Grace Miller White is based upon the play by A. H. Woods. It's protagonists are two young women who live near their father's coal mine somewhere outside of Old San Francisco and they deal with rough outlaws. Including a husband with bad intentions for everyone! The setting is barely more than a decade after of The Old West era (1865-1895)! And as you can figure from looking at the cover, train robbery is involved! Hello! My name is Darren Nemeth and I published two other books. How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, which was funded here successfully in early 2018, and 1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition (printed in 2015). Both are about early motion pictures and filled with carefully retouched ephemera, some are very similar in printing as The Great Express Robbery. I found The Great Express Robbery a few months ago and never saw a pulp novel going back that far in person. Especially with a color cover. While reading it the story and language was surprisingly fresh, not �ye old timey-wimey.� The plot is brisk and I believe is enjoyable for modern readers. Why Reprint It? Paperback pulp novels from over a century ago are hard to find. Even more rarer is finding one that isn't shedding paper flakes and even more rarer than that are ones that can be read from cover to cover without coming apart. The 128 pages story is fast paced and full of action. I rarely read fiction and had a hard time putting it down. Read nearly all of in one sitting which is something I've never done before. I think that most everyone will enjoy it also. If the funding goal is reached it will pay for a print quantity of eighty books. If above the goal, the more the better! How Was This Reprint Created? The binding of The Great Express Robbery was taken apart so the pages and cover could be individually scanned laying completely flat at 600 dpi. The cover was extensively retouched and readability of illegible text was restored. I doubt anyone will be disappointed. Disassembled so the pages can be laid flat on the scanner. Most of the retouching was to reduce the yellowing on the pages, being careful that none of the printed ink was removed. Some of the characters in the printing press had too much ink and were blotchy. Some were barely readable due to too little ink. Those were fixed by moving legible ones from other areas of the page on top then erasing the surrounding smudge. The skew of the pages was also corrected and centered. With these minor repairs the easy flow of reading is restored. More info on how this was done will be in upcoming updates! If funded I endeavor to restore and reprint more crime, adventure and romance novels from the 1890's-1910's period. When Does It Ship? If funded, all rewards will ship July, 2019. As soon the printer, Blurb, delivers the books they will be mailed to backers. The interior pages are 100% finished, the cover is 99% finished (the bottom part shown below will be changed) and the spine is done. The only thing left to do is the back cover! The first proof. The text at the bottom will be changed. After the back cover is designed ""The Great Express Robbery"" will be finished and ready for the printing press."

The Fingaz Bowl will drastically improve gameplay of Fingers Drinking Game. The Fingaz Bowl is made of FDA approved plastic and is dishwasher safe to improve cleanliness. But, most importantly, The Fingaz Bowl will be MADE IN AMERICA! The bowl is outfitted with carved out notches for fingers, a shot glass holder, and a spout to drink from. The Fingaz Bowl will come in red or blue. HOW TO PLAY FINGAZ BOWL FEATURES WHEN DID WE START? Fingaz Bowl Timeline OUR STORY After playing countless rounds of fingers drinking game with all sorts of kitchen objects, our founder Julien decided it was time to end this. Once he finished college, he put together a team to accomplish this. After two years of preparation, the Fingaz Bowl is ready for all your pre-games, parties, tailgates, beach days, BBQs, boat days, and good ol� gatherings with friends & family! MANUFACTURING DATES Manufacturing Timeline RULES Fingers is a rapid drinking game which needs no skills other than the ability to count. Each player puts one finger on the rim of the bowl on the finger notch. Next, the player that starts begins a countdown of �3,2,1�. When the player gets to 1 each person must leave their finger on the notch or remove it (this must happen quickly). The player doing the countdown must say a fourth number after his 3,2,1 countdown. This fourth number will be the number of fingers that player believes will be on the bowl at the end of the countdown. This guess can be anything from 0 (all fingers removed) to however many total people are playing. When this has happened, the number of fingers left on the bowl are counted. If the person says the correct number of fingers he or she has guessed correctly and is out for that round and therefor doesn�t need to drink at the end. If they are incorrect they must stay in the game. Everyone puts their fingers back on the bowl and begins to predict the correct number again. The game continues until only one person is left, the loser must drink the all contents of the bowl or shot glass to complete the round. WHO WE ARE CEO - Julien Graduated Sacred Heart University in 2016 with a degree in Business Administration with a focus in International Business. After countless rounds of playing fingers, maybe too many rounds, Julien came up with the idea of creating a custom bowl for the game. Julien spent the next year and a half as a sales rep for a large fortune 500 company. Since, he has been in an client success manager position for a large commercial real estate software company. COO - Thomas is a 2010 graduate of Villanova University where he majored in Philosophy. Thomas is Julien's cousin and had no option other than to play many rounds of Fingers and come on board as the Chief Operating Officer. Thomas founded a medical equipment company in 2008 with his father in Orange, CT. CFO - Jordan graduated from Sacred Heart University in 2016 with a double major in Economics and Finance. Jordan attended the same high school as Julien. However, Neither started playing Fingers until they went off to college. Since graduation Jordan has worked in multiple financial institutions. Jordan is the founder of Followout, a tri-state area based media and social entertainment company. CHEERS!!!"

The radio-guided missile attack resulted in the greatest loss of life at sea by enemy action in the history of US war. However, the German assault on the HMT Rohna was erased from history, along with the men who died when the burning ship sank to the bottom of the sea. We have obtained hundreds of classified documents from both the US and British War Departments Survivors Were Ordered to Remain Silent The US War Department declared the Rohna attack �Classified� ordering all survivors to remain silent in a cover-up scandal that left a thousand Gold Star families in the dark.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 1015 Heroes Were Killed in a Missile Attack and Then Forgotten The families were never told what happened to their boys and their remains still lay at the bottom of the sea. In most cases, there were no funeral services or burials for the forgotten heroes. Six months after the attack, the Gold Star families received one short paragraph confirming the demise of their loved one in a telegram that also stated that there was ""no information available."" That was it; the boys just never came home. May 21, 1944 was the date that most families found out that their loved one died (Six months after the attack). Classified documents confirm that the War Department knew that no one could survive the frigid water temperatures or the rough conditions of the sea that night. Families were Put Through Unnecessary Pain and Anguish The US Government's first sin regarding the attack was the War Department's decision to mislead the Gold Star families giving them false hope for six months when they knew that the 1015 heroes died. The second one was that they Classified the attack indefinitely. What Went Wrong and How Did This Happen? The reason for the cover-up and the secrecy behind the Rohna attack is a 75-year-old question that gets complicated. The HMT Rohna was a British transport ship with an Australian Captain and an Indian crew who were transporting American soldiers. The ship was considered unfit for wartime transportation and in poor condition. It was overcrowded, lifeboats were not in working order, appropriate drills and procedures for operating emergency equipment were not followed. We are still researching and investigating how and why this attack stayed classified even after the war was over as well as why families of the casualties were never told how their boys died. How This Film Got Started I was moving things around in my attic when I came across 23 letters written by a young man who was killed in WWII. The soldier was Sgt. Joseph Pisinski, he was my wife's great uncle. Those letters led me to discovering one of Hitler�s secret weapon attacks that was covered-up by the War Department. It was the first time a radio-guided missile was ever used against the US and resulted in the greatest loss of life at sea by enemy action in the history of US war. This is one of the letters he wrote to his mother from training camp. This is one of 23 letters Sgt. Joseph Pisinski sent home to his mother throughout training camp. After training was completed he boarded the HMT Rohna and was killed in the Rohna attack on his second day of war. The Outreach Program The ROHNA: CLASSIFIED team is on a mission to not only make a great documentary, but also to carry out the promise that the survivors made to find every family of the casualties and tell them the truth. Our Outreach Program, includes a ""Casualty Search"" page on our website. It is headed by Sunny Duncanson and Tracey Bannon whose uncle was a casualty in the Rohna attack. The Outreach Program also includes Rohna programs around the country as well as a Social Studies curriculum that teachers will be able to download from our website. Our goal is not only to get this story into the history books where it belongs, but it will also honor the forgotten soldiers and let their families know the truth behind this historic attack. Most of the casualties were boys in their late teens or early twenties. Documentary Preview Trailer The Rohna documentary will be told through the lives of 3 soldiers who were on the Rohna and one who was on the ship next to it. Two other subjects of the film include the German scientist who invented the the radio-guided missile and was smuggled back to the US and the commanding pilot who launched the deadly missile and asked his son to meet the survivors and apologize on his behalf. With your help, we will tell this story of fate, love, war and triumph. Watch our preview below: How We Will Use the Funds That We Raise Rohna: Classified has been in pre-production for the last year. We have been researching, writing, working on an amazing Outreach Program, making contacts with family members of the subjects and historians, as well as filming and editing promos. We've completed a fundraising reel and premiered our website and Social Media pages. This first phase of fundraising will allow us to move into production as we continue to submit grant applications and pitch Rohna: Classified to networks. These funds will allow us to travel and film in the different locations throughout the country and to continue researching the US and UK National Archives. The Rohna: Classified Team"

I am a proud supporter of the LGBT Community. Both me and my sister are one of the many LGBT supporters/members who live in a household where we cannot show who we are to our family in fear of being kicked out or harassed until we leave. Because of this, it is hard for use to buy pride merchandise and often have to get things that can still be pride but 'lowkey'. After trying to shop for items for this pride month, we found that there are not many things we could get cause it would be too obvious if our parents saw it. I figured we are not the only ones out there who want more lowkey pride merchandise. So I decided to make my own pride merchandise, where it still shows off pride but not too obvious, in the form of delicious cake slices! Enjoy a delicious slice of your favorite flavor and show your pride!

I.e. focused on providing parents a way to match both their children and themselves with other children and parents in their area who they would most likely develop meaningful bonds and community relations with. It is a service for all families consisting of either single or coupled parents, along with any number of children, whose ages range from 1 to 13-years old, and who wish to improve the choices they have for socializing with other suitable families. The prototype site is planned to be completed within sixty (60) days after the end of this Kickstarter Campaign before going on to Beta testing thereafter . Our aim is to have the best service, on and off the Web, for matching entire families with others who would not have otherwise met, in order to help build healthy community relations for children and adults alike. Simply put: Improve family and hence, human relations . Let�s face it: Many times you will get together with a family who you hope and pray will be good for you and your kids. If you're lucky, the children will get along even if the adults don't. On the other hand, the adults may get along fine, but the kids don't. Then of course more often than not, neither the kids nor the adults are motivated to get back together with ""that"" family. But perhaps even more bothersome is how we must spend so much time and effort setting up today�s ""playdates"" and groups, then struggle to drag the father along, only to result in a temporary or superficial outing that no one cares to repeat. There are other issues such as the time it takes to go through the conventional process of finding and meeting families, and we discuss this in more detail below . Many of us are finding our families being isolated in our communities, even though there are hundreds of other families around us. On the one hand, we are limited to going on ""play-dates"" only with those who attend our school, church, mosque, synagogue or extra-curricular activities. On the other hand, even if we had a larger number of families to choose from, how would we know whether they are compatible with our interests and values or not? What seems to add to the problem is the growing trend of using high-tech devices which appears to cause families to not only become more and more disconnected from other families, but even disconnected within their own. High-tech gadgets and technology are not bad in and of themselves, but the way we are using them, is frankly endangering our social relationships. FamilyMatch is founded, operated and driven by parents who are confronting the dramatic changes that our modern-day world forces upon us. Parents who have lived, worked and even had their children enrolled in schools located in the United States, Australia, India, Pakistan, Dominican Republic and England. Not only did they find it time consuming and difficult to identify the right families to get together with, but they witnessed that around the globe, parents encounter the same issue. Technology has changed the face and nature of families more than any other period in history. From children being connected to games and their friends through devices, to adults being plugged into their jobs as never before. These demands are put on us in ways that isolates us from having the healthy physical connections that families in the past enjoyed. The Founders of FamilyMatch recognize this. Some of them have actually been directly part of the earliest online matching systems since 2010 and have now marshalled their experience and know-how to develop an online service that is designed to dramatically improve a family�s social and community life. So instead of letting technology diminish or eliminate your family�s social life, you can now use technology to intelligently expand or reduce your family�s orbit, versus letting it randomly shrink or grow it Next, they spent 14 months conducting focus-group surveys of over 2600 parents which resulted in 98.3 claiming that they needed something like FamilyMatch to help them with finding suitable families whom they can be matched with. They collectively agreed that as long as FamilyMatch maintains the best possible security of their family's information that they would readily use and incorporate it into their lives. The founders' aim is to use technology to give families the control to expand their family's orbit with families whom they would not otherwise be able to connect with. The system is in prototype, pre-Beta stage and is designed to not only more accurately identify those who would be suitable for each other, but to be a safer way for families to get together because they would have been pre-screened by FamilyMatch as well as yourself. This is why we created FamilyMatch! Step 1: Create A Profile; Step 2: Fill Out Values & Characteristics Matching Survey; Step 3: FamilyMatch's patented algorithm goes to work; and, Step 4: Browse matching families and start planning family gatherings and events Parents start by creating a FamilyMatch� profile. All of this information will be backed by our absolute privacy guaranty. We will never share our users personal data with others, and even within FamilyMatch, only highly classified personnel shall have access to such under Board of Director supervision. The Profile will consist of basic information such as name, single or coupled parents, number of children and other similar information. Once the profile is completed, you will then be ready to move on to the confidential FamilyMatch Survey. Next, is the FamilyMatch survey where the foundational pre-screening takes place. We will ask the parent(s) questions about their family's values, characteristics and qualities that will help our algorithm find the best family for yours. This information is not processed by humans, but our highly secured algorithm which has been developed by some of the best matching experts in the world. Our survey shall allow you to answer a few questions and save others for later, so that you are in control of how much time you spend on it. We also do not make these questions mandatory. You decide what you wish or do not wish to provide. Note: The more our parents answer during the survey process, the more accurate your matches will be. Once you have made a family profile, our website will begin to analyze other families in your area. You will never be forced to accept any family or even have your identity known to them. You will always be in control of the process at every stage. We will present our FamilyMatch recommendations to you for you to make a choice of which families to get together with, or not. Once you have selected a family you will be able to access messaging and other features in order to establish contact. The choices will be to go at the pace that you and the other family is comfortable with. Some may be ready and willing to meet each other right away, others may need to go one step at a time. e.g. text or email each other for a period, before speaking on the phone then meeting at your own designated place or at a FamilyMatch event. As an additional feature, we are developing a model where there will be FamilyMatch Events in each area that will be exclusive to FamilyMatch Members, which will be focused on family activities, relational work-ships, speakers and more, sponsored by FamilyMatch. FamilyMatch is a convenient and time saving concept. Our Focus Groups have found that mothers, on average can spend 1 to 2 hours a day emailing, calling, and talking with other mothers to see when and where they can meet for playdates. After you become a FamilyMatch Member, each time that you wish to find a family to partner with will take a few minutes to find. Also, FamilyMatch's pre-screening process filters out surprises and cuts down on time to find families who have similar qualities and values as yours. This helps you avoid the trial-and-error playdates and focus on quality time spend in actual activities. There are times when someone is more of a indoor piano playing-child and the other child that you ""playdate"" with, turns out to be an insatiable soccer fan. Ninety percent of the time this arrangement simply doesn�t work. The families end up in frustration with a feeling of wasting their time and resulting in not seeing each other again. Some times they ultimately they give up on the entire playdate scene itself. Parents clearly need a way to minimize the effort it takes to find the right family and be able to do this at a time that they can control. FamilyMatch aims to encourage families to have more social interactions with great matches and become a family's personal Match-Maker! First and foremost is the security of FamilyMatch users in general, particularly the children. We do live in a world where some bad-actors prey on children and women. We are guaranteeing that FamilyMatch will deploy the best means possible for preventing those types from being part of our system and if any slip through the cracks, to identify and terminate them right out of the system. We are partnering with national and international security background check companies to stand on the front line, and there will be other things used to identify them as well. Concerning personal information: We will not sell any personal data about any family, nor will we give such away. Once we begin our Beta testing our system will be housed on the most secured servers in the world except for most governmental ones . At this stage of our pre-launching into Beta testing, we are currently on open servers where our prototype is being developed. Part of the reason for this crowdfunding campaign is to position this technology to be deployed from one of the most secured Cloud system(s) in the world. e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS) or google's storage platform. Either one of these actually touts security that is beyond anything that the U.S. and other governments have for web security. We plan to actually issue a guaranty which will comment the company to paying any user whose data is breached. Lastly, all of our personal data shall be encrypted within our system so that even if James Bond were to penetrate our system's security they would not have the encryption keys to unlock any information. There are over a thousand matching services out there, but not a single one is helping families meet new families to build friendships. FamilyMatch is the very first service that is exclusively focused on bringing families together in hopes of improving family relations. Our challenge is to inform and capture the market before competitors arise. Our founders have a unique background in working with technology to match lawyers and clients who need their services. We are using such knowledge and experience now to bring families an incredible and easy experience with a lifetime of reward through rich experiences. Dr. Salma Merritt, MD, after spending several years in her medical career, was married to David Merritt and 2005. He was a former electronic engineer turned sales and marketing manager for LegalMatch.com, a site that focused on matching lawyers and clients together. He then launched a private company focused on bringing innovative children products to the market. Mother's 3rd Arm has been one of his greatest successes since 2009. Still selling at motherthirdarm.com and recently taken off of amazon and other retailers so he could put full attention on FamilyMatch. They authored 20th Century American Struggle, 21st Century Hope, a non-fiction work focused on improving race, gender and culture relations in the U.S. After they completed their National book tour with Barnes & Noble and others--2007-2008--they had their first child and in about 2 more years their 2nd. Both were novices on raising children, and both were very concerned about nurturing their kids. Salma worked as an in-home mom, prioritizing her children over her medical career. They agreed on finding a nurturing pre-K school for the children, experimented with homeschooling before joining a Parent Participating preschool. Ultimately they placed their kids in different private and charter schools before deciding on a unique, highly prized private elementary school. The Merritts started with live-in nannies in the heart of Silicon Valley. They then agreed on finding nurturing pre-K schools for their kids, before getting involved in homeschooling which led to joining a Parent Participating preschool. Ultimately they placed their kids in charter then private schools. In the end, no matter what type of schooling they did, there was always a growing difficulty in finding �the right� families to get together with. It was constantly a struggle. What was telling is the fact that they never met any parent who did not face the same struggles. Then finally, after meeting dozens of families who ""wished that there was a better way"" they commissioned numerous focus groups, mostly in the U.S. and Canada, who overwhelming wanted a tool which could truly help them. Salma struggled with setting up �playdates.� it was not only the logistics of getting together with other families but most of the time the children�s were not really a good match for each other. It was also a struggle to encourage David to join her in family gatherings with others, as it was for other women to encourage their husband to be part of it. The name FamilyMatch itself was obtained more than 20 years ago by co-founder Christina Stanbridge who founded and runs the London Nanny Company located in London and Kensignton, United Kingdom. She did not imagine that the name FamilyMatch would be making history in the 21st Century as the first family matching web service in the world, but she was ""tickled"" to join the Founder's team. Her own personal and professional paths lead her heart to focus on providing a service that matched nannies to care for the elderly as well as children. She and the Merritts met over the phone in 2017 and once she heard and felt the idea and motivation, she decided to join the effort before partnering with them to make FamilyMatch a reality. For their part, the Merritts were mostly inspired by seeing and understanding how some countries maintain solid family relations among themselves and develop loving bonds with other family groups which are not biological tied to them. Comparing such to the Western countries in general and the United States in particular, they came to believe that a tool for matching the right families together would go a long way in bringing health to community relations . Where Will The Funds Go?  40% Marketing  40% App & Web Development  10% Event Planning Costs  5% Referrals  5% Salary Product Specific FAQs: 1. How secure will my family�s information be? We live in a world where some bad-actors prey on children and women. At FamilyMatch not only do we understand this and willingly face this challenge, but we will guarantee that FamilyMatch will deploy the best means possible for preventing those types of folks from being part of our system. If any predators slip through the cracks, we will identify and terminate them right out of the system. We are partnering with national and international security background check companies to work on the front lines to wall out predators from our system. 2. Can we pause our membership? Going on vacation? Well you can pause your membership, but if you are an Elite Member, you can use FamilyMatch anywhere in the world. Otherwise, if you wish to suspend your monthly payments, you can pause your monthly payments to fit your time. We understand that other life priorities take hold of your time (money) and you should not have to pay for an inactive subscription. 3. Can we upload photos of our families on our Familymatch profile? Yes, you can upload photos on your Familymatch profile. Dare to share and let those selfies that consume your phone�s storage see the light of day! 4. How long does it take to build a Familymatch profile? The profile itself takes anywhere from five to 10 minutes. The subsequent survey is where our algorithm comes alive to matching your family with others. No survey question is mandatory, but the more data you provide, the more accurate your FamilyMatch will be. So it depends on how much time you�re willing to commit, but you are not required to commit it all in one sitting. You can choose to answer some questions in one sitting, and return later to answer more. Our system will save the place where you left off. 5. How long does it take to match with another family? Once you have provided our algorithm in with the information you wish to provide, it will just time minutes for it to search our database before showing you who the best candidates are for your family. It is to your discretion whether or not you chose to message them and attempt to become BFFs (or Best Friends Forever)! 6. Why is it important for my children to socialize with other families? Socialization is a key ingredient for personal growth and development of a child�s individuality. In order to share, set boundaries, and solve problem comes from socializing and interacting. You can Google it and you�ll find thousands of experts elaborating on the importance of getting your child engaged with others. We as parents are not going to be with our children in all of their future interactions, so just as we provide them the best food to eat when raising them, we must also provide them the best opportunities that we can to equip them for the world which they are going to face. 7. Is FamilyMatch a socially conscious technology? The whole reason why we created a FamilyMatch is to improve our communities. We know that technology has created separation from each other, so ironically, we are intentionally using technology in a way to bring us back into closer connection with one another. Just as there are people focused on curing the cancer that cigarettes create, we need folks who can focus on improving the disconnections that technology produces. Socializing with other families will also improve a personal relationships within the family as well as between each family in our communities. 8. What if I didn't like the family that I met with, but they are inviting us to meet again? Our system Rules & Guidelines will set the boundaries on how family interactions should take place. One of the Rules will be on prerogative, so that when a family request another family to meet, and the second family declines, the first family will be obligated to respect that family�s space. You can proceed to select other families that we have suggested for you and your family at any time. You should not have to settle for a family that just not the right fit. 9. What if I want to meet families unlike mine? Yes, you can absolutely do that. We will match you based on preferences that you provide. We understand that sometimes you want to see what different minded people are like as you try to break from your daily norm. Who knows? They just might spark a new interest in you. 10.What is the best way to arrange the first meeting? We recommend meeting in a public place, during the day while having a bite or participate in a mutually liked activity. If you have been touched by FamilyMatch, but can�t financially back us at this time, please take the time to share with your network on your social media pages. It would really help us out. You can reach more people than you think. If you know any families that would like or need FamilyMatch, you can participate and give the membership or other gifts to them or simply let them know about this campaign. Our official hashtag is #FamilyMatchOfficial."

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The Idea for the Zephyr Yes! occurred because I was given a prescription of added exercise, by my doctor; at the same time, I was experiencing symptoms of menopause (including, Hot Sweats). Due to the changes of my routine, and my body, the application of makeup became arduous and very unpleasant, at best. I was too balmy after hot sweats and workouts to apply makeup; this was not helping my esteem nor motivation, at all! I thought to myself, ""There has to be a solution for this malady!"" I Prayed to God for relief of of this plight. God's answer was, "" Use the Gifts I have given You""... Thus, the Zephyr Yes! was born. This Mirror will illuminate as well as cool the user! With its integrated, three-speed fan, the Zephyr Mirror will blow air which will help set makeup by allowing it to dry faster. The mirror will provide both 1X and 10X magnification( by flipping mirror ) and illumination with three levels of brightness, LED lighting. Lighting and cooling is provided on both sides of mirror; just spin it to go from regular or 1X to 10X magnification. A 120V standard outlet is all that is needed to power the mirror. The mirror can be used by placing it on any level surface or by mounting it to a wall, door, etc., with the included mounting plate. I plan to develop future generations of this product to include battery operation and/or a USB charger, which will allow greater portability. My vision is that this product will end up in every home, gym, makeup studio, school and movie set, hospital, etc., so that the application of makeup and serums may become speedy and pleasurable. The cooling provided by the mirror will allow makeup to set, mascara to dry, and serums to absorb, with comfort and efficiency. Beauty can be fun and soothing again! The Zephyr Yes! is both design, and technology, patents pending. This Kickstarter Project will be used to fund manufacturing of the Zephyr Mirror prototype, the product itself, to get UL (Underwriters Laboratories) standard certification, and get product to the market. I also intend to donate to charitable causes that help Autism, Veterans and The Homeless."

I�m creating Elurra Jewelry to fill this gap in the market of jewelry that captures one�s awe in design but is also worth the money in durability and quality. Most of our competitors trying to serve the same market, like Stella+Dot, fail in either producing pieces not worth the price tag or pieces that turn green within a month. This is because they use metals that are gold plated that easily oxidize and turn green. We're able to solve these problems by creating our pendants and earring out of laser cut two sided brushed gold or silver acrylic which can't tarnish and by using sterling silver chains that can last decades without rusting. The materials we chose also have a focus in sustainability as they help eliminate the need for fast fashion through using longer lasting materials for an affordable price. We�re asking you to join us so we can begin our journey as a business and retail our jewelry online. In order to do this we need $815 for *All items will be shipped after the kickstarter has ended If you have any questions send us an email at elurrajewelry@gmail.com or check out our Instagram @elurra.jewelry"

The casual noodle bar is an expansion of successful Malaysian pop up under the @EatWithTracy Instagram handle, which has received encouraging support around the Bay Area since 2013. The restaurant will be specializing in traditional Malaysian noodle meals collectively known as laksa. The mid-range casual eatery offers a menu of assorted laksa options, appetizers, seasonal specials and beverages. What others say about Tracy's Malaysian food: San Francisco Chronicle Eater Testimonials Background: Tracy was born and raised in Malaysia. She moved to the United States in 2012 where she subsequently left her desk job to become a food entrepreneur. In the beginning, cooking for no more than six guests was more of a cultural exchange social gathering in an attempt to meet new friends who enjoyed food just as much. The intimate dinner parties quickly turned into 20 to 60 people events. Fast forward to 2019, over 500 pop-ups and a few thousand diners later, we are ready for a permanent space. Tracy hosting a brunch in her former Sunset District 1BR apartment, circa 2014. Damansara's Vision: We want to extend the warm tropical spirit of Malaysia and share another type of noodle experience with this city that really embraces noodle soups from other parts of Asia. Damansara's Malaysian food is hot, full of flavor and comforting on the many foggy days in San Francisco. Why You Should Back This Project: 1) If you have been following our sporadic pop-up journey and wishing you could one day stop by at your convenience instead of waiting for a pop-up date that finally works for you - Damansara Restaurant is your answer :) 2) If you're reading this and find yourself wondering what laksa is and why there are hardly any actual Malaysian restaurants in the city, now is the time to help fill the void. 3) Rewards. We're all about meaningful connections, so we have chosen to spend time on creating special (and delicious) experiences with you in person rather than emphasizing on shipping things. That said, the limited edition items are thoughtfully designed and selected by Tracy and talented friends. How We Will Use the Fund: 1) Staffing: Good people are valuable assets to a business. 2) Inventory: Equipment, furniture, fixtures, tableware...things we need to get started. 3) The Space: Renovations, fresh paint, things we need to get the space ready for opening. Is the Food Going to be a Hit? Come taste it for yourself before backing. We're still actively popping up every weekend. Make a reservation before June 29 to find out if Tracy's got the chops. The Name: ""Damansara"" is named after Tracy's childhood home in Damansara Utama, a suburb that borders the west of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital city. The neighborhood hosts some of the most popular hawker centers and restaurants in the city. Bandana Design (WIP) Updated 06/18/19: Here's the sketch for the bandana.

But often I know that people are unable to attend those speeches and while they love my method and delivery, haven't been able to benefit from what I can share. I often bristle at the idea of being called a motivational speaker because I have found many in the field do not present an accurate or true account of reality. Perhaps it is a touch of cynicism on my part but I have never been one who believes in the kumbaya spirit. As such I was always reluctant to write a book that was about much more than what I felt I could really talk about: running. However, given that running is such a small part of my life, and has just been the conduit which people have found out about what I have accomplished and still strive to do, I was finally convinced by enough cajoling to put my thoughts on inspiration and motivation down on paper. To me, Ignore The Impossible is not just a mantra but rather the non-motivational-lovers phrase to motivate. It is the book which brings truth and reality to those looking to be inspired but who do not wish to be pandered to. I show from my own life experiences, as well as the lessons I have learned from countless others, how to succeed in life. These are ironclad solutions to problems of every ilk. They are all ways in which we can improve our station in life, rise above our troubles, and bring others with us. I never say we can do anything we want. I have always said that the only way to find out what you can do is to ignore the impossible and try it anyway."

We are a group of three guys from Minnesota that have been involved with gaming our whole lives. Board games, tabletop games, dice games, card games you name it, we�ve played it. Using our experience of games we intend to bring you games you�ll love. In a world where technology is everywhere in our lives, it may become difficult to find reasons to connect with friends and family. We hope our games are those reasons. What is Kooky Cooks? Our first game is called Kooky Cooks. It�s a wacky educational card game that utilizes money math skills and introduces youngsters to exciting new foods in unusual dishes. Kooky Cooks is a game that is easy for kids to learn and engaging for parents to enjoy. Our game is specifically designed for 2-6 players aged 8 and up. In our game, players take on the role of a Kooky Cook. Racing to complete as many orders as they can, players scramble to earn the most cash before time runs out. Throughout player turns, customers continuously fill the restaurant and request bizarre dishes. In order to cook these dishes, players will need to play specific combinations of ingredients from their hands. Along the way players may find special ingredients that have game changing abilities ranging from gathering extra ingredients to kicking out customers. Kooky Cooks is a game that has been years in the making. It started as just an idea that was discussed and debated until we felt it was ready for playtesting. We used note cards with handwritten information in order to playtest the original version of Kooky Cooks. Through many playtests the game went through a multitude of very small tweaks to major changes to create the perfect version. Currently we have a professionally printed prototype of Kooky Cooks that we use to show and play with friends and family and whoever else is interested in our game. We are now working with our manufacturer to create the best possible copy of the game. So what do I get if I back your game? We have three different Pledge Tiers where you can get a first run copy of our game. + $6 for shipping at this pledge tier Free shipping at this pledge tier. Free shipping at this pledge tier.

Build Kinazium and Augmented Reality Games Kinazium and Augmented Reality Some robots give you the ability to develop your own games. With open source tools for creating Augmented Reality it's not a big a leap to create games with virtual opponents in your physical kinazium game! In this example we took a 3D animated character, attached her to the target and programed her to disappear if the target disappears, which happens when the robot rolls over the target. Knock out characters and Score! You decide the characters, you make the rules, you determine the scoring. You (and your students) are the creator of amazing robot games! We've Journeyed from Rapid Prototyping to Fully Tested and Ready to Manufacture Kinazium has been extensively tested at home, in schools and at events, tuning the product until it is exactly right. We've selected child safe materials with characteristics that unleash the imagination in kids. We've designed the pegs to fit the hands of kids and adults. We've set our supply chains in motion and have received samples for production. Traxart Toys is ready to launch Kinazium! Join us on this exciting journey."

Players each control a hero, arrange them in a formation, and prepare for the oncoming waves of monsters, traps, treasure. If they can survive this automatically-advancing onslaught, then they win as a team. Each player controls one hero. Each hero represents a different theme: chaos, order, harmony, or discipline. Their hero choice decides their starting deck of cards. Each different theme has a different playstyle, but also informs what future cards they can add to their deck. Across from the party line-up is the deadly dungeon itself. Whenever a card is removed from the dungeon, be it by killing a monster, the dungeon automatically shifts towards the players. This game is incredibly fast-paced: no moving, exploring, or down-time. This dungeon is coming at you full-speed! Fighting is resolved by playing unique combinations of cards, but be careful!

Since launching in March 2019 we have published 10 blog posts and interviewed and photographed almost 10 environmental artists of color to publish their stories in our upcoming print issue. The purpose of this fundraiser is to elevate the voices of environmental artists of color in a printed magazine and host a launch party that fosters an environmental POC community space in the Bay Area. WHO ARE WE? Alluvia Magazine is a publication and creative collective started in 2018 by two environmental artists in the Bay Area. Zahira and Isaias created Alluvia with 3 components: - Print Magazine: a color printed and bound magazine featuring the founders and mission statement, interviews and photo shoots with at least 10 environmental artists of color from across the US, and a list of artists featured on our online blog. - Blog: our blog at alluviamag.com has featured artwork, listicles, opinion pieces and interviews with environmental artists of color from around the world. - Creative Collective: the artists featured both on the blog and print issue will be connected to one another through this creative process in an effort to grow community for environmental artists of color. We�re currently in the process of finishing our first print zine. It will include interviews and photo-shoots with artists that upend the mainstream narrative of white environmentalism. We hope to show the environmental and art community that mainstream white environmentalism is not the single narrative in the environmental movement. WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING? We started this project as a labor of love. We are self-funded and all costs so far have been paid for out of our own pockets. The money we raise will help us print our first zine (and future ones!), plan our launch event, and connect our featured artists to one another. WHERE DOES YOUR DONATION GO? $150 for printing 150 magazines- Colored and glossy magazines around 25 pages using dynamic digital portrait photographs and long-form interviews to highlight the narratives of 10-12 environmental artists of color from across the US. Artists featured on our blog will also have their names printed, in addition to our mission statement. $200-$250 venue costs - the cost of reserving an event space in the Bay Area for 2 hours. This event will be a POC environmental space intended to sell our first print issue on a sliding scale, possible performances, food and nurturing of a vibrant POC environmental community $50 - colored stickers with the Alluvia logo on a green leaf background intended to be sold on a sliding scale $50 for pins - colored pins with the Alluvia logo on a green leaf background intended to be sold on a sliding scale WHAT IS OUR IMPACT? The environmental and climate movement is a one-sided and whitewashed narrative when people of color around the world are disproportionately affect by the deadly impacts of climate change. Current environmental curriculum highlight the contributions of white leaders but neglect to uplift the stories of people of color and their relationships to environmentalism. We've provided a platform for POC and QTPoC to connect, share, and publish their environmental artwork. We believe in the power of storytelling and creating spaces for environmental artists to have the recognition and force of change that disrupts the white environmental landscape. We also believe that it's important to hold spaces in real life for our community to have fun, while making sure our events are all safe and inclusive environments (#POCTOTHEFRONT). We will make sure that our launch event is a fun and safe environment to show love for one another, share stories and cultivate friendships. WHAT IF WE DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING? Without funding, we won't be able to: Document the stories of environmental artists of color and print these stories in a zine. These stories and magazine will continue to be carried on to future generations. Create a launch event that fosters IRL creative POC environmental community. HEAR IT FOR YOURSELF: ""Alluvia Magazine was one of my first supporters when building my brand. Thanks to this platform I feel that my perspective as an environmentalist of color is valid and powerful."" - Kristy Drutman, Creator of Brown Girl Green ""Alluvia Magazine is not only a publication but a creative collective that allowed me to connect with other POC Environmentalist that helped me understand more environmental issues going on in the world. They've continuously shown me that people of color have an important role to play in the Environmental movement and are doing great things as educators, activists and business owners.

The entire film takes place on Cal�s patio next to his pool, where he is visited only by his agent, his intern, and a claymation blue jay. The movie imagines a celebrity living a surreal, isolated existence in luxury, mistaking his life of leisure for one of contentment. Our film�s main character is an amalgamation of action movie stars given depth beyond the tabloid items, PR-sanctioned sound bites, and magazine profiles used to construct them. Cal holds a firm belief in a meritocracy; that he has worked hard as an artist, and has proven himself by the metric of commercial success. Cal accepts his good fortune unemotionally and unwaveringly because it's rooted firmly in fact: Cal is a very good actor. He believes himself to be exceptional, especially compared the vapid film industry types that surround him. But the movie places all three characters in the same boat, and the audience quickly realizes what Cal can�t bear to admit; that there isn�t that much difference between Cal and the industry after all. The short film delves into celebrity culture and male stardom. It�s set in a familiar world that steadily reveals itself to be absurd and untethered from reality. Days melt together, human existence is limited to the deck of a pool, and we chit-chat with a bird made out of clay that squawks for four pages straight. The movie probes humankind's comical ineptness at tackling larger existential questions, specifically the ineptness of men when they've achieved the societal hallmarks of success that they themselves have established. There is bitterness and a sense of isolation that comes from knowing you're unsatisfied when you feel you have no reason to be - when everyone, and every definition of success, leads you to believe that you should be content. The strange shores someone has to shipwreck upon before they finally turn their gaze upon themselves are unique to each situation. In this case, it's the deck of a multi-million dollar pool in California. Kickstarters are an all-or-nothing endeavor - we need to meet our goal in order to keep any of the money raised! Your contribution will go towards our production budget which takes into account - Crew and actor rates Renting camera and lighting equipment Location fees Short-term insurance policy used to rent film equipment and release the location Production expenses such as overflow parking for select shoot days, supplies to protect the location from potential damage from filming, tables, chairs, toilet paper, hand soap, trash bags, and anything else you need to consider when you're responsible for human beings for 12 hour long workdays Feeding crew and actors on set We're doing our part to make this film on as small a scale as possible. This translates to 9 crew members, 3 actors, 3 shoot days, and 1 shoot location. Everyone we're bringing on board knows the scale of the production; an indie film means half the pay and working twice as hard. The blue jay can't sing without your support!

I feel a little tacky saying that, even though I've been wanting to make this DVD for years and scheduled it last September. But I'm realizing that the memory of the fire adds resonance to the film, and to our score. And when the Cathedral is rebuilt, that memory will remain. Quasimodo at Notre Dame The Hunchback of Notre Dame is an edgy film, made from Victor Hugo's epic tale of love, religion and greed. It's quirky, moody and passionate, even disturbing. It's full of ghosts. I can't help but see echoes of the fire in the despair of Quasimodo on the whipping block, the savagery of the beggar king, Esmeralda's terror in the torture chamber. I think we will play differently, thinking about the fire, and you may have a different experience watching it. And to me, this reinforces the power of art; to help us accept tragedy and reconcile ourselves to loss. One rather spooky thing; I realized that in our recorded version, we could use the actual sound of the bells of Notre Dame, recorded the day before the fire. Here they are. Let me tell you a bit about who we are. 2019 is HESPERUS' 40th anniversary! We've spent that time collaborating with film, theater, dance and storytellers, and creating crossover fusions with traditional musicians from all over the world. Since we started performing early film scores in 2003 we've created eight of them, of music from the time the film was set, not made. We think it grounds the film, gives audiences a sense of time and place. For The Hunchback it's medieval French music by Guillaume de Machaut, Jehan Lescurel and others; we sing it, and play it on medieval instruments, vielle and rebec, recorders, shawms and lute. We see our musical mission as bringing the past into the present, giving 21st century audiences context, appreciation and enjoyment. My goal is record all eight films; Hunchback is the third. So you see, I think there's a difference between exploiting an event and memorializing it. We play with love and respect, with the goal of getting closer to the actors and the story they're telling. Will you consider supporting our project?"

The Warrens are a living landscape, constantly changing and adapting to the lives on and within them. Maps are almost useless, requiring scouting parties to constantly update others on how the lands have changed. It is a world of the bizarre and unexpected, where weirdness awaits at every turn. The people of the Warrens survive under the protection of so-called gods. They slave away to satisfy the needs of these creatures their cities are built upon Hunt Monstrous Beasts The corruption has spread to the beasts of the Warrens, possessing them with an infectious madness. During your journey to find the source of the corruption, hunting the tainted beasts will improve your strength and your chances of survival. But the corruption twists their bodies as well.

You must learn what you can of these creatures and their occult capabilities if you ever hope to overcome them. Gain Power from Elder Deities Ancient, inscrutable beings exist within the Warrens, and none are more omnipresent than the Elder Deities.

Through the art of fleshsmithing, you can consume the parts of creatures to grow them as your own. Gain the special attacks and abilities of the creatures you once feared!

Continues! An age of magic once existed in our world. Lost to history, this time is remembered in the echoes of myth and legend. The land was once besieged by the Horrors, foul creatures from the depths of astral space that seek to feed on and destroy all that is living and good. Their time -- the time of the Scourge -- has passed. The people of the world have returned to the surface reclaiming the lands that were once their home. Brave heroes band together to explore the wilds of Barsaive, fighting the Horrors that remain and protecting their loved ones from those who would dominate and enslave them. Earthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game currently in its fourth edition. After more than 25 years it continues to deliver a setting tinged with a compelling mix of high magic and horror flavored with a dash of post-apocalypse and a generous sprinkling of hope. An adventurer faces off against some cadaver men The Latest Sourcebook We have released several products for the Earthdawn line in the past five years: Three core rulebooks (Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, and Companion), three sourcebooks (Travar: The Merchant City, Elven Nations, and Questors), a GM Screen, Quick Start Guide, and several entries in our ongoing Legends of Barsaive adventure series. The next sourcebook is ready to go. This campaign is to help cover production costs of paying the freelancers (writers, artists, and other production staff) who contributed to the book, and pay for printing and physical production. That new book is The Adept's Journey: Mystic Paths. Planned to be roughly 400 pages, it introduces the concept of Paths, organizations in the Earthdawn game that reflect a particular goal and outlook. They modify an adept's Discipline, giving them access to new talents and unique abilities. This gives you new challenges to face and stories to tell as your character's legend grows. Some of the paths might be familiar to long-time Earthdawn players, while others bring brand-new concepts to the game. Twelve are included in the book: The Brother of Stone is an obsidiman who seeks a greater connection with their Liferock and the living earth. A Fire Eater is dedicated to controlling--and gaining power from--an ork's gahad. Horror Stalkers are dedicated to tracking, facing, and destroying Horrors. The Journeyman is focused on enhancing a human's ability to easily learn magical abilities from other Disciplines. Liberators strive to free Namegivers from slavery--whether literal or metaphorical. Messengers openly spread news and deliver critical messages, but secretly gather intelligence to ensure Barsaive's independent future. Outcasts follow their own path, drawing strength from their personal definition of honor. The Purifier devotes their life to healing the world, cleansing it of the Horrors' lingering taint. Scholars focus on learning, the codification of accumulated knowledge, and making that knowledge widely available. The t'skrang Tail Dancer learns to use their tail to enhance their fighting prowess. Windmasters are windlings who turn their mobility and speed into impressive advantage. Elves who follow the Woodsman path have unparalleled understanding of, and connection to, the forest they call home. In addition to these twelve Paths, the book includes three Disciplines: Boatmen are a variant of the Air Sailor, focused on riverboats instead of airships. The Gauntlet is a new combat Discipline dedicated to unarmed combat and making themselves an implacable living weapon. A Shaman is a magician who studies the living world and builds relationships with the spirits of wild places. Of special note, the Shaman has been rebuilt from the ground up with a dedicated spell list and a new type of spirit. In addition to the rules required to play these varied character options, each Path and Discipline has an in-character essay (similar to those found in Questors) that provides insight into how these adepts see the world and practice their special magic. A Nethermancer and his friend Rewards, Add-Ons, and Stretch Goals Back this Kickstarter, and you get access to the pre-art draft of the manuscript (it will be linked in a backers-only post shortly after the campaign closes). We offer this to show that the text is complete, and give you a look at what you're backing. At this point the book just needs to make its way through the rest of the production process. As the campaign progresses, excerpts of the material in the book will be provided. We're offering the new book in PDF and physical versions, and the PDF is included with any physical reward. We also have reward tiers that include previously released books in case you missed our earlier Kickstarter or weren't aware the game had returned. The prices here are lower than you'll find elsewhere (even our own web shop), and they are all in print and in stock, so there wouldn't be any additional wait for delivery. Reward Tier Breakdown If the bundles are too... complete for you (for example, you already have the Player's & Gamemaster's Guides and just need the Companion), our first suggestion is that you gift those books to friends! But we will also have add-ons for individual books. Prices (and additional shipping charges) are listed below. You can add one of the Earthdawn anniversary pins for $4. Created for the game's twenty-fifth anniversary, these were available to attendees at GenCon in 2018, as well as some backers of the previous Earthdawn Kickstarter. Like the other books, they are in stock and will ship with your other physical product. Earthdawn 25th Anniversary Pin We have two planned stretch goals, which will be available as add-ons if they are unlocked. First, if we reach $10,000 we will produce a poster-size version of the Barsaive map included in the Fourth Edition Gamemaster's Guide. The art is already done, we just need to put it into production. A new large-scale map has been a popular request, and it would be great if we could bring it to you. Adding on the poster will be $5 for backers. Second, if we reach $15,000 we will make a hardcover version of the new book available as an upgrade. This is currently planned to be a Kickstarter-exclusive; we will produce enough to fill the orders, but not many more. Upgrading to the hardcover option will be an extra $15. The design for this hardcover will match the hardcovers from the previous campaign: blue cover with silver inlay for the title, logo, and Namegiver portrait. Two additional stretch goals have been added. If we reach $25,000, all backers who receive any level of product will get the form-fillable PDF character sheet at no extra charge. This sheet automatically derives many game characteristics, as well as fills in Step Dice where appropriate. At $40,000 we will do a new limited hardcover print run of the core rulebooks. These hardcovers will have a different design than the ones from the first campaign to distinguish them from the originals, and we'll take the opportunity to update them (and the associated PDF files) with errata. These books will be $75 each + $2 shipping. Stretch Goals The anniversary pin can be added to any pledge. If added to a pledge level with print books, there is no extra shipping charge. If added to a PDF-only pledge, a $4 shipping charge will be added. If the poster map is unlocked, it will be available as an add-on for any reward tier with similar shipping charges -- free with any other physical product, $4 on its own. You can get both the pin and poster (if that's all you want) for only $4 shipping. The hardcover (aka ""blue-back"") version of the Mystic Paths book (if unlocked) can added as a $15 upgrade to a reward tier that include the physical book. If you want the ""deluxe"" hardcover version instead, that is a $35 upgrade. Likewise, if your reward tier includes physical copies of the core books, those can be upgraded to the deluxe hardcovers for $35 each (with no additional shipping charge). For those who are looking to fill in holes in their collection that an existing pledge bundle doesn't satisfy, we are offering single-book add-on options, as follows: Single Book Add-On Options These individual books include the PDF at no additional charge. If you are adding physical product to a PDF-only tier, the first book is $8 shipping (even if it is noted as free shipping above), with added costs based on additional books ordered. If you want to add an additional copy of Mystic Paths (for example, you're upgrading your print copy to hardcover, but want a softcover as well), softcover is $40, hardcover is $55 (+$2 shipping per book). For all add-ons, please include the amount of the add-on in your pledge. You will be able to select the specific add-ons as part of the survey at the end of the campaign. You can adjust your pledge amount at any point before the campaign ends. Earthdawn Core Book Covers New to Earthdawn? Earthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game originally released in 1993. It was named one of ""The Millennium's Most Underrated Games"" by Pyramid magazine in 1999, and 24th in Arcane magazine's 1996 reader poll of the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time. Now in its fourth edition, the game delivers a rich setting flavored with high fantasy, post-apocalypse, and horror. After a successful Kickstarter to launch the new edition, the reception from fans has been broadly positive and many more new fans have come into the fold. Players step into the role of adepts, individuals who draw on a variety of magical powers to explore the world, recover knowledge lost to the Scourge, and fight those that threaten the lives of innocents--including the Horrors that remain in darker corners of the world. Each adept follows a Discipline, defining the focus and scope of their magical abilities. Some adepts hone their fighting prowess, some enhance their mental and social abilities, while others learn and cast spells. The core game engine of Earthdawn is the Step System. As your character gains power and advances along the path of their Discipline you roll progressively larger dice, with open-ended rolls allowing for potentially legendary results. Adepts can boost their magical abilities through the use of karma, which adds additional dice to your rolls. The Earthdawn Quick Start Guide (available free at our web shop or on Drive-Thru RPG) provides a great overview of the game system, examples of the magical powers available, and includes sample characters and a brief introductory adventure. Namegivers of Barsaive Returning to Earthdawn? If you've been away from Earthdawn for a while, you'll find many familiar things in the new edition, while others have changed to open up design space and incorporate lessons learned from previous versions, as well as other RPGs released over the years. First, as mentioned above, the core game engine remains largely the same. The specific dice used at each Step have been tweaked in a couple of places to smooth out some bumps in the underlying probability, but still uses all the common polyhedrals. The game no longer uses the success level table from previous editions, now the game counts successes--for every five points over the target number, the character scores an additional success. This success mechanic has been incorporated into most of the game's talents, skills, and spells so that--in general--better rolls mean better results. Earthdawn fourth edition keeps the ""talent option"" approach to Disciplines introduced in third edition, but refines the required talents at each Circle to be more broadly useful, and improves the choices available at each tier to allow for better customization options. Spellcasting has introduced a new concept--extra threads--that allow magicians to modify and enhance their spells as they cast them. These options give lower-Circle spells a longer life and more utility over the course of the character's career. The timeline has been advanced. It is a few years after the Second Theran War, and a new status quo exists in Barsaive. Throal has a new royal family on the throne, and has reduced their involvement in provincial affairs as they recover from the war. Other political powers have started expanding their influence, moving in where the dwarfs have left a void... including the Denairastas clan of Iopos. They have already claimed the city of Jerris, and look for ways to expand their influence even farther. This is a great time to get back into the game, and this project gives you access to the books we've released so far at a discount. Why not journey back to Barsaive, and build some new legends?

As children, we found the tiny details of life astounding and wonderful. I'll never forget watching caterpillars go through metamorphosis on my second-grade desk and emerge as butterflies. But that curiosity is dampened as we grow up. Darwin is a strategic game that will reawaken a sense of wonder and love for nature. The Game In Darwin, each player's goal is to evolve a species that will survive. Darwin comes with 96 adaptation cards, each with a picture and description of an organism with an incredible adaptation that helps it to survive in a hostile environment. As you play, you'll compete for scarce resources and use them to add adaptations to your species. To survive, your species will need to eat, reproduce, and avoid being eaten by other players! Whether you love out-smarting your friends in strategy games, or just enjoy discovering the wild adaptations, Darwin gives everyone a chance to have fun and learn something new. The deck contains 96 adaptation cards, 24 resource cards and 4 environment cards. Adaptations help your species to eat, reproduce, or survive, or give you a strategic advantage in managing resources. I'm working on a brand new re-design of the deck, here's a sneak peek at what it looks like: Survival and Eat adaptations (new card designs) Back in December, I collected a bunch of crazy adaptations from asknature.org and made the first iteration of the game. I created the first deck by printing on full-sheet labels, cutting them out, and sticking them to a deck of Bicycle cards. It was a Christmas present for my family. This is what it looked like: The first home-made edition Since then, I've play-tested the game with many different groups of friends and family, and though the deck looks similar the game play has evolved dramatically. Thanks to the input from many testers, Darwin is now a highly strategic game as well as being fun and educational. Darwin as an Education Tool Darwin is a great educational tool that combines fun game play with high-level thinking: how will your species combine evolutionary traits and strategies to survive? How will you collect and manage resources in a changing environment? How will you adapt when other species begin to develop predatory strategies? In playing Darwin, learning about amazing adaptations is just the beginning of the educational experience. Playing the game will spark curiosity and excitement about life's strategies, and how to reflect them in our own problem solving. Even without playing the game, the Darwin deck provides a rich source of inspiration for any number of activities whether you are learning engineering biomimicry, mathematics, evolutionary biology, ecology, economics, or almost anything! Life's solutions are often more elegant, efficient, and sustainable than humanity's best efforts: we have a lot to learn, and Darwin provides fun entry point into the wonders of the natural world. Funds, Production, and Stretch Goals I'm planning to have Darwin professionally printed by makeplayingcards.com. I have already researched the adaptations and designed the deck. If I can reach my Kickstarter goal of $2000, I can produce 100 copies of Darwin and send them out to the funders. If I reach $5000, I will be able to upgrade to a higher card quality from the printer. About Me Hi, I'm Sam. I love hands on projects and spending time in nature. I'm fascinated by biomimicry: taking inspiration from nature in order to design better products and services. I just graduated from Penn State with my Masters in Engineering Design, and this summer I will be working in the National Parks for Leave No Trace center for outdoor ethics. I originally made this game as a Christmas present for my family back in December. I was surprised that people really enjoyed playing it, and decided I wanted to get Darwin into more people's hands. The goal of this project is to give people a fun reminder of how awesome nature is, and why it's worth protecting. Thank you for supporting the project!"

We will be the smallest brewery in Anchorage and the first brewery to open in Midtown. Starting small allows us to create an inviting, friendly gathering space to enjoy a beer while you plan your next adventure or celebrate your latest one with strangers and friends alike. As a professional mountain guide and a rock climber, we are both passionate about the outdoors, new adventure and good beer. We want to create a place in Anchorage that is somewhere people can share their love for adventure and beer with others. In climbing, �onsite� means to finish a climb the first time you try it. This term was the ideal name for our brewery since we wanted it to be inspired by our joint dedication to the climbing community. It will be our first venture in running our own business and we are starting so small that we will mainly sell our beer for onsite consumption in the tasting room. Our location near the local climbing gym and REI is the perfect space to start our small climbing/adventure-inspired brewery. To begin we are going to be small, but over time we will grow and improve our space into something great! Ultimately, we love making great beer, are good at it and find joy in others drinking what we spend a lot of time and energy creating. We want to start a successful, community-focused Alaskan business, in an industry we are both passionate about, in the place we call home. How did the dream begin? As a professional mountain guide and a competitive gym climber, we bonded over our passion for climbing and a constant desire for new adventures. When we met we realized we needed a joint hobby to do when Tom was off the mountain and Amber was having rest days from rock climbing. This is when we began brewing, since we both loved good beer. Over the past 6+ years, this pastime has turned into a profession. Our beers have placed in homebrew competitions in Washington and Alaska. Together we want to succeed in the brewing industry in the same way we have both succeeded with our recent climbing ambitions. Our dream is Onsite Brewing Company! What are we going to brew? The beauty of being a small brewing system is that we can experiment and frequently rotate our beers on tap so there can always be something new for everyone to taste. We are especially proud of our seasonal Sitka Spruce juicy IPA, and our delicious Brut/champagne pale ale. We would also like to be one of the only breweries with a choice of lower alcohol percentage but delicious full flavored beer. What's in it for you? We want to get you the first set of Onsite Brewing Company Swag!

Reward #13 ($5,000) - Help us grow and name your own unitank! What's the timeline? We have most of permits but are waiting for the final ones through the local government. This should be done by early June. Once we have this, we can start brewing! Good beer takes time... If all goes to plan with permitting and brewing, we hope to be open in early-mid July! As we work our way through the rest of the process, we will keep everyone in the loop! Coming up, we have an assembly meeting on April 23rd for our state liquor license and another one June 4th for our special land use permit for alcohol business. (Yes it all really is as confusing and boring as it sounds but we are almost done! The summit is in sight and we are ready to enjoy a delicious summit beer once we finish this last slog to the top of the permitting mountain!!) Why we need the funds? We have learned a lot during this adventure of opening a brewery. We have also accomplished a lot, especially with raising our start-up capital, finding a location, and the permitting process (which is time-consuming and challenging, to say the least). But we did it (mostly)! We are just waiting on our Municipal permits to be approved. We just need a little bit more financial help to aid in offsetting the final taproom costs. The cost of getting our local permits was drastically higher than anticipated and has put us under a budget crunch. We need your help! Who are we? Amber is a driven rock climber who bartended through college and loves beer and the craft brewing scene which is what prompted her to get into the brewing industry. In early 2017, she was offered a job that relocated us to Anchorage; this offer was well timed since we were looking to leave the Seattle Area and move to Alaska! While in Anchorage, Amber worked part-time at Anchorage Brewing Company as a barkeep to create connections in the local beer community; this is in addition to her full-time job with the Municipality. She keeps up her big kid job to support her climbing habit and help fund the dream of Onsite Brewing Company! Tom is from England and grew up dreaming of being a mountain guide and leading climbers up the tallest and most remote peaks in the world. After moving to the United States at 18, he was able to make this dream a reality and also became a US citizen. Years of hard work and determination resulted in Tom having a successful professional mountain climbing career, for one of the most prestigious climbing services in the world. He has been leading expeditions and instructing globally for over 10 years now. Highlights include 1 expedition and summit of Mt Vinson (Antarctica), 22 summits of Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), 13 summits of Aconcagua (Argentina), 7 summits of Denali (Alaska), 2 summits of Mount Fairweather (Alaska), 34 Rainier climbs (Washington). He loves working hard, learning new skills, and helping others succeed in achieving their goals. He has guided and lead hundreds of clients from all walks of life including professional climbers, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, television crews, large charity groups, and training members of the U.S Special Forces. He is now ready to transition from helping others succeed at achieving their climbing goals, to pursuing our goal of a great adventure-inspired brewery."

So far we've gotten 12 Issues set up and ready to produce but just like everything, funding is our main issue. In addition, even though we have the first 12 Issues, the story is far larger in scale and will continue on for many seasons afterwards if not longer than that. This will be a story we'll be releasing for many years to come. We're even hoping it'll eventually become an animated series, video game, card and board games with a list that keeps on growing. Of course that's all stuff to think about in the coming future, we need to take it one step at a time. So what might that be? Gathering a good supporting base to help us become successful and gain recognition is a good start! REWARDS ALL REWARDS COME WITH A KICKSTARTER STICKER ON THE BACK OF THEM AS PROOF OF YOUR SUPPORT. Below is an example (From our Issue #1 physical copies) of what to expect for the Amber, Red and Vitus packages (It'll come inside a clear Ultra Pro Protective Case). Each Issue will come with these limited copies of signatures and won't be available once sold. You can contact us and ask to pay for the same package and number to maintain a consistent collection as we release future Issues. These package deals are meant to help fund our project while giving you the opportunity to invest in something that could be worth value later. Again, I won't be signing with these colors of sharpies other than what's offered for these packages. (This applies to each Issue we release for these packages, not just one issue) Eventually, once we begin making enough money these packages will have other addition quality added into them such as a variant front cover that will be different than the rest of the books. Example: Amber Package- 50 silver metallic signatures per Issue of Essence (35 from KS) Red Package- 100 bronze metallic signatures per Issue of Essence (80 from KS) Vitus Package - 1 white signature per Issue of Essence. Available until sold and is a first come first serve basis. You can't pay for future issues with this signature package. Here is an example of what the comic will look like with a signature. You'll either get a Bronze, Silver or White signature depending on what package you bought. Basic book signatures will not have these colors. Coloring Book INTRODUCTION TO CHARITY Charity by Ale Garza Introduction to Charity INTRODUCTION TO CONRAD Conrad by Dimitri Pantazis Introduction to Conrad PRINTS Prints STRETCH GOALS For every additional $2,000 after reaching our $3,000 goal we'll have a commissioned piece done by an artist. This is an added bonus to our current stretch goals already posted below in the hopes it'll encourage people to help us gain further funding once we're past our $3,000 goal. This not only brings extra material in the form of pictures but also helps Chris and I gain more materials to showcase. We'd also be giving back to the community by paying artists involved in the project. The more money we make, the faster we'll be able to release more content, including releasing comic book issues much faster than we currently are. WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING? All the money we receive from KS will be going back into the Essence: Destiny Of The Twelve Warriors project. We want to be able to continue bringing more materials to our fans and supporters so there's never enough support we can receive, especially with how large this project is set up to become.

It's the scariest one yet. After making two albums with one of the world's best producers (Dave Cobb), I've decided I have to make the record I need to hear. Let me back up ... a little over a year ago, my life blew up. I ended an engagement and a 10-year relationship that was falling apart. I squatted at a friend's house for 6 months, and then packed up all the stuff and moved to Nashville. It was the hardest and lowest point in my life so far. Luckily, I leaned on songwriting. I wrote to understand and I wrote to survive. I wrote some of the best songs I'll probably ever write. I thought I'd come to Nashville and find another hotshot producer or band to take my music to the next level. But what I discovered here is the power of being myself and trusting my gut. That's why I am producing this record with my longtime bandmate and co-creator Will Robertson. The album is called ""Empty Spaces."" It's about loss and redemption. It's about feeling everything. And it's about starting again. These are my favorite songs ever. But I can't do it without your help. Records are expensive to make. To be blunt, $20k isn't really enough to cover studio time, engineer, producer, musicians, mastering and duplication of CDs and Vinyl. Not to mention promotion and and marketing costs. Still, it will get us most of the way there. And that's a big deal! You can help me make this record happen by pledging whatever amount is comfortable to you! Thanks for being part of this.

I say our project because (as the title will tell you) this is round two of my Tubble Pin Pals Kickstarter project, and this here is a celebration of all those who helped me the first time around. I am so excited to be back creating Tubbles; little chubby cuties that I truly love making. This right here is Cheer Bear, our first goal to reach! This bear is just too dang cute to not be out in the front of the pack. What do we need to do to get there? Simple, raise $200 in pledges, and then we can move on to all the fun and exciting designs I have lined up. Once the first goal is reached every $200 we raise will unlock a new ""LOCKED"" design (excluding the last stretch goal listed, that one is seriously special and will require a bit more be raised to bring it to life, but oh goodness do I have my fingers crossed that we get there). Each hard enamel pin will be roughly 1.5"" tall, and I will have some with gold, some with black, some with silver, and some with my favorite, rose gold plating. I have so many special little extras that I have already been working on and producing, and some of it will go out to the early supporters only so get in there with your pledge early to make sure you don't miss out! Stickers, buttons, postcards, and originals to every person who pledges at the 3 pin level and above say what?!? Yep, when I first reached out to you all to make my little dream of turning my art into a wearable little pin I sent out a custom Tubble Pal illustration with everyone who pledged at a certain level, and even though it may kill me (that would be a good problem believe me) I want to do that all over again. I've been so lucky over the past three years to have your support, and this is one of the ways I plan to say thank you. I created a lot of new designs this time around, but I wanted to make sure to really pay tribute to the first project by bringing back a few of the designs we created then. They are revamped, reworked, and revitalized I hope you love them even more this time around. Cheer Bear Tubble Pal. 1.5"" Rose Gold. UNLOCKED To everybody that's been here with me from the get, thank you for keeping up with me, and following my journey. This project is dedicated to you all, I would not be doing this without you. You all helped me create my first enamel pins over three years ago, and it is high time we bring some more Tubble Pin Pals to life. Stretch Goals. I have many stretch goals in store, and many designs to pick from once we reach our first goal. Keeping that in mind, if you see a design you are excited about that is not yet unlocked, pledge anyway, you can always cancel your pledge if your favorite does not get unlocked. The more people who pledge the more designs will be unlocked and the more awesome pins we will be able to create. $400 Pretty accurate representation of how I see myself.

Why Kickstarter, and how will this all work. I like the idea of us all being involved in making something, it is collaborative, and helps keep things fresh. I also enjoy the all or nothing approach this platform has. If we don't hit our goal, small though it may be, we do not get the funds, and you are not charged. Through funding each of these pins here, I know that I can make the best product possible, and the more funds raised, the more stuff we can add. I have still yet to release a pin with glitter, and I would love to do that, something that would be made possible through direct funding like this. Most of the funds will go to get the pins made, like a staggering amount 70% or more depending on how the final pins work out, the rest of the funds will be used to create backing cards, buy shipping material (every reward will come in a thick bubble mailer, bigger rewards will need to ship in a box) around 20%, paying Kickstarter fees 10%, anything at all left over will go towards making even more rewards and extra goodies! You will not be charged until the day our project's campaign ends, and only if we reach our goal. You can cancel your pledge at any time. Project Schedule: May 16th to June 9th - Kickstarter campaign time! We have 25 days to raise these funds. Once the project is over and fully funded surveys to get everything in order for shipping and such will be sent out. Please please please make sure you have your address entered correctly, this will help make sure your rewards arrive in a timely manner, and due to the nature of some of the items they will not be able to be replaced. June 9th to June 25th - Funds (minus fees and so on) will transfer somewhere in this stretch to me so things can get goin! Late June - Pin production begins. Early to Mid July - Pins and all other rewards will ship out.*As the project progresses I will continue to update the time frames of each step of the process.

I'm raising funds to bring my new show to peoples homes across the rural American West by horseback. This August I plan to depart and travel 3,000 miles with 2 horses over 14 months. Traveling by horse, moving through wilderness, dipping into small communities, living in a daily practice of putting my animals needs before mine will inescapably have a massive effect on how the show changes and how I change. As an artist and as a person who believes that curiosity is an essential practice in building a better world, I think traveling songs by horse will be a powerful way to share what I have with others and invite them to share with me. Soup and Troubador with Long Canyon in the background. I want to keep making new work that surprises my audiences and surprises myself. I want to make new work and deliver it in new vessels. I love eclectic performance, shows that continually subvert your expectations and repeatedly bring you to new plateaus of sound, or fun, or depth, or questions, or catharsis or productive discomfort. I feel comfortable in so many ways on stage now and I want to keep pushing myself to feel uncomfortable in new ways. That's an artists job right? To bang their head against the wall in search of something meaningful, something beautiful, something truthful to share with their audience. This tour is really two shows moving in tandem, the performances and the travel. They are in equal measure what I'll be sharing. I want to be raw and honest in my show and in how I communicate what I'm experiencing on the journey. Hardship, woe, discomfort, emotional and spiritual exhaustion are all things I'm expecting. That's part of the appeal. What is there to mine outside the comfort of the life I know? I ask this question and choose this experience with tremendous privileges as a white heterosexual man from New York City with a loving supportive family and community. Questions about those privileges will be part of the constellation of experience as I move through rural America. I've gathered over 3,000 potential host contacts in 83 countries all by referral from audience members written on maps after shows. Audiences have filled 28 maps and I organize the contacts in spread sheets. Now I need lots more possible hosts along my route. Finding new homes Going into peoples homes, trusting I can find homes, trusting my network to reach out to their cousins and colleagues and exes and pastors and shepherds and dentists and DJs to find me homes, trusting that I'll meet interested hospitable strangers along the way is a mode of faith. It's a faith supported by the experience of arriving at over 600 mostly strangers homes to be greeted with warmth, kindness and curiosity. Hosts in Te Pahu New Zealand 2012 Tokyo hosts enamored with my song typewriter Minneapolis host who gave me his accordion that he used to win polka competitions with as a child. Inside scoop - dogs do chase mailmen. In this time where we see ourselves as remarkably divided, traveling by horse could be a great inroad to a conversation. It can inspire an invitation or a conversation where there might not have been one. I've met thousands of people playing in homes, all different kinds, but I'm trusting the horse element can help me find different people than my networks would normally connect me to. The horse tour is an opportunity to reach all types of new populations and communities in mostly new regions for me. The hope is to use that new reality expansively to give access to folks who are often missed on my more city based tours. Learning to trim the feet. Working with a rasp here with my first horse mentor in New Zealand Stephen. Stephen previously hosted my show in 2012 then horse tutored me in 2017. What's this money for? Over the last six months I have raised just under half my budget from previous hosts, audience members, supporters of past projects and received a grant from The Speranza Foundation. That has allowed me to purchase a considerable amount of gear, continue learning and living in Boulder Utah while working on my show. Right now I'm reaching out to my larger network for the remaining necessities.... 2 horses (whom you will soon meet) $10,000' Vet services $2,000 Ferrier services $2,500 Supplemental feed for the horses $8,000 Permits $1,000 Press Person (PR) $3,000 to get features and stories about the trip in areas I�m heading towards so potential hosts can find me easily. This way its not just me always finding them. Human food $6,500 TOTAL $33,000 The route and the plan (the broad version) Aside from funding I'll be asking my network for any and all connections to potentially interested hosts along the route. The route will be taking me down the Continental Divide Trail through Colorado and New Mexico, cutting across Arizona through the Mogollon Rim and the Tonto Forest, linking with the Pacific Crest Trail in Southern California and traveling north on the PCT through Oregon then cutting across Idaho to conclude in Yellowstone or Missoula MT in fall of 2020. I'll be sharing more about the route during the campaign. The very nature of horse travel is one of shifting plans so parts of the route will change throughout the trip. Long Riders run into big trouble when they have a fixed plan and make choices according to it. Flexibility is an absolute necessity. This proves a huge challenge for setting up shows while on the trail. The system is to find interested parties within reasonable distance of the route, give them a large window of when I could get to them, stay in touch, and as I approach, continue to narrow that window. Hosts are pots of gold at the end of the rainbows. The horses are the rainbows and I am..... the trail? You know what I mean! Where am I now? In July of 2018 I moved to be based in Boulder Utah a town of 300 people where I had met stupendous cowboys, horse people and wilderness folk years ago on tour. I found this tiny extraordinary place cause someone put it on my map. Over the last year they have become my friends, mentors, teachers and high counsel guiding me on my preparation. It's been grand to learn so much new information, to continuously be a student immersed in new languages and physical/emotional challenges. I don't feel I'm a naturally great student. It's something I desperately want to be good at and this process is pushing me towards it. Learning how to ride, pack, take care of horses, camp with horses, tend to all their needs has been a slow process and it's one I am currently in the middle of. It has required a level of patience, maturity and thoughtfulness that are not a part of my natural demeanor. I am in a world of new. It's beautiful, exhausting, illuminating and comes with lots of sore muscles and occasional bouts of overwhelming anxiety. Every day I wake up and start productively failing. At the end of each day I see I'm a bit closer, a bit smarter, a bit more capable of doing this thing. Riding starts with one horse, then leading a horse, then leading a horse with a pack saddle, then leading with a loaded pack saddle, then an overnight, then multiple nights, then multiple multiple nights. Regularly finding sufficient feed and water on the trail are two of the biggest challenges. Driven by curiosity In the process of preparing for this trip I've made some dear friends with people I disagree with on a great many issues, probably most of the issues that are at the top of the American zeitgeist right now. We forged a connection through working with horses, eating food, asking about each others history and what the other was excited about. That gave us a foundation of respect and understanding where I now feel we could talk about anything with curiosity for the others experience rather than reducing them to their stance on an issue. It's been a great lesson and reminder in what makes a person and the kinds of connections I value. I believe deeply in complexity. I think we all have complicated stories that brought us to where we are. I want to stay curious and get curiouser about all people. I think curiosity can be contagious as can fear. I choose the former and will carry that ethos with me as I move through different communities. But really, why do this? I did not grow up with horses or in the wilderness. It's hard and new. Forces me to slow down and think. There is very little space for ego in this learning process and I feel more open to all deeper knowledge and criticism. It's forced me to think less like a person and more like a horse. I'm looking forward to more of that. Being a person has its limits. How hard this is and what kind of hard is what drew me to this endeavor and what keeps me in it. I've spent a lot of life trying to have good experiences or comfortable ones. I'd like to be interested in meaningful experiences above the rest. REWARDS! The reward this project really produces is being a part of this journey and experiencing it with me. Also offering some other fun things I made. Here are a few pictures of Tour Tea towels you could choose from in the rewards and a physical copy of my debut album. In 2020 ill be printing my second album Glitterbones Bargain to vinyl and will make that available to my kickstarter backers first!

At times, they plunged into the path of the sun in the green-blue ocean and opened their mouths and drank the gold.� � Pat O�Shea, The Hounds of the Morrigan  From Upstate New York, Oona Grady, vocals/fiddle/viola, and James Gascoyne, vocals/guitar/banjo, play and sing North Atlantic dance tunes and folk songs. Steeped in Irish music for as far back as she can remember, Oona spent many years living in Cork, Ireland, where she honed her skills as a fiddle player and Irish music specialist. Upon moving back to her hometown of Ithaca, NY, Oona immersed herself in the local traditional music scene and incorporated old time and Cajun tunes into her repertoire. Growing up outside Louisville, KY, James was surrounded by music from an early age; radio, vinyl records, church music, and live concerts were a part of daily life. Finding his own musical style as an adult, James always keeps his ears open for sounds � new, old, familiar, or strange. While singing and playing guitar and banjo with Drank The Gold, he delves into the traditions of American old time and Irish dance tunes, while keeping true to his borderless, experimental musical roots. Now based in Saratoga Springs, NY, Oona and James collaborate as Drank The Gold, bringing new perspectives and innovative arrangements to the music they love. Craic agus ceol (good times and music)! our first photo shoot! ...the project: Sipped The Silver... In March of this year we traveled to Oona's hometown of Ithaca, NY, and recorded an album's worth of material over two days. It was an intense and focused time, but the once the recording gear was set up, the music bubbled out of us! These are tunes and songs that we have been playing over the past months and years, honing the arrangements and locking into a groove. We traveled back to Ithaca the following month to do a day of mixing, and have spent the subsequent months coordinating all the other details involved in producing an album (more on that below). We chose Sipped The Silver as the title for this project in reference to the quote above - the same quote where we got our band name. A bit obscure, but we like the ambiguity and the poetry of it! ...the space: Electric Wilburland... We have been really lucky to work with Will Russell at Electric Wilburland in Newfield, NY (a small town outside of Ithaca). The studio is situated in an old church next to the oldest covered bridge still in use in New York State. A beautiful and serene and inspiring space - good vibes abound! We tried setting up in a few different spots, and eventually chose this corner up on the stage. We sat facing each other and played without headphones, as if we were in our own living room! Will set up the microphones with care to pick up the best sound possible, yet not disturbing our performance. THE ROOM at Electric Wilburland ...the material: Twelve Tracks... We played some of our favorite tunes and songs, two or three takes each, choosing the next piece organically, following the flow. In the end, we found ourselves with twelve tracks that we feel represent our current work as a band. Our main source of inspiration is various North Atlantic fiddle and folk music traditions, especially Irish and Appalachian old time music. Some tunes came out sounding somewhat similar to how we learned them, with simple duet arrangements. James wrote four of the tracks, and we worked up arrangements on fiddle/viola and banjo. And the rest of the music falls somewhere in that beautiful grey area between traditional and original! A couple of sneak peaks: James ""ruined"" a set of Irish jigs by playing them in a different time signature on the banjo; he also adjusted the feel of an Irish song by playing it on the banjo. {insert banjo joke here!} And Oona experimented with the mode of an Irish reel, dramatically changing the mood to suit the title. Though the material comes from many disparate sources, we can't help but play it sounding like us, putting our Drank The Gold stamp on it. the view from the control room ...the people involved: an amazing crew... We have been supported from start to finish by experts in their fields! Will Russell (engineering and mixing) is a grammy winning engineer who has made this process feel ""easy"" from start to finish. Dana Billings mastered the album beautifully, taking our requests and nailing them on the first try. Elizabeth Pedinotti Haynes took so many gorgeous (and flattering!) photos of us during our photo shoot that we agonized for hours trying to choose which ones to use. Mike O'Donnell has taken the graphic design to the next level, while also being positive and encouraging about our own graphic contributions. And, last but not least, Pat Burke has shepherded this project to completion, offering trusted advice and insight into the business of music making. We are so proud of this album, and of all that these folks have done to help make it great! Electric Wilburland ...how you can help: action steps... We appreciate all of the support we have already received over the years, from the venues that have hired us, to our families, and of course to everyone who has enjoyed our music! THANK YOU! Have a look at the pledge rewards and see what appeals: first and foremost, we'd love for you to use this Kickstarter campaign as a way to PRE-ORDER THE NEW ALBUM - get the CD if you still have a player, or even if you don't (it includes beautiful album art + a DTG designed sticker: keep it on your coffee table!). If you have gone purely digital, we have that option too. If you are able to give a larger pledge, we have a lot of options: support Oona's newfound obsession with block printing by ordering a set of cards or a t-shirt; sign up for a lesson with one or both of us; or get James to write you a tune. Last but not least, we'd absolutely love to come and play a house concert for you in your living room with all of your favorite friends! However you are able to help us along the way to making this project a reality, thank you! Like we said above, the music is recorded and we're very proud of it, and can't wait to share it with the world! the album cover image!"

The dragons and cats need a new friend, and the first one to hatch is a fox. Why a fox? Voting at conventions and through social media has shown that you want a fox next. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What's the fox like? Super soft and cuddly, this winged fox can't wait to meet you! Big feet, giant ears, super soft, long fabric, and a heart on her chest, she is ready for cuddles. She is baby-safe, since she has embroidered eyes and integrated (not jointed) legs. They still move since they are extra floppy, so she still ""sits"" and ""stands"" (with your help). She's 8 inches sitting, 10 inches standing. She's been designed so that accessories for the dragons will fit her. So -- your hats, scarves, cloaks, and pins will still fit your new dragon fox. Fox has squinty eyes and whiskers! A fox with open eyes may be added at a later date, but for now we are making the closed eyed fox. Thank you for your votes! --------------------------------------------------------------- What about the money? Funding Goals: Basics: Initial Goal: $2880 This breaks down to: $1900 for production $380 for Kickstarter, Backerkit & credit card processing fees $300 Safety Testing $300 Mailing Supplies For you visual people (like me!) here's a chart of how it breaks down. Funding for the campaign is entirely for production of the animals, safety testing, shipping supplies for Kickstarter rewards, and Kickstarter/Backerkit/credit card processing fees. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALL BACKERS will be charged shipping after the campaign ends. You will get a survey through Backerkit, and will be charged the actual amount of postage for your items and any add-ons. Can I back the campaign if I'm outside the US? (International shipping?) I love international backers, but I found postage, customs, and shipping to be much more complicated (and expensive) than I anticipated. If you are international and you'd like to back, here's how it will work. International backers have ONE tier they are able to pledge through (INTERNATIONAL - Two Friends) You will be charged the actual amount of shipping once the campaign ends. Keep in mind there are customs fees as well, which can be unexpectedly high. These customs fees are entirely your responsibility. If any international package is returned to me, you will be responsible for the entire cost of shipping it back to you. ----------------------------------------------------------- You can add on to your pledge in two ways: 1) DURING the campaign: Click ""Manage Pledge,"" then add on the dollar amount(s) for the items you want to add. 2) AFTER the campaign: Select your add-on items in the Backerkit Survey after the project closes. --------------Animals------------------------------------------------- $25 per fox OR BUNNY $10 per Tiny Dragon (specify color: teal, purple, green) $40 Dragon (specify color, I'll post some photos for you to choose from) $75 Handmade Custom Color Dragon (you choose colors) -------------- Accessories-------------------------------------------- $4 Bow Tie or Flower (random color) $5 Tiny Hat and Bow Tie (for Tiny Dragon) $12 Cloak (non-house color OR house color - Yellow, Blue, Green, Red) $10 Wizard Scarf + Pin (specify house - Badger, Raven, Snake, Lion) $10 Hat (specify style - Wizard, Knight, Unicorn, Cunning, Rainbow) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are you doing stretch goals? Yes! These were one of our favorite parts about our first campaign, with weigh-in and backing from all of you, we were able to make all the rewards so much bigger and better. What are the stretch goals? ------------------------------------------------------------ I'VE UNLOCKED THE BUNNY...... if you'd like one, add $25 to your pledge! Also unlocked... 5x7 Prints AND fox stickers for everyone with a physical reward! One of each will be included with your rewards, and each will also be available as add-ons. We've unlocked the tiny fox! One of these will also be included with your rewards if you've pledged for a physical reward. -------------------------------------------------------------- Anything we raise past our stretch goals will help me recoup costs from the bunnies! ------------------------------------------------------------------- Photos of the bunny? What do they look like together? Dragon, Bunny and Fox! Here are better photos of the bunny! I tried to get them from all angles and give you a sense of the movement of the ears and the wings. I hope it helps! ---------------------------------------------------------------- Could there be more stretch goals? Yes! Further stretch goals could be added, possibly including: new animal design development and/or production designs of stickers and/or enamel pins in dragon and fox or bunny styles new colors (voted on, of course!) of foxes or bunnies tiny versions of the animals more colors and/or materials for future production accessories You'll be updated as we go! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As in my previous Kickstarter, if we reach any of the Stretch Goals, ALL backers will receive the Stretch Goal items. If we reach any of the goals, everyone with a physical reward will get one of each stretch goal reward for no additional cost! Everyone at level ""B"" or above gets one (of each item) from any stretch goals we reach! For example, if we reach our second stretch goal and are able to get the stickers made, you'll get one of those with your reward too, for no additional charge to you. If we unlock the tiny fox, you will get one of those too! -------------------Stretch Goal Add-Ons----------------------- If we unlock anything, you will be able to add more of the new items to your order, either through ""manage pledge"" and adding on the cost of the item while the campaign is live, or through the Backerkit survey at the end of the campaign. --------------------------------------------------------------- As with our previous campaign, if you share our campaign on any social media platform (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc) you will get a special extra reward! So please, share away!! ------------------------------------------------------------------ I love to hear from you! Send me a message or comment anytime! Thank you for being involved. --------------------------------------------------------------------"

Are you a lesbian? Do you just want to buy a sword in the colors of the lesbian flag? I have great news for you! These pins were inspired by my love of weaponry and my love of women, and in the hopes that other lesbians feeling neglected by merchandise during pride month can see themselves recognized by a product catering directly to them. I hope you all enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them! The specs are as follows: Each pin is 2"" long (50.8 mm) at its longest point, hard enamel with shiny gold metal representing one of the oranges of the pride flag. They will have two locking clasps for security,and an equally cool looking backing card comes along with them. There are three initial designs for the funding goal: Rapier Longsword Katana These are automatically unlocked with full funding of the campaign! Those aren't all! If we hit all our stretch goals, three additional pins will be unlocked. These include: Greatsword Khopesh Zweihander All designs that are successfully unlocked will be available for you to choose from once the campaign has been completed via a survey that is sent out. UPDATE: I'm happy to announce our next series of stretch goals: Sapphic Swords! These swords were inspired by a Medium article that proposed a new lesbian flag, made with colors mentioned in poetry by Sappho. While the orange and pink seems to be the most recognized flag, I understand why some people may be uncomfortable with its' origins as a descendant of the pink flag, so I'm so pleased to be able to provide this option. For the Sapphic Swords, the stretch goals start with the Rapier, Longsword, and Katana- if we unlock all three of these, I'll unveil the Greatsword, Khopesh, and Zweihander in these colors as well! Thank you all so much for your continued support. Finally, please be aware that these are mostly final, but some small changes may occur when they're sent off to the supplier in order to make the best pins I can for you. Thanks for understanding!

Hands were an evolutionary leap that developed with our brains as we became bipedal, and which led to tool use and all the other technologies of civilization.

Squonk�s original music, on bass and drums, guitar and wind synth, keyboards and bagpipes, will drive a journey that we hope will be spectacular, plaintive, and comic as the band runs head to head into these overwhelming hands of fate. Hand to Hand will be propelled by our instinct to create timely and boisterous music spectacle for the public space, free and accessible to all.

Why not? Comes with some great perks. Of course, she has no intention of reforming� with these powers? Are you kidding?!� it's just sometimes there's no better place to hide than in plain sight. IMPOSSIBLE, you say? EXACTLY! Imagine Harley Quinn meets Plastic Man in the Marvel Universe with a little Dick Tracy thrown in. Kind of. That's IMPOSSIBLE JONES! IMP in her native habitat. I first thought of IMPOSSIBLE JONES as a monthly comic� but the first ""issue"" became 27 epic pages, so now it's a 132-page (or more!) Graphic Novel collecting what would have been the first 5 ""issues"" of her comic� the irrepressible Imp's entire Origin Story! And IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY isn't just any graphic novel, but an Ultra-Cool Collector's Edition Graphic Novel! Working design only. But still� pretty cool! HARDCOVER! OVERSIZED!

Support this project and you get the whole story in UPDATE #1� for Backers only! The amusing-if-somewhat-morally-ambiguous adventures of IMPOSSIBLE JONES are brought to you by: Karl loves his job far more than he has any right to. He has written, inked, and occasionally penciled: Superman, Superboy, Harley Quinn, Spider-man, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Four, Captain America and many others� although he has an inexplicable fondness for obscure characters no one else remembers. His current obsessions are his creator-owned comics with Tom Grummett� SECTION ZERO� and David Hahn� IMPOSSIBLE JONES (you may have heard of her)! Waiting in the wings: SAINT MAYHEM! Karl lives in Portland, Oregon with his wonderful wife Myrna, their energetic son Isaac, and cute-as-a-bug daughter Eliza. He really can�t complain about much. David's work is decidedly contemporary and reflects his eye for crisp detail. He has illustrated Marvel's Spider-man Loves Mary Jane, and Marvel Adventures: The Fantastic Four, DC's Batman �66 Meets Wonder Woman �77, and Vertigo's Bite Club, Fables, and Lucifer, as well as The Batman Handbook. David was nominated for both an Eisner Award and an Ignatz Award for his creator-owned comic series Private Beach, published by Slave Labor Graphics. An avid � who loves video games, David has somehow found himself living in bear and cougar country in the backwoods of western Montana. AIDING AND ABETTING THESE TWO: Tony Avina� an American comic book colorist. Born and raised in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, he began his career working for Wildstorm Production in 2001. Since then he�s worked for DC Comics, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse and Dynamite Entertainment. Some of his notable projects are The Boys, Happy, Sleeper, Richard Dragon, Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay and Batman �66 Meets the Green Hornet. ALSO: The crafty COMICRAFT gang on letters. No, the book is not done. The first chapter/issue is totally complete. The second chapter/issue only has letters, colors and some inks left to finish. There are still three more chapters/issues to produce. With your support, David and I are confident we can finish that over the next handful of months. But to make the wait a little easier, we do have some lovely Reward Levels to offer you� YOU GIVE. WE GIVE BACK. ONLY FAIR. I will hand-deliver these to any shop within *REASONABLE* driving distance of Portland, Oregon. So for those lucky ducks: NO POSTAGE! NOTE: Both books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY has been printed. NOTE: All three books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY and SECTION ZERO 1959 have been printed. YOU IN THE SPOTLIGHT! AWESOME ART OPPORTUNITIES! Here's where things get fun(ner). Stretch Goals will alternate between something that makes the book better� spot gloss on cover, full color endsheets, etc.� and something for everyone who has pledged at THE GOODS� BUT BETTER! level or above� trading cards, stickers, cloisonne pins, etc. So the more money raised, the more cool stuff you get� at no extra cost to you! (As long as you've pledged at THE GOODS� BUT BETTER! level or above.) It is impossible to show how much coolness spot gloss adds to a book's cover. For an Ultra-Cool Collector's Edition, it's a gotta-have. Given Imp's uncanny ability to alter her appearance, Paper Dolls are a natural!

NOTE: Until actually unlocked, all Stretch Goals may be changed or modified as new, cooler ideas come to me! If you followed my SECTION ZERO campaigns, you know I vowed to get a tattoo to commemorate every successful Kickstarter I run. I stand by that vow! I now have two SECTION ZERO tatts, and would love� LOVE!� to add one for IMPOSSIBLE JONES. Only YOU can make that possible. Only YOU can get me to decorate (or desecrate, depending on your view) my body� by getting IMPOSSIBLE JONES funded! Whatever ends up on my arm (or leg) is in your hands! (So to speak.) First: DON'T PANIC! Approximate postage costs will be: UNITED STATES: $8 CANADA: $15 THE REST OF THE WORLD: $25 Fingers crossed, those numbers won't change much. Postage will be charged after the campaign ends, when the survey goes out and we know exactly how much it will cost. This way we don't end up with an under-estimated postal bill that cripples us, and you don't end up with an over-inflated postage charge based on assumptions and guesses. Our surveys will be handled by BACKERKIT, who has done this many, many times before. The process is simple, safe, and painless. You will be glad we're doing it this way. Trust us. Truly and sincerely, I am constantly amazed and humbled by the power of people like you to make, well, the impossible possible. Making comics� and specifically making creator-owned comics like IMPOSSIBLE JONES� is what I want to do most in the world, but I can't do it without you. It doesn't even exist without you, without your support and belief. Thank you for that, and so much more. Thank you for BELIEVING IN IMPOSSIBLE.

In the 15 years since we first met in the faraway Siberian city of Chita (just north of Mongolia), Igor has been producing beautiful, profound paintings focused on mystical themes. To view an exhibition of his work is to journey to another world�a realm of enigma and dreams, of soulfulness and peace. Now, he turns to you, the Kickstarter public, to seek your help in creating an installation that will combine his incredible canvases with music, video and�in what might be a world�s first for art exhibitions�a stunning collection of fine jewelry themed to the elegant and soaring motifs of his paintings. It is with great pleasure that I now share the wonder that is Igor Eliseev with all of you. Michael Shipley You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 ""Moonlight Kiss"" 100 x 100 cm. My name is Igor Eliseev and I am an artist. My art is an expression of my inner world. I listen to glorious chill-out music while I create and my paramount goal is to convey that same emotional experience to my audience with the help of large, beautiful canvases and inspirational multi-media installations. I have staged numerous solo exhibitions and art projects, both locally and internationally. Each has been a conceptual event depicting profound ideas, subtle meaning, and timeless values. I have done work for high-profile art fairs and prestigious events organized by museums, foundations, and government agencies. My work has been acknowledged in various art publications and specialized magazines reviewed by famous art critics. Now I hope to create an art project combining all my concepts in one space and spanning a range of media�from painting to jewelry and from striking images to subtle and entrancing sounds. 1. The project is currently under development. I have more than 20 completed paintings from current and previous collections. In this spirit, I have created a series of paintings with such titles as �The Sands of Time,� �Magic Carpets,� �Domes of Heaven,� and �Magic Geometry.�. Work on this series continues and more canvases may yet take shape. The project will feature both these original works and those that I plan to create. In all, I plan to have 60 large-size oil paintings on display. 2. The project will be accompanied by a detailed description of all my philosophical concepts that form the basis of my work. I want to use the services of experienced writers and art critics who will review the project and convey my thoughts in the correct form. 3. While painting �Domes of Heaven� and �Magic Geometry,� it occurred to me to create a jewelry collection using the same motif. This was, in a sense, inevitable: while studying ornate Arab patterns and designs to transform them into works of art on my canvas, I also began developing a clear vision of these future articles of jewelry. Each is a study in form, in mystery and grace. The next step will be to realize these creations in gold, diamonds and precious stones. The first collection, called �Sultans of the Sky,� will include more than 30 nique and elegant pieces of jewelry. 4. An important part of the project is a marketing kit. This will include a catalogue of the jewelry and paintings and an USB flash drive in a gift box (containing the above catalogues), providing a window into my private art gallery as well as a glimpse into my audio-video art installations. 5. The design studio will be able to start creative work on the project and development of the website once 75% of the preparatory work is complete. 6. The project will use the special chill-out music of famed composer Michael E. Frith. 7. We will finalize the project by inviting guests of honor from the private and public sectors to attend a public opening ceremony. We will also stage public presentations at prestigious art platforms in museums and galleries around the globe. I believe this project will benefit the art community and have a positive cultural impact on each area where it is held. You will be welcome to see the progress in person, through studio visits at any time, at the Bodrum studio in Turkey. There, I am once found inspiration, which became endless since I had the privilege to start working there. At the studio will be made all the works of the art project. The studio is part of a large house where my the best sponsors would be hosted.

"" Golden Light In Treasury "" Magic Revelation As a child I was fascinated by the magical Arabian tales�stories of flying carpets and genies living in lamps. In my imagination, I traveled with a caravan of camels carrying immeasurable treasure across the vast desert. The animals were beautiful in their slow and rhythmic movements and time seemed to stand still over the scene. The dunes and desert mirages carried me away on a long and fanciful journey. It seemed as though the stars dotting the heavens had so much they could tell me if only I listened�not to their words, but to their radiance. Then, on my first visit to Turkey some years ago, I re-experienced those feelings from distant childhood, when my world had been filled with fairy tales of the Middle East. I saw in the night sky all the same stars that shone upon me in childhood. Again, it felt as though their radiance carried a message, something important they wanted to say. This time, though, I was more attentive and I had a clear sense now was the time to listen�and hear. I will never forget this revelation because it changed my life. From that moment on, I was able to discover that which was hidden, uncover the secrets of this visible world and discern what is normally hidden from sight. I began seeing many things in new ways, with new eyes. My subsequent work depicted these insights, these attempts to make visible that which was unseen. My work took on deeper meaning: my feelings became my guide. I had only to find a story, a structure�in the same way a rough diamond needs careful shaping to become a precious gem. Each facet of such a diamond must reflect the visible world, while the invisible must shine out from within. Igor Eliseev "" The Cheetah "" ""The Pearl"" 100 x 60 cm.

Paul and Victoria from I See Hawks in L.A. first met Peter and Gabi from The Good Intentions at a house party in Sierra Madre, CA, hosted by singer/writer Bliss Bowen. The Liverpool folk duo were on their first tour of the USA, and their English accents and timeless tunes charmed and impressed the Americans. Soon, the Hawks and Intentions were good friends. Over the years and several shared stages, from Peter and Gabi's house concerts in Liverpool to rocking Pappy & Harriet's nights in the desert, the friendship suggested a songwriting endeavor. One evening in Rob's Highland Park garage studio, Rob, Paul L and Peter sat down with guitars and some trepidation, suddenly out of their comfort zones, but came up with the beginnings of ""White Cross"" and ""Rolling The Boxcars"" amidst much fun and laughter and the chaos of the Waller children. After this promising start and the Liverpudlians' return to Liverpool, the songwriting process migrated to the cold digital theater of email--lyrics and mp3s bouncing back and forth the Atlantic by the hundreds, nestled amidst internet spams and bank statements. The challenge of creating heartfelt folk songs through cyber connection was not lost on any of us. As the email threads mushroomed, the Hawks and Good Intentions discovered the subtle and at times gaping differences between English and American musical sensibilities, phrases and idioms, as well as quirks (defects?) in their own personalities and hardened songwriting habits. Both groups shared an appreciation for nuanced shadings; and tiny but dire quibbles on a single word or phrase accompanied every stanza. These heated if wit-defused discussions became a deep learning experience for all involved, including Hawks bassist Paul Marshall and drummer Victoria Jacobs. What emerged was a song crafting process more deliberative and careful than the Hawks have ever been disciplined enough to undertake. Where Paul L and Rob often revel in their reckless irreverence for traditional forms, Peter employs a more careful and thoughtful process. Both sides fought it out but surrendered when necessary and appropriate to the truth of the evolving song. The songwriters bounced around twenty or so ideas, completing about fifteen, including ""Singing In The Wind"" and ""White Cross,"" which appeared on the most recent Hawks record, Live And Never Learn. Peter and Gabi Onstage Many Hawks fans are familiar with the Good Intentions. Peter Davies and Gabrielle Monk have been voted Best Americana Band by the British Country Music Awards. They've released four albums produced by L.A.'s own Rick Shea with the cream of the crop of L.A. roots musicians. Hawks at Tintern Abbey in Wales I See Hawks In L.A. have released eight critically acclaimed CDs since their high desert conception 20 years ago, and were named to MOJO Magazine's 2018 Top Ten Americana Releases for ""Live And Never Learn."" They were just named ""Best Country Band"" by the L.A. Weekly. HAWKS WITH GOOD INTENTIONS is a collection of ten ballads, waltzes, and rocking train beats, sung by Peter, Rob, and Victoria, with duets and harmonies by both bands' singers, in unique combinations. Except for some slide guitar, this is all acoustic, with beautiful contributions from fiddler Gabe Witcher (Punch Bros) and Richie Lawrence (Yolos, Ray Bonneville). This is new British American folk, a cross-pollination with roots in the 70s, 60s, and much earlier. Rob, Peter, and Victoria visiting Paul McCartney's childhood home We're raising funds for recording costs, mix/mastering by four time Grammy winner and longtime friend Alfonso Rodenas, and CD manufacture and promo for UK/Europe.

At least that's what Jenna confesses to Rhett at the end of their first date. On top of that, she believes he's the Second Coming of Christ! Quite an unexpected responsibility for a college Freshman who is only three weeks into school. For now, the world is still intact, but Jenna, Rhett, and their roommates believe the end of time is starting right in their very own NYC dorm. Will their Savior rescue them? The play explores such current issues as identity, prejudices, faith, and responsibility through the lens of five progressive college students in 2018. Wrapped in the humor and light-hearted dialogue of Generation Z, The Second Coming depicts the current fears of the American youth and their journey toward understanding themselves and each other. Characters (in order of appearance) Rhett is a nice Jewish boy. Well, culturally Jewish�he's actually an atheist. Having recently moved from New English suburbia into the city, his excitement of living among skyscrapers has increased his confidence enough to ask out a girl for the first time in his life. Still, he is anxious about getting lost in a sea of strangers. It doesn't help that he's far away from mom and his older brother, who's studying on the other side of the continent. Nonetheless, he tries his best at socializing and not taking criticisms too personal. Jenna is mature and reasonable. At least she thinks she is. Actually, she believes she is... most of the time. But how do you explain having visions in the middle of the night? Anyway, she should stand for what she believes in. Even though it's not always fully clear to herself. But that's part of feminism; learning and growing. And now's the chance! The campus offers her many people of diverse backgrounds for the first time in her life, so she has to grab onto that opportunity. But she knew that already. Ivan is Christian and gay. No, the two are not conflicting with each other, not since his early teens. Since his parents accepted him, he did as well. But he never did anything with the gay part, really... The distance from home helps. It puts everything into perspective. But he has to find someone soon, just to... know what it's like, being gay, you know? He likes order and his relationship with God helps him with that. He's also very happy keeping all this stuff to himself... if only Rhett wasn't so difficult... Mariam is the daughter of immigrants. Never stepped foot on wherever her parents came from. She still knows some of the Arabic for the prayers and a couple of French phrases her dad kept rambling every now and then. Must've been a leftover from colonial times. But that's not much of her concern right now. She grew up here. She feels some pressure to show as a modern woman, but it is also kind of easy to her. She just is who she is. Oh, and she loves weed and thinking about things... Cheers! Tanya is a committed Resident Assistant of this beautiful dorm adjacent to the gorgeous park. When she moved in here, it reawakened some memories of her own Freshman year. Now she wants to make sure her ""Littles"" are having a similarly great experience... and that they follow the house rules. But don't get her wrong, she's also got her own dreams for the more distant future. She wants to keep those on the DL though, haha! About the Author Hi! My name is Mario del Cubo. I'm a Swiss-Spanish actor and writer. During my time at NYU Tisch, I started exploring the world of writing and found great joy in the development of new stories to tell. At 239 Arts, a theatre group a couple of friends and I founded in the summer of 2018, I began to create The Second Coming as a writing exercise. Eventually, the piece grew into a fully fleshed-out play. Now, I am excited to present it in front of an audience, and perhaps hear some feedback on my debut as a playwright. Performance A staged reading of the play is scheduled to be performed on the evenings of June 28-30, 2019 at a Manhattan theater (we're still scouting theaters). The show is applying to be acknowledged by Actors' Equity Association and will adhere to the regulations of a ""29-hour Reading."" Furthermore, I would like to encourage diversity at the theatre and hope to employ a team of young talent on, as well as behind the stage. However, this project wouldn't be possible without your help! Budget Our costs primarily consist of space rental, actors' stipends, and printing of programs. The following is a budgeting estimate based on possible locations for the performance. Space Rental (three 4-hour evenings) $1020 Actors' Stipends (travel and other expenses) $600 Printing Costs (programs and feedback sheet) $200 TOTAL $1820 This is truly a passion project; all individuals involved in this project will not (and cannot) receive any financial payment. However, the experience will not only help the development of the play, but also create a network of young talent and three enjoyable evenings at the theater for the audience. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me at mdelcubo@gmail.com or text me at (718) 801-2591. Thank you for your support! Best, Mario"

The story begins with Tom Chen, an affluent Chinese American who decides to celebrate the anniversary of his divorce with a dinner party. When his intended guests cancel, he impulsively invites the two Mexican day laborers, Javier and Diego, who are working in his yard, to join him instead. But as the three men are settling in to the evening, finding connections and differences in their respective American stories, two of Tom�s original guests show up after all, and the resulting clash of cultures and beliefs takes the evening to new heights--and depths--of desire, hedonism, and conflict.

The project is currently ready to go, with many designs prepared or conceptualized that will be ready for scheduled releases down the line. The cards are also priced to be affordable an accessible, as all greeting cards should be. These cards are created to bring smiles and joy to those who send and receive them and it would feel wrong to make them anything but. Before shipping, the cards will start at $5 a piece and this price will be maintained for the foreseeable future. It will be run through Etsy with two releases a month, at the beginning and halfway through the month. These releases will consist of sets of themed cards, always containing more than a single card. These themes will be holiday based, seasonal, event related (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) and will be available whenever possible through the Etsy website. They will be announced at least a week in advance to give everyone a chance to plan for them. Pictured below are simulated proofs of what the first set (Summer Fun! themed) released will look like. The cards when folded measure at 5 inches wide by 7 inches tall and come with their own envelopes. The current timetable dictates that after the Kickstarter, should the fund be raised, the cards will be ordered soon after an official proof is obtained and then the cards from the Summer Fun! first set will be posted on Etsy the first week of August. Rewards will also be sent out the first week of August alongside orders. Below are the two first release cards in the Summer Fun! set. The second Summer Fun! set will be announced around this time and will be placed on Etsy the middle of August. After that, there's a long list of cards planned. Some examples include... Oktober Fest Birthday cards for ages 1-10 Get Well Soon cards 3 December Holiday card sets Halloween And much more not listed! The current budget for the project is set at $350 for a beginning stretch goal, with the others priced to cover the costs of getting the cards printed and getting the mailers for them. All the money obtained through this Kickstarter will stay WITHIN the business. Not a penny that comes from you all will go into my pocket. I have more bonus cards planned, events, and graphic designers on the line to help me improve the look of the brand, and a web designer will be hired for a website should the budget permit. Most of the money goes to purchasing the greeting cards. There are a few stretch goals that are being offered as patrons give their funding. Listed below are the current stretch goals! $650 - Full Summer Fun! Collection The second Summer Fun! is released at the same time as the first during the beginning of August. This leaves room for more possible cards and releases that month. --------- $825 - The first set of Pampered Pets! If this goal is met the first two cards of a bonus collection based around pets! These are slated for a ate August or early September release and WILL NOT replace the currently planned cards. These are bonus cards! --------- $1,150 - Full Pampered Pets! Collection Release If this goal is met there will be four Pampered Pets! cards in the bonus collection instead oh just 2! These are slated for a ate August or early September release and WILL NOT replace the currently planned cards. These are bonus cards! --------- $1,400 - Bonus September Mystical Mayhem! Duo If this goal is met another bonus set of mystical creature cards will be released in mid September. This will likely be a duo of a dragon and unicorn although this is undecided at this point. Cailyn/Blue is the illustrator for these cards and has been working on designs and a calendar of future released for a long time. Blue/Cailyn is a 23 year old artist and illustrator from Cleveland, Ohio. She is currently a student of graphic design and animation who wants nothing more than to create and bring people happiness through her creations. She has been drawing since she could sit up and loves working in bright colors and fantastical settings and pushing her limits to improve as a person and as an artist. The plan for the business is thought up and ready to be rolled out. We just need our help!"

I have always loved fashion but struggled to follow my dreams. It was not until my family and I were on our last leg that things started to change. One day I took my family to Disney Land and my daughter wanted a princess dress. I knew I could not afford it so I promised her I would make her a special dress of her very own. When he got to work my wife challenged me to make something special, something more than a simple dress. What we created was magical a dress that could transform from an ordinary dress to a beautiful princess gown. As soon as other people saw the dress it was an instant hit. People started asking me to make them a dress and they wanted to follow me on social media. Designer Daddy was born! Since then I have been blessed to with great fans and customers that have allowed me to make some amazing things. Everything has been made custom by hand which is amazing but also means our work is very expensive. Our Goal is to make the magic of Designer Daddy more affordable to more people. We are scaling up to mass produce exciting designs. We also hope to introduce new designs and we have some amazing things planned for you! Designer Daddy is more than just me. I have always relied on the power and passion of everyone that supports me. I have been so inspired by the support that everyone has given us over the past few years and I know we can build something beautiful that will reach millions of people. We can bring a little more magic to this world. Thank you so much for your support. I hope you will join us on this Journey!"

For me these games are very nostalgic and bring back such pleasant memories of hanging with friends and playing some Good Ol' Card Games! I wish to create something that would bring these experiences to kids of this generation and maybe bring back some good memories for people like me. Here is a picture of a Orica Card based off of Yu-Gi-Oh It is only a collectors item it can not be used as a real card. This is not limited to proxy cards either. I will have pictures up of my own card game soon. For now this is an example that I made with a photo editing software called Gimp. Anyone who contributes 10 dollars will receive a custom made orica card of their liking own design and liking. Holographic card or non holo whichever you desire the most I will create it! For those who contribute 10 dollars can send me specific instructions on what they want their card to be like.

The Mammoth CNC Routers aim to bring large-scale milling capabilities to all skill levels at an affordable price. The Control Pendant breaks you free from being tethered to your laptop with USB cables by running the jobs for you. Our machines also bring about a sense of freedom from project-size constraints with their large cut areas. Welcome to the new standard for CNC Router Machines. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We have foregone a rigid base platform for our machines, as this is a leading contributor to the cost of many machines currently available on the market. Instead, we elected to harness the inner-maker inside all of us and build a base using standard 2x4 lumber that is readily available at your local hardware store. This allowed us to significantly reduce the overall cost of the system, and deliver a more affordable product to you. This also affords you, the user, the opportunity to build the platform as large or small as you want along the Y-Axis. We found this route to be most useful as well when it came time to break down the system to store in the corner of a shop, or when it is moved to a new location. How I store this Mammoth when not in use! For a cost of around $35, this hands down beats a rigid table that is many times more expensive and logistically challenging. 3'x8' Table used by a Mammoth CNC Plans, along with a building materials list, will be provided to backers for how to construct a few variations of the base platform. The variations offer solutions for those with both a larger and smaller area to use their Mammoth CNC in. With using lumber for the base of our machines, we are able to achieve a very strong, rigid frame that supports our machines in every aspect of their operation without sacrificing accuracy and repeat-ability. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Mammoth machines use Kevlar reinforced HTD5 belt to traverse along the Y-Axis of the base platform (as shown by video above). The Mammoth CNC comes in two formats to accommodate different space restrictions that you face, and what size of projects you may see yourself doing. The Hardware and Electronics... At the heart of every Mammoth machine is the TinyG motion controller. The team behind the TinyG has set a standard for motion control that reflects the high standards we have for our machines. We feel we have the absolute best motion controller running all of our machines. The Control Pendant lets you have complete freedom while setting up your machine, and running your cut jobs, all on it's vibrant 5"" touchscreen. Our Pendant accepts standard gCode, allowing you to use your preferred CAM software for all of your post processing. Running your job is accomplished by saving your files onto the Control Pendant's SD card. You can scroll through all of the jobs on the SD card, and select which one to run. Setting up the work space is all done through the Control Pendant in less than 5 minutes. All of the machine's power is run through an Emergency Stop switch, which will cut power in the event of an emergency. Power for the router is run through this switch, and a power receptacle is built into the machine. Two cooling fans are also used to ensure that the everything stays cool and runs at optimal performance levels. Router power receptacle built into the machine. One of our main focuses was to not have a handful of cables coming from the machine, and with only a single cable required to run, we have achieved our goal! Only one cord coming from a Mammoth CNC....the power cord! NOT INCLUDED: The cutting power for each machine is provided by a Makita RT0701 / RT0700 Router. This is the router that we have found to be best suited for our application, and provides the spindle speed and endurance that fits our needs. Some people may already have routers, so we have elected to not include this. However, if you need a router, one may be added to your order by adding $120 to your pledge. Software... To ensure that our machines are as easily integrated into your work environment as possible, the Control Pendant was designed to accept standard gCode, which almost all CAM software is capable of outputting. We use Autodesk Fusion 360, and have demo projects and tutorials currently under construction for this platform. Spoil boards... With the use of a 2x4 base platform, you are able to directly attach the spoil board to the base. Or, if you need that little bit of extra Z-axis cutting depth, you can always forego the spoil board and attach your cutting material directly to the frame itself. We have run using either method, and both work equally well. If you do run with a spoil board, 1/2 inch MDF is our recommended material. Mammoth Specs... Cut Volume: 34"" on X-Axis, 3"" on Z-Axis, Unlimited Y-Axis Max Speed: 2500mm/min Resolution: +/-0.1mm Mammoth XL Specs... Cut Volume: 54"" on X-Axis, 3"" on Z-Axis, Unlimited Y-Axis Max Speed: 2500mm/min Resolution: +/-0.1mm Why a Mammoth CNC... If you have ever had to measure out your usable cutting area to the nearest 1/16th inch just to ensure your project would fit, we feel you. Our main goal is to bring you a large footprint machine that you can make extravagant projects on, at a low price. Having your computer fall asleep during your project; accidentally unplugging the USB cable in the middle of a cut; not being able to design and process more projects are all issues most of us have run into using a CNC. Our Control Pendant is the solution to those very common problems. We wanted to address the need for a hand-held controller that runs your cut jobs and stays with the machine, so you no longer dedicate a computer for the job. It was for these reasons, and so many more, that made the Mammoth CNC line into what it is today. We can't wait to share this journey with you, and see what you create!

We are a husband and wife team using our passion for creativity to make life enriching products. My husband, John, and I had been in the automotive industry for a combined total of 32 years when we decided it was time to pursue a more rewarding and personally fulfilling lifestyle by following what we love to do and that is to create. We have enjoyed the entire spectrum of maker movement technologies from 3d printing and C.N.C. prototyping to Arduino based electronics, laser cutting and graphics designs for our plotters. John is currently expanding his artistic skills into 3d graphics, as seen in this project, as well as V.R. and A.R. design. The idea for the Holographic Gaming Tower came as an evolution of John's long time fascination with holography. His thought was to design a display as a complement to our computer system, something to trick it out by doubling the visual impact of our gaming tower. Having overcome the challenges of getting the right size tower for the selected holographic fan and dampening the noise when enclosed, John was well on his way to creating this display. Satisfied with the tower setup he began drawing 3d graphics and working on lighting to make this an attractive and unique display. We have decided to ask the community for help to take this product to the next level after multiple people have asked us where we got the display tower. Your support will be invaluable in helping us achieve the next goal of making these available to others.

In my work with a nonprofit affordable housing developer, I frequently meet people with misconceptions about affordable housing. Like many growing American cities, Nashville is struggling with a significant affordable housing crisis, at a scale that can be difficult to comprehend and even more difficult to imagine solving. It is critical to break down the stereotypes, numbers, and acronyms that can make housing development so inaccessible, and refocus on the human component of affordable housing. The initial prototype of the Game of Rent at Nashville's PARK(ing) Day 2017 The Game of Rent began as a simple conversation starter during Nashville's PARK(ing) Day in 2017, trying to engage passersby around housing affordability. Over the past two years, the Game has evolved into a highly effective teaching tool for building empathy and understanding around affordable housing. Whether talking to NIMBY* neighbors or advocating to decision-makers, the Game of Rent helps players put themselves in their neighbors' shoes. With a roll of the dice and drawing of cards, each person assumes a new identity - perhaps a single parent working as a middle school teacher with two kids, or a young professional with a few roommates, or a couple caring for an aging parent. I've played the prototype Game with bankers, students, community advocates, public officials, developers, teachers, and architects - in Nashville and around the country - and consistently hear feedback like, ""I'd never thought about that barrier to housing,"" or ""I didn't know that's what my employees struggle with,"" or ""wow, this is so real - like, this is my exact living situation."" The reality is that the rent is too damn high for almost half of American renters, but that statistic is still less meaningful than drawing a Housekeeper card, having four children, needing to account for an eviction record, and trying to find a two-bedroom apartment for under $600. The Game of Rent begins to simulate what members of our communities experience on a daily basis when looking for somewhere to live. Why Kickstarter? These challenges are different in cities across the United States, so it's really important that the Game reflects the local context - and that's where the Kickstarter comes in. My goal is to scale this project and make it available outside of Nashville. From Boston to Seattle to Austin to Charlotte, I want to make this tool - and the conversation about affordable housing - accessible to more communities, but I need your help. The Rewards The Game of Rent: Nashville Edition is fully designed and prototyped, ready for neighbors and housing advocates to get a full physical version and take it to their next neighborhood meeting! Each physical copy of the Game comes with a ""Not a NIMBY*"" sticker so you can show your support for affordable housing in your neighborhood. For other cities, Customized City Editions require the initial sourcing and verification of local data and design of customized map game boards. Every physical copy of the Game comes with a ""Not a NIMBY*"" sticker. Want to print and play your own Game of Rent? Print + Play Backers will receive a digital download link for a PDF of the game components with instructions for DIY printing, and details for additional components needed to complete the Game (like dice). No physical components are included with this reward. Don't have a use for the Game but still want to support the project? Show your support for affordable housing with a snazzy ""Not a NIMBY*"" sticker. Live in Nashville, or want to make a trip here (let's be real, who doesn't)!? Rewards levels that include invitations to exclusive in-person Game Nights with local housing advocates, or private Game Nights facilitated by the creator are also available. Exceeding Expectations What if this project is massively successful and funded several times over, you ask?! An online version of this tool is a stretch goal; however this skill set would require additional human resources for the design and coding. Pledges above and beyond the funding goal will be put towards that effort, as well as producing and implementing in-person and online training for facilitators and advocates in Nashville and other cities. Doesn't that sound awesome?! *NIMBY is a common abbreviation for ""Not In My Backyard,"" often referring to the resistance to affordable housing development in a given community."

I'm Barry Gregory. I'm the writer/colorist/publisher of John Aman Amazing Man. I grew up in a place that was literally twenty miles from a stoplight. On a clear day, we had two television channels. I was never the outdoorsy type like most of the kids I went to school with. Comics were my refuge. They were everything to me as a kid. Especially the great Marvel Comics of the mid-1970s. John Aman Amazing Man is my love letter to those comics. I wanted to write a comic that captured the spirit of those books that meant so much to me then --and still do more than forty years later. I enlisted the aid of the best superhero artist I've ever known in Steven Butler to bring it to life.

Super strong, super fast, able to fly and transform into a green mist that can flow through any surface, Aman was a one-of-kind. But X-Bureau operations chief Sylvia Manners could tell there was something more. Something Aman kept hidden. A secret... John Aman Amazing Man is written by Barry Gregory with artwork by Steven Butler (Web of Spider-man, Silver Sable) and features characters created by Bill Everett, Jack Kirby, Will Eisner, and other legendary comics creators! Here's what people are saying about John Aman Amazing Man... �John Aman is a superhero comic unafraid to cross genres in its glorious recapturing of old-school adventure. Prepare for a good time reading this comic!� Dirk Manning �It�s fun, it�s engaging, it�s very well-written in the way the best comics of the 1970s were well-written, like Steve Gerber or Steve Englehart or Paul Kupperberg at their very best, the art likewise. It�s not neo-Golden Age pulp silliness, and neither is it over-the-top, we�ve-seen-it all-before Watchmen-ish apocalyptica. It�s good, solid superhero adventure that still has subtext and meaning, appealing art and characters you care about.� Mark Shainblum ""An absolutely solid, completely professional superhero story that does a fine job of reviving Bill Everett's early superhero Amazing Man.

Industry utilizes titanium in jet engines and The hatch on the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle is titanium offering a weight savings of 35% and also providing increased ballistic protection over the original forged aluminum design. We wanted to make combat ready dice! A metallic element, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density and high strength. It is highly resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia and chlorine. Titanium has become dramatically more significant as a workpiece material in machine shops. Two industries are driving this. One is aerospace. The latest aircraft designs use dramatically more titanium than planes of the past. The other is the medical industry. Titanium is a common material used for implants and devices used within the body. Titanium�s high hardness and low thermal conductivity make it more challenging to machine than other metals that most machine shops are more accustomed to facing. Why is milling titanium worth the attention? There are at least two reasons. First, the material is used for high-end parts�not just components used in an aircraft�s frame and engine, but also medical parts, for example. Shops able to thrive in the United States increasingly will migrate toward higher-end work, meaning that a growing percentage of U.S. shops will encounter this material. That�s one reason. Another, broader reason for covering titanium milling relates to the procedures for machining effectively when the material is difficult to cut or the available speed is low. Not every shop has access to high spindle speeds and feed rates This project will help propel us into many other titanium projects in the future! WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE! -Adam M.

In the book the protagonist has the idea to �write� a portrait. With the purpose of bringing the person back home he puts them in an isolated condition for hours, days, alone with themselves in order to remove the mask of everyday life, which obscures the true essence in each of us. _____The idea struck me immediately as I had already worked on this concept in a different way in my previous performances.

ZinkyUFO puts you into the pilot's seat, making drone racing into a more personal and more immediate experience than it has ever been before. Reason we start ZinkyUFO Project We are working for FPV drone racing for 5 years, we love FPV because its cool and make you addicted to it, when you flying you can have out of body experience like superman, but flying FPV drones are not easy for beginners, the whole set equipment are include FPV drones, remote controller, FPV google or screens, cost about 1000-2000USD, and require lots time to practice and repair, and need the empty place to practice, the speed are unto 100KM/H, so sometime can be dangerous. that's why not many people are taste the fun of FPV flying. we decide to making the Ready To Fly FPV drone set under 200USD, must be safe, easy to control, tough, link with phone with real time, and easy to record and share the videos, we use the Racing drone 48-channel 5.8G FPV system on ZinkyUFO and link with phone without latency, plus Mixed Reality technology it bring this experience into another levels with flying colors. What is FPV? First Person View Drone racing puts you in control of a drone at a high speed: pilots get an out of body experience, and you will feels like a superhuman when you fly in FPV.

Situated at the crossroads between our world and the virtual world, mixed reality is an advanced tech concept that involves generating new environments based on the environment that you already exist it. This is not quite virtual reality, but as you will see once you are inside ZinkyUFO, it is not quite our world either. Rather, it is a thrilling and completely unique mix of the two. ZinkyUFO � We Have Liftoff play with friends ZinkyUFO is capable of auto-hovering, and it runs on a powerful, heavy-duty, 65000RPM motor. Operating on a 230Mah battery, it can remain in flight for a full six minutes, and the cockroach frame and protective structure ensure durability. There are two different speed levels, a headless mode, and a low-voltage alarm, and right out of the box, ZinkyUFO is ready to cruise. The shrouded propellers make it safe to fly anywhere, even around kids and pets, and you can fly it anywhere drones are permitted (under 250g, lighter than what the FAA classifies as a drone). Simple Controls & Tough Design You shouldn't even need to think about crashing, though, because ZinkyUFO's controls are simple, intuitive, and easy to pick up. Spend just 5 minutes with ZinkyUFO and you will be zipping around in it in no time � hovering, flipping, spinning, looping, and of course, landing! Toggle the lights off and on and get started (and get home) with a single key-press. It's just that simple. Crashes may happen, but ZinkyUFO won't break: the flexible, tough cockroach Frame that make up ZinkyUFO's outer shell mean that you can bring it to the ground again and again without nary a worry. ZinkyUFO � it may be tiny, but it's ultra-tough! ZinkyUFO-Game of Drones APP ZinkyUFO-Game of Drones is the mixed reality game APP that we have developed alongside ZinkyUFO, and it works with both iOS and Android devices. You can access a large world of characters, landscapes, cockpits, and content in Game of Drones, even using one of our special ZinkyUFO stickers to place a monster somewhere in the game (just by placing the sticker somewhere in the real world ). We spent nearly 29 month and made more than 30 different hardware solution in order to enable the iOS device to receive the 5.8GHz Analog video without delay at a reasonable cost: this was key issue because iOS requires their own MFI certify Chips to control the external information into the system. When we undertook development on the mixed reality tech and the ZinkyUFO-Game of Drones app in March 2017, our goal was to create the world's first MR flying camera. We have drawn inspiration from some of our favorite 80s and 90s video games, especially Pacman, and all of us on the FPVSTYLE team (hailing from locations on multiple continents!) are excited to launch ZinkyUFO worldwide. What We Need & What You Get After nearly thirteen months of development and more than thirty different hardware solutions, we are finally ready to launch ZinkyUFO to the consumer market. Our goal through this campaign is $10,000, which will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing ZinkyUFO on a large scale and moving beyond the fifty sets we have manufactured thus far. To say thanks to all our contributors, we are offering some exclusive, limited-time-only rewards, including discounts on ZinkyUFO. Risks & Challenges One of biggest difficulties we have faced is in figuring out how to avoid the MFI-certified chips that iOS requires. That, however, is done, and we are now moving into the production stage. We will soon offer an API for developers, building a stronger sense of community around ZinkyUFO. If any other challenges arise, we will be sure to keep all our contributors in the loop, remaining transparent throughout this process. Other Ways You Can Help Beyond making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for ZinkyUFO and the FPVSTYLE team by sharing a link to this campaign on any social media platforms you use. Get the word out about what we are doing and what we aim to offer with this innovative product! Know someone who is into mixed reality or virtual reality? Let them know what we are up to. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are all excellent avenues for spreading news of ZinkyUFO. We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for your time."

Hi there! Thank you so much for checking my project out! I've always had a love of doodling random things here and there ever since I was a child in elementary school. I used to read the comics section of the newspaper religiously every day my mom would get the paper! I always used to try my best to doodle or draw some of the characters I'd see like Garfield, Snoopy, Dagwood etc. I dell in love with comic strips in general. Fast forward to my awkward middle school years...I was a social outcast with a very small group of friends and we would get into some interesting situations. The idea of my comic strip, We Are The Bored, was spawned from my love of comic strips and doodling to my dream of becoming a cartoonist someday and my misadventures with my friends and awkward teen years. I know the idea of a comic strip based on one's personal life isn't exactly the most original idea out there, but it's something I've always wanted to do and keep alive. My goal is to get back into my long lost passion of drawing my strip and creating more adventures for my characters and to give them a fresh start! The funds gathered from you is completely going towards getting a tablet and drawing tool so that I can make my comic digital and bring it to you guys! I unfortunately cannot raise the funds on my own and I truly want to pursue my childhood dream and with your help I can see this become a reality! Every little bit helps and I'm thanking you in advance for any and all help you can give!"

The films that will be on the DVD will be seen in new 2K digital scans of archival materials preserved by the Library of Congress, and will be scanned by the Library of Congress' lab. I will create a brand new custom musical score for each film. One a Minute (1921) survives in an excellent 35mm print and Bell Boy 13 survives in a very good 16mm; these are the only prints of these films on the planet. The DVD box art will be created by professional graphic designer and silent era aficionado Marlene Weisman. The DVDs will be professionally authored and they will be made available for sale online as MOD (manufacture-on-demand) discs The finished DVD will be available via outlets like Amazon.com, TCM Shop, DeepDiscount and more, as well as international online retailers. The release will be publicized and reviewed. The DVD will be NTSC format, and will be region �0� (region-free). This is the same workflow as I have been doing successfully for all 21 of my DVD releases. This Kickstarter covers all costs for the DVD's production and release, as well as of the making of and shipping of backer DVDs. Kickstarter backers will get their copies of the DVD before it becomes available to the general public. Release date (expected): Based on my current performance schedule for summer 2019, the time it takes for scoring and authoring, and the wild-card factor that unexpected things will just come up, I expect to be able to have the DVD finished for you by the end of December 2019, and for a February 2020 release. Be ""somebody""� We've all heard of great silent films having been preserved at a film archive and thought, ""wouldn't it be great if somebody put that out on DVD?"". Here's a chance for you to be part of that ""somebody""! Make your pledge to ""The Douglas MacLean Double-Feature DVD Project""�and participate in a unique silent film enterprise. A bit about Douglas MacLean Douglas MacLean starred in 23 feature-length light comedies from 1919 to 1927, and his screen persona was that of a middle-class young man making his way in the world and going on wacky adventures. It was a type of film Douglas Fairbanks pioneered and made from 1915-1920 until he switch to swashbucklers when he made The Mark of Zorro. MacLean essentially picked up the genre where Douglas Fairbanks left off. He made two or three features a year and was one of the comedians you went to see while you were waiting for Buster or Harold to come out with a new picture. Nearly all of MacLean's features are either lost, overseas, or missing reels or are fragments, but these two are 100% complete and have been preserved by the Library of Congress. A bit about me I've been accompanying silent movies on piano and organ for 38 years; I play for silents at MoMA, at the Library of Congress, at the Silent Clowns Film Series (which I also produce) in NYC, and at festivals, historic theatres and at schools and universities throughout the US and internationally. I've scored dozens of silent films for DVD release for companies like KinoLorber, Milestone, ReelclassicDVD and Thanhouser and for air on TCM. Over the last 6 years, I've produced and distributed 21 DVDs of rare silent films � great silent films you've never heard of�but should � fan-funded via Kickstarter. The films have been sourced either from collectors or from the Library of Congress, whom I have a co-branding arrangement with.

Presenting the Venture Mechanical Keyboard Please send all questions to info@hexgears.org � this allows us to have conversations in a shared US support system. Inquiries on Kickstarter will be directed there as well. When the campaign closes, backers will be emailed a voucher code to redeem at Kono Store (our US partner). You must use your voucher on Kono to claim your reward. Black and Grey Venture Mechanical Keyboard Options Wireless keyboards let you choose your input experience. Want to game on the couch? Sure, and you can control compatible home theater devices while you�re there. Need to set up a presentation away from your desk? No problem � just unplug the keyboard and take it along. Wired devices (we launched a few this year) are useful for immobile work and stationary gaming, but you can�t beat wireless flexibility. USB C Port on the Venture Wireless Mechanical Keyboard Keyboard switches directly affect your keyboarding performance and comfort. Mechanical switches, which have discrete metal contacts and springs, are better than mushy rubber domes in a few vital ways. Mechanical durability is remarkable; Venture�s Kailh Choc switches are rated for 70 million presses. While you can rest assured that your switches will stand the test of time, there�s something more important to consider. Kailh Choc Switches Personalization is the key to your satisfaction as a typist or gamer, and mechanical keyboards deliver it. Three different switch options are available in the Venture � linear (red), tactile (brown), and tactile clicky (white, retooled). Each imparts a unique fingertip sensation, or form of tactile feedback, and doesn�t need to be bottomed out to activate. This results in slightly faster input, which is good for gaming. Regular rubber domes are squishy, unsatisfying, and almost always force you to press all the way down. View Venture�s features (below) to learn more and make a Choc switch selection. Most wireless keyboards are compromised by poor design choices. Some optimize for battery life at the expense of key feel and features. Others alter keys to save space, creating an unfamiliar layout, or use a custom dongle that is incompatible with a range of devices. In rare cases, those trade-offs are worthwhile. Most of the time they�re not. Nonstandard key sizes and other quirks can slow people down. Most companies fail to recognize that some of us want a familiar layout, which hurts the entire tech ecosystem. We created the 108-key Venture to avoid those pitfalls and innovate. Touching the Venture Wireless Mechanical Keyboard The Hexgears X-1 marked our debut in the US; it was also Hexgears� first Kickstarter. Amazing backers and helpful reviewers pointed out potential changes. Some of the ideas weren�t right for the X-1, which we envisioned as an ultra-portable keyboard. The concept worked well as it was � an X-1 even went to the South Pole on a research expedition. X-1 Mechanical Keyboard at the South Pole Most of those suggestions found a new home in the Venture. Mac keycaps were requested, and they'll be included with every Venture in the final production keyset. Larger batteries, sculpted keycaps, and new RGB features (like a light ring) were added. Wireless subsystem updates and other tweaks are also complete. Even the manual will be improved vs. the X-1. Read about Venture�s compelling features below. Included Keycap Set with Mac Keycaps - Venture Mechanical Keyboard Venture can remember 4 paired devices and switch between them in a couple of seconds � phones, laptops, and more are fair game. This is convenient if you multitask with different devices, as you won�t need multiple keyboards. Venture�s carefully tuned Bluetooth Low Energy chip saves power, offers wide compatibility, and responds quickly while gaming. It operates at the fastest possible polling rate for high performance low latency input. Multi-Device Bluetooth on the Venture Mechanical Keyboard Dual 2000 mAh rechargeable cells are included with the keyboard (for a total of 4000 mAh). That�s a lot of power � more than most smartphones. With RGB lighting disabled, the keyboard lasts 4 weeks with 2-3 hours of use per day. That runtime can even be extended. Venture�s batteries are user-replaceable via a compartment on the back of the keyboard. You can swap in standard AA cells or compatible rechargeable units. This increases endurance on the go and allows you to replace batteries if they degrade. Venture Mechanical Keyboard with Full RGB Lighting The Venture includes per-key RGB lighting, which is configured onboard. This ensures functionality with all keyboard-compatible Bluetooth LE devices. It�s also the first wireless keyboard with an RGB light ring. Numerous animations for the keys and light ring are built in. Battery life varies based on brightness, light settings, and use. We estimate up to 16 hours with the stock rainbow wave pattern. If the light ring is enabled with per-key lighting, that estimate changes to 7 hours � a full day of work or gaming. Three Choc switch options are available in the Venture. You must select a switch on Kono Store after the campaign closes (see Important Information above for details). Choosing a switch can be tough, so we're including some descriptions and raw data to help. Choc Brown: gentle, smooth tactile switch (quiet, general purpose) Choc Red: easy to press linear switch (quietest, great for gaming) Choc White: sharp sounding clicky switch with amazing tactility (loudest, retooled) Kaihua Choc Brown Mechanical Switch Force Curve Kaihua Choc Red Mechanical Switch Force Curve Kaihua Choc White Mechanical Switch Force Curve If that jargon doesn't make sense, or you need more details, read the following: Brown / tactile switches have a tangible �bump� when pressed, but no click. They�re a familiar option for typists and gamers � most keyboards are tactile. Red / linear switches don�t have a tactile bump or a click. That can be advantageous if you prefer uninhibited keypresses and extra smoothness during a press. White / clicky switches make sharp clicking noises. They also have a delightful tactile bump. Check with your coworkers, or family, before introducing a clicky keyboard. These were retooled for better performance in the X-1 campaign. They�re gloriously loud! The Venture's upper case is machine-finished aluminum, which is carefully textured and anodized for color. Its lower shell is durable injection molded plastic. This ensures solid Bluetooth signal penetration and reduces lower case wear. Machined Aluminum Case on the Venture Wireless Mechanical Keyboard We're including Mac keycaps for the bottom row � this is paired with a firmware Mac mode that swaps the modifier keys. Those were the most requested add-ons during the X-1 project. Other accessories may be finalized as we hit or add stretch goals. A carrying case will be included at $200,000 � but we're open to more ideas. If you have a cool suggestion contact our US support system via info@hexgears.org.

If you don�t know me, my name is Miah Ferran, and I�m a 17 year old high school student from a small indiana town. I play music a lot. Like a lot a lot. All the gigs, shows, choir concerts, camps, etc, that I�ve done have led up to me pursuing this huge dream of mine to release my own music for you all to hear. Of course, this process is pretty expensive, and, being from a very supportive, tight-knit community, I knew it would be a great idea to start a kickstarter campaign to help raise funds to pay for my EP, �Nothing... yet�. Recording this EP has been one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, and I cannot WAIT to release it! To start off this Kickstarter, I�ll be releasing my single, �Doubt,� which will also be on my EP! We�ve (my dad and I) put a lot of thought and care into this campaign, and sharing it with you guys is a great opportunity to show your support for local music! Sometimes it�s hard for small musicians to get that, but so far, I�m so extremely grateful for all my followers on facebook, my friends, family, and all the people who show up to my gigs! I really would be nothing without all of you!  So here�s to dreams and what not, I hope you love and support mine and share it with others! -Miah;) Recording process!

We link together our compositions with improvisations to create a unique and seamless performance at each of our shows. We recorded our first album, ""Parallel Fifths,"" in 2015 (listen here: https://nealandersonquintet.bandcamp.com/releases). Since then, we've been experimenting with and developing our performance concept with new compositions. We're ready to share these new compositions with the world - or even the galaxy - in the form of a new EP! I'm thrilled to have Molly Jones (saxophone), Nathan Flanders (keyboards), Jon Hammonds (bass), and Cory Tripathy (drums) bringing their creativity and virtuosity to the music on this album. Our new compositions are inspired by the idea that the music should dictate the form, instead of the form dictating the music. Each member of the band has the agency to dictate where a performance will go next. Intertwined with an exploration of melody and groove in odd meters and phrase lengths, I think you'll find our music bothy catchy and refreshingly unexpected. We recorded videos for two of our songs last year - one for the NPR tiny desk contest (watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6VRVhV_aiA), and one in a public access TV studio (watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8RMStXFtio). In order to make a high fidelity recording of our music and properly compensate everyone working on the album, we need your support! Between studio time, compensating the musicians, and producing the CDs, I expect the total cost of this project to total $3,500. We've scheduled studio time in May and will be mixing, mastering, and pressing this EP over the summer. With your help, we hope to share this music with you the end of the year!"

Currently, that involves grabbing LOTS of little pouches and packs. And if you're anything like us, that takes a lot of time. And somehow your phone is still out of reach, your sunglasses still get lost, and you're still asking a friend to dig for your keys. Enter MuttRuk With miles of trails under our feet and paws, we felt there had to be a better solution for getting outdoors with all that you and your dog need. Imagine grabbing just ONE pack with a place for both your gear as well as your dogs. Easily accessible pockets for treats, waste bags, even those stinky little used waste bags, water, sunglasses, keys, phone and more. Yea, we thought that sounded pretty great too.

I�m so glad you�re here to join me in the making of my 7th full length studio album, This Love. The writing and recording of This Love has led me to a deeper engagement with myself and with my singer/songwriter roots: Through this process has come a full, fresh immersion in the authentic feel of the music - both for me playing the songs, and for you, my listeners and friends. You�ll hear lyric driven melodies backed by raw acoustic guitar and sparse but focused studio instrumentation and sound. This album is an intimate meditation on life, destiny, loss, forgiveness, renewal. Above all, it�s a celebration of love. The release of This Love will also mark the 20 year anniversary of my 1999 debut album. And the sound of this new album is reminiscent of that first album in the acoustic nature of the songs. So, it truly is a reflection on all the years gone by: of living, of loving becoming a father and a husband traveling the world meeting the most amazing people everywhere that the music has taken me, making friends and playing with great musicians There have been a few sad goodbyes along the way but essentially it has been a journey of adventure and gratitude. At the heart of it, I�m still A Guy With a Guitar and I am still here singing these songs for you. I am so grateful to be able to share this inspiration with you. I am pleased to invite you all to be an integral part of the making of This Love.

However, our work doesn't stop there, if we raise: A GIF showing the growth of the gardens as donations grow! $50,000 Install 1,000 sq ft of additional habitat 120+ student kayak field trips (all expenses paid) Begin building the Floating Forest $100,000 Install 2,000 sq ft of additional habitat 240+ student kayak field trips (all expenses paid) Expand our floating gardens $150,000 Install 3,000 sq ft of additional habitat and 360+ student kayak field trips (all expenses paid) Expand our floating walkways $200,000 Install 5,000 sq ft of additional habitat 600+ student kayak field trips (all expenses paid) Finish the Floating Forest Make the Wild Mile the coolest floating park in the world! The Wild Mile North Reach (Render) Credit: SOM During this Phase, we will: Expand the artificial riverbanks and wetland habitat for native plant species and wildlife with our existing permits (Waste Management, Whole Foods Market and REI property line on Goose Island). Begin to bring students from across Chicago to the Wild Mile. Start creating the first Floating Forest in the Chicago River. Test and evaluate the efficacy of mussel habitats, floating tree platforms, benthic macroinvertebrate pallets, and supplemental aeration systems, among many other river restoration strategies to determine which conservation actions yield the greatest benefit to the river ecosystem and provide benefit to a wider range of wildlife. Our goal is to install all additional gardens and execute all of our student school trips for the 2020 river season which is approximately June 2020. Our team needs to plan out the designs, put orders in for plants and coordinate with schools in advance. If student led trips are sooner, we will communicate with all backers. Dr. Phil Willink Looking at Plant Growth The Wild Mile Is For The People The Wild Mile is designed to be accessible to anyone who wants to escape from the city into a natural sanctuary, surrounded by native plants, wildlife and the river. It is free to visit and enjoy, and provides ample opportunity for schools and community organizations to use the Wild Mile as a unique ecological resource in their own backyard. Additionally, educational programming will be layered onto the park with programs from young learners to graduate researchers to adult volunteers�many of these programs are already running. Urban Rivers Co-Founder Nick Wesley showing off some Wild Mile designs Ready to go The Wild Mile is fully designed and the next phase is fully permitted. The only obstacle remaining is raising the proper funds to fully implement the vision. Our Timeline So Far First pilot module - Our true genesis was in 2014, with the experiment designed by co-founder Josh Yellin. His experiment looked to determine if a small artificial wetland platform could attract more fish than other man made structures in a stretch of the river that was starved for natural habitat. This experiment demonstrated significant potential; fish were twice as abundant directly adjacent to the pilot platform than any other observed location in the canal and native species were witnessed spawning around the module, which proved that it was more than just an attractant but also supported growing wildlife populations. Building on this success, in 2017, we turned to Chicagoan's and the Kickstarter community to help us turn our pilot island into a full-fledged floating wetland. More space for native plants would allow us to properly research the ecological and environmental benefits of these structures in a meaningful way, and provide us with the tools to be able to provide the most value to wildlife. In 2017, funded almost entirely by the Kickstarter community in our first campaign, we raised over $25,000 which helped us install over 1,500 sq ft of floating gardens hosting over 55 native Illinois wetland and prairie plant species. We have been working hard to develop partnerships with community groups, schools, local businesses, and other companies and organizations that realize the value of supporting the larger vision of the Wild Mile. Partnered with the Chicago Department of Planning and Development on creating the Wild Mile Framework plan, which is a vision for how to bring the Wild Mile to life. Why the east side of Goose Island? The east side of Goose Island currently doesn't have any existing commercial barge or boat traffic which opens up the possibility for a recreational park to be installed for the community, by the community. Goose Island is a man made island, created in the 19th century by the excavation of the Goose Island canal by one of the first mayors of Chicago. For over a century, the canal dutifully played its assigned role as expanding industrial access to the Chicago River. In recent decades, the canal, now unused, has fallen into disrepair, and can no longer function as a navigable waterway (east side of Goose Island), and lacks the natural riverbanks to be able to support healthy wildlife populations. Centrally located in a rapidly de-industrializing area of the city, we realized an opportunity to create a wildlife haven where only rusty seawall existed before. Beautiful Shot of Gardens With City in Background Partnerships Over the last five years, we have developed strong, ongoing partnerships with prominent businesses and local organizations. From Patagonia who gave us our first grant, to Kayak Chicago who provides in-kind kayak donations for our volunteers, to Shedd Aquarium and Near North Unity Program who partner with us on educational programming--the Wild Mile is a place for everyone. Partner Organizations Press and Awards The Wild Mile has been featured in dozens of press articles, blog posts and TV segments. Most notably, the Chicago Tribune, Crain�s Chicago Business and WGN. Urban Rivers and the Wild Mile have also won prominent awards, including the 2017 ASLA Honor Award, �The Coolest Thing of 2018� from the Friends of Downtown, �The Silver Ribbon� in 2019 from Friends of the Chicago River. The plan is to continue to build the Wild Mile in phases toward the fulfillment of the community-developed framework plan and guided by the guiding principles. The high-level plan is can be seen here. Skidmore Owings & Merrill designer Rachel Momenee speaking to local kids about the Wild Mile!

My name is Cass and I independently run a small art and costume company called That One Pink Dog Studios. I've been in the business for years, but I've been creating art since I could first hold a pencil. Enamel Pins have been something I've enjoyed collecting myself, and I've always wanted to make an enamel pin design to share with all of you. Once upon a time, my significant other, Jack, had a video posted of him wearing a cowboy outfit that got too viral for its own good. We all know him as ""that one guy that says 'howdy' on Twitter,"" and I was proud enough of his accomplishments to doodle something silly for him. It turned out a ton of people really liked this ridiculous design, so I thought it'd be fun to make it more than just a silly doodle and bring it to life via enamel pin! These will be gold plated, iron, hard enamel pins that are approximately 1.5"" in size. The stickers will be approximately 3"" in size.

My name is DeAnna Lam and like many women I struggled with PMS for many years seeing my period as a bother and a nuisance. However, in the early 90's I began a personal journey to embracing my womanhood and after a great deal of education and training called my first ""Menstrual Empowerment Circle"" in 1994. The response was incredible and I knew I had found my purpose. Since then, I have been writing, teaching and speaking throughout the U.S. and abroad for the past 30 years with the goal of empower women by helping them to reclaim their menstruation as a source of inner guidance and renewal. Last year I was having discussions of my platform and the movement with my good friend who is in the jewelry industry. Initially the idea to collaborate was never thought of - we merely talked about one another's businesses in parallel. Eventually we thought of various ways that we might collaborate together so that I could share my message with the world and the idea for Goddess Compass was born. International Backers: Goddess Compass is for women around the globe! We are excited to bring a monthly subscription box to your doorstep wherever you are in the world. We will be using USPS (United States Postal Service) for International Shipments. We realize that shipping costs to International customers are high and appreciate your understanding that we do not make these prices ourselves and do our best to find the most reliable and economical option to offer our supporters."

It is about using the power of film to help not only save our democracy but make it better for everyone. We need to use every tool we have to motivate Americans and get them out to vote in 2020. RESISTERHOOD will do just that. UPDATE: Every reward over $35 will receive a digital copy of the documentary after its commercial release! In the two and a half years since the 2016 election, Americans have resisted and persisted. We've flooded the streets and packed the airports. We've spoken up at town halls and sat down in Congressional offices. We've stood up for human rights and for each other. We've raised our voices and we've voted. And through it all, RESISTERHOOD was there. This powerful documentary captures the stories of everyday Americans who became grassroots activists working tirelessly to defend our democracy and stop the erosion of our civil rights. RESISTERHOOD is about ordinary women, men and children doing extraordinary things. RESISTERHOOD showcases the wave that brought us the most ethnically, racially and gender diverse Congress in history in 2018. The film shares stories of hope that will re-energize the movement and inspire even more people to join the fight to secure a bright future for our country. RESISTERHOOD will stand as a testament to the strength of all of the people who fought to uphold the American promise of equality and justice for all. RESISTERHOOD aims to energize and inspire Americans to vote. The first phase of RESISTERHOOD did just that - through dozens of short films, we inspired hundreds of thousands of voters ahead of the Midterm Elections in 2018. The second phase is where you come in! We need your help with the production of a feature-length documentary to be released in early 2020. We have completed filming and are beginning the long process of editing over 500 hours of original footage. Your support will enable us to finish this critical project. We follow 6 Americans as they resist and persist through the first two years of the current presidency. A woman who marched from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 takes her power back to the streets, a congressman puts his freedom on the line, a grandmother runs for office, a great-granddaughter of a Suffragist becomes an activist, a professional athlete teaches radical love, and a new citizen stands up for peace. Making RESISTERHOOD is truly a team effort. We have a powerful, majority female-identifying group of professionals volunteering their time and talent to make this project a reality. From social media to artwork to original music to editing, the RESISTERHOOD team is experienced, enthusiastic, and dedicated. To date, we have self-funded this project and relied on financial contributions from people who share our passion for American democracy. Our team has donated their precious time and energy to work on bringing the many moving parts together necessary to create a full-length documentary. We hope you join us by supporting this campaign! Filmmaker Cheryl Jacobs Crim is an award-winning filmmaker who has been producing, directing and editing award-winning television specials and documentaries for more than 30 years. She has been honored with a gold medal at the International Film and Television Festival of New York, ""Best of Show"" at The Houston International Film Festival and two Silver Telly Awards. She has also received 12 Regional Emmy Awards for outstanding documentary and entertainment programs, including two awards for individual achievement in directing and editing. We've got the footage, now comes the hard part. We've filmed marches, arrests, election days, and quiet afternoons and amassed over 500 hours of original footage. We need your help to support our work as we edit and distribute the documentary. Here's what we need to do and where your donation will go: Editing: We need to hire a top-notch editor in order to make sure the documentary is ready before the 2020 elections. Media Rights: We need to pay to secure rights to news broadcasts and other footage to supplement what we already have. Music Rights: Similarly, we need to pay for the rights to all non-original music in the film. Sound Design: We need to hire a top-notch sound designer to edit levels and make sure the documentary sounds great. Distribution Fees: We will pay distribution and film festival submission fees so we can bring RESISTERHOOD to the widest possible audience. Every dollar we raise beyond our goal will go to very good use: production, operations, distribution and towards the creation of short films to be released throughout 2020. These short films will further the mission of RESISTERHOOD and inspire an even wider audience to make their voices heard and vote. Our rewards are just a small way we can say thank you for your support!! Your generous contribution will make our dream come true and help us bring RESISTERHOOD to the world. Here is a sample of some of the rewards that you will receive in exchange for your support: T-shirt: Soft, high-quality cotton t-shirts will be available in sizes XS-XL and in both feminine and unisex cuts. You'll get to choose the shirt you want after the campaign ends. Photo for demonstration purposes only. The actual t-shirt will be similar or higher quality. Photo for demonstration purposes only.

I'm Holly, an 18 time Kickstarter creator, 15 of which have been successfully funded and fulfilled. I've been a ""maker"" since before the word entered popular vernacular as an alternative to ""artist."" I'm going on 35 years of producing tangible visual expression. I do everything from designing enamel pins, to jewelry, drawing, painting, sculpture and more... What�s happening? What am I making? I am in the fields and mountains of Peru for the next two months and I will be documenting my journey through mixed media illustrations made from a combination of water color, colored pencil, and markers. I'd like to share this adventure of a lifetime learning about this amazing country and culture with you by offering my work as rewards! Since packing space is at premium while backpacking, this means that I have size limitations as well as supply limitations to work with, but limitations are often a gateway to creativity. All the supplies I�ll be using to produce these small works will be procured here in Peru. I�m offering two sizes of drawings/paintings. One is about 4x6 and the other is about 8x11. These sizes are approximate as I�ll have no cutting device and will be hand tearing the paper, as is customary with watercolor. They�re small pieces because I have one giant backpack (other than my daughter�s small backpack) to carry everything and I don�t want them to get crushed. I will be using Modigliani 200gsm paper. Small watercolor of wheat from the field on the farm we're currently at. I�m also offering two different shipping options. -Shipping from Peru (7 or 8.00 for the rest of the world) Ships on the 25th of July, August Delivery. -Shipping from the US (free for U.S. addresses 5 for the rest of the world) ships at the end of September/beginning of October, October Delivery. If you choose shipping from Peru, you�ll receive your piece earlier than if you choose free shipping from the US since I won�t be back in the US until the end of September. Why Peru? Other than the fact that Peru has nice people, lots of different climates; desert, rain forest, alpine, cloud forests, beaches, etc� therefore lots of visual variety, as many of my repeate (and MUCH LOVED) backers and Drip subscribers know, I am a nomad and split my time between the U.S. (Atlanta, Birmingham, and Los Angeles) and Montevideo, Uruguay. Every summer I bring my daughter (now 12) with me to Uruguay. This year the flights were so unbelievably expensive that I couldn�t afford it. BUT I have been wanting to go to Peru for most of my life and this seemed like the perfect opportunity for the adventure of a lifetime. Two months here is costing me HALF of what our flights alone would be to go back to Uruguay. SO, being the risk taker I am, I decided we�d do it! Where are we going? We were in Lima for about 2 weeks, just to get a feel for the place before we head out on the real adventure. Then we got on a double-decker bus and 14 hours to a little town called Ayacucho. They are known for their massive religious parades and festivals, gorgeous colonial architecture, and the start of a violent Maoist uprising that ravaged the country in the 70�s, finally ending in the 80�s. I�m hoping to be able to capture some of these things in my work. We are now an hour South of Ayacucho, an area called Cusibamba. We will be staying here for four weeks on a potato farm in the Ruta de las Papas located in a valley on the Eastern Occidental of the Andes Mountains. I will be hiking with my daughter and art supplies in tow most of the days we are here, and I�m hoping to make some beautiful small pieces, since there are about 4,000 different types of potatoes that grow here (I plan on painting as many kinds as I can), as well as other flora and possibly fauna. Large watercolor and pen drawing of the softly sloped mountain behind the farm. Once the four weeks at the farm is up, we�ll go back to Ayacucho, get on another giant bus and drive for eight more hours overnight to Abancay. When we arrive in Abancay, we�ll hop on another collectivo for two hours, then take a taxi for one more hour. We�ll then hike to a break half way up the mountain to get to the camp we�re staying at. The views are incredible from our tiny little two person grass roofed tent/hut. I can hardly wait to start trying to capture the beauty of the Andes, lush green in the valley with terraced farms and snow-capped peaks in the distance. Again, we�ll be hiking and making art most days here since wifi is spotty at best. A few types of the more than 4K varieties of potatoes that grow in Peru. Then what? After 14 days on the mountain, we�ll retrace our journey through the Andes, get back on the bus for a 16 hour trip back to Lima on the 24th. Once we arrive in Lima, I�ll be mailing off any rewards that are being shipped from here on the 25th of July. It will take about 15 days to get your reward once it�s mailed, this is an estimate for U.S. delivery. I hope you�ll frame your new piece, hang it where you can see it every day, enjoy it for years to come, and hopefully you�ll be inspired to take a risk in your daily life, change up your routine, or go on that trip you�ve always been dreaming of. Possible questions: What if I want more than one piece? I've put limits on the number of pieces just in case for some reason I have a ton of people who are interested. This doesn't happen too frequently, and I'm not exactly anticipating it with this project, but better safe than sorry. Once we get close to the end, I'd say within three or so days, I'll let everyone know if you can adjust your pledge to add on additional illustrations. If you choose to purchase more that one piece, most likely shipping won't increase, unless you add on like, 10. What will MY illustration look like? I'll be capturing a variety of subjects. Once the project is finished, I'll be sending out a survey where I'll give you the option to choose a category based on what I've painted. Most likely these will include: Flora, Fauna, Landscape, Cityscape, Food, or People. From that choice, I'll send a random but also the best I have to fulfill your rewards. What if there isn't a reward that I'd like to see? Then PLEASE let me know! I am more than happy to add the rewards you'd like to see and I love creating special things for the special people who show me so much support. As more questions arise, I'll respond directly to them them in the comments and possibly add them here if they're super important things that I haven't yet thought about."

Fairytales for Grown-Ups is a volume of ten fictional short stories to delight readers and bring you into new worlds, telling tales like: a mermaid taking her gap year on land, a string of mysterious deaths in a small town, a flood that sweeps through the suburbs stirring up memories, and more. All ten stories in Fairytales for Grown-Ups are written and ready to be printed. What You Are Getting Each of our rewards is designed with readers in mind�bookmarks to keep your place, a secret story postcard to bring delight to your mailbox, and the chance to participate in the process by having your name in the book, a shoutout on the podcast, or the power to choose a character name in our upcoming Vol. 3 or 4. Shipping is included in the price of each rewards tier, so the price you see is the price you pay. What You Are Supporting You are helping readers read more and writers write more. We know reading is important to you, and that�s why we value your support in this project. Your financial support will go towards the costs of producing and printing this book, as well as shipping it to you, our readers. Higher rewards tiers are designed to let you be an advocate for reading to your friends and family with additional copies of the book. See below for a breakdown of our costs. What�s Next? We just finished publishing the stories of Vol. 2: A World of Our Own on our website and via our podcast. In the fall of 2019, we'll be publishing Vol. 3 online with another set of ten short stories around a theme. We dream of bringing these volumes to print in the future as well...and many more books after them! About Penny Magic Press Penny Magic Press is run by husband-and-wife team Matt and Natalie Mills. Finding themselves full of short stories with nowhere to publish them, they decided to fill the need themselves by starting pennymagic.co, a short story anthology website and podcast. Right now, Penny Magic Press focuses on publishing volumes of ten short stories over ten weeks around a specific theme, such as Fairytales for Grown-Ups! In the future, we hope to expand by bringing on new writers and publishing standalone novels, serials, and more."

Example of noodle bowl on dark clay Example of kitchen utensil holder So far, all of my experience has been in a community studio setting.

That is not possible to do while working within the structure of a community studio- and understandably so! That said, we made the decision to make a home studio!

If I reach my campaign goal, I will send out surveys with all of your options! All noodle bowls will be handthrown on the wheel in either white or marbled clay. On white clay, choice of either a rice paper underglaze pattern or solid glazed bowl. On marbled clay, clay will be left partially exposed on the exterior of the bowl to show off the natural beauty of the clay, your choice of glaze color. All glazes a food safe. All pieces are microware, oven, and dishwasher safe. Please note that due to ceramic nature some objects can vary slightly from the pictures. Production Timeline July 20- September 15th, 2019.

Maybe your situation, maybe yourself. But learning to respond to your anger, not react from it, is the key to healthy usage. Think of healthy anger as a road you are walking. On the left side of the road there is the anger that we don�t allow ourselves to feel and express (which makes us sick and ruins our relationships) and on the other side we have anger that is over-expressed (which makes us sick and ruins our relationships). If you have veered off onto one side, you want to course correct back to the middle, not overcorrect to the other side. Aren't we all pissed off about something right now? We're not wrong to be. But how do we use that anger to change the world instead of letting it poison our own lives? About the book Unf*ck Your Anger: Using Science to Understand Frustration, Rage, and Forgiveness by Dr. Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN is a 5x7 inch, 128-page paperback book, illustrated by Trista Vercher. This is Dr. Faith's ninth book! In it, she uses her trademark combination of science and swearing to shine a light on this much-felt but little-discussed emotion. She tackles topics like: Anger's evolutionary function and why we need it even though we often get carried away with it The human brain's nine rage triggers and how to figure out your main ones The close relationships between anger and depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, trauma, and self-harm Tons of tools and exercises for managing your anger in healthier ways Steps for using your anger to create social change A new 5-stage model for practicing forgiveness A little about the origins of this book: It started out as a 32-page zine (if you don't know what that is, it's pronounced ""zeen"" and is like a stapled pamphlet but cooler) called This is Your Brain on Anger, which evolved into becoming one of the chapters in Unf*ck Your Brain. We've been steadily reworking and expanding those chapters into full-fledged books in their own right, in order of popularity�starting with anxiety and depression, and now it's anger's turn. (If that doesn't give you a snapshot of our national psyche, I don't know what does.) The book will be over 4 times as long as the zine/chapter and completely rewritten � it contains a few of the same big ideas but is it's own entirely new thing. A spread from the book, showing an illustration of a brain throwing unhealthy anger in the trash, with a framed ""healthy anger"" poster on the wall, and the text ""Much better!"" A spread from the book's chapter on using your anger for social action, showing an illustration of brains participating in a march, holding a sign that says ""enough is enough"" A spread from the chapter on forgiveness, showing two brains hugging it out. About the author The author poses with one of the classic focal points of anger discussed in her book. Dr. Faith Harper is a trauma-informed therapist with a PhD and a growing number of other degrees and certifications. She is the author of eight books including the bestselling Unf*ck Your Brain. She lives in San Antonio, Texas where she has a private practice, trains other clinicians, and writes prolifically. She proudly identifies as a woman of color and an uppity intersectional feminist.

In an attempt to escape comfort, reconnect to the natural world and set a new bar for ocean adventure, twin brothers Casey and Ryan Higginbotham made a decision that would reshape their lives. On March 18th, 2016 they embarked on a paddle from Alaska to Mexico with 18' paddle boards. The brothers carried nothing more than two dry bags of gear each and a camera. No support boats, no paddles, and nothing similar to gauge from. Nothing like this has ever been done. �As far as expeditions go, its got to be up there as one of the most difficult trips of any kind� - Jimmy Chin Raised with a never-quit mentality on stories of the men in their family that came before them, the expedition forces the arch rivals to set aside a past filled with intense clashes in an attempt to grow into a team. �It's like summiting Mount Everest for the first time� - Kelly Slater Motivated by a challenge of great proportion �By Hand� is a coming of age story exhibiting the mentorship found in the natural world, a testament to human potential, and an unspoken promise to never quit on your brother. �When there's a chance you may get eaten by a shark or bear, or fall off your board and get hypothermia, I think that says enough about what the commitment level of this trip meant� - Jamie Mitchell About the Filmmaker: Kellen Keene At 30 years old Kellen Keene has worked as a director and as a director of photography for some of the most compelling, dynamic, and authentic films that Patagonia and Yeti have put out into the world in the last 6 years. He understands and is drawn to human stories that are set in the wild and he has devoted himself wholeheartedly and very successfully to telling them. Keene lives on a farm and spends part of his year fishing salmon commercially in Alaska's Bristol Bay. He's stubborn about being true to a story and the folks he documents. So filmmaking for him has to be real in its endeavor to create honest and lasting stories. Kellen has been working on his forthcoming film BY HAND for over four years now. I have seen the rough cuts. I believe it's got the potential to become an instant classic in the outdoor world as well as transcend that genre in that it is based on a very human story that just happens to take place in the wild. -Chris Malloy Ryan and Casey Higginbotham: Born on the Central Coast of California and raised in Pismo Beach the youth�s of twins Casey and Ryan Higginbotham were unknowingly orienting them for an unprecedented expedition. (Paddling By Hand Down the coast of North America) Casey spent his young adult life working as a lifeguard at Oceano Dunes State Park while also training in various martial arts, competing in a multitude of physical competitions including Iron Man World Championships while also focusing his Political Science studies on Counter Terrorism. Ryan also lifeguards at Oceano Dunes State Park while spending his summers working Wild Sockeye Salmon Runs in Bristol Bay Alaska. His college studies were focused on landscape architecture, but he and Casey both knew their pursuits wouldn�t align with what�s considered a traditional path. Life after school has been focused on passion projects, Muy Thai kickboxing, ultra marathons, and various forms of self manufactured physical suffering. Funny enough, paddling wasn�t a big part of their background, far from it actually, but throwing out ideas and not shying away from them is a tendency that built up over their life. This journey is a testament to seeking out our mind�s wildest ideas and running towards them. The sacrifice made by both brothers and the adversities overcome, is overwhelming even to the most accomplished in the outdoor world. We want to make this film with people who appreciate independent film making. The 'By Hand' team has poured the last several years - and several dollars - into this project. We've followed the twins idea from conception to completion, documenting hundreds of hours of content. We've travelled high and low to interview over a dozen people to help tell the story and we've spent more hours than we care to admit in front of a computer writing and editing our hearts out. The current state of that work is a 1 hour rough cut film. In order to complete this project we need to get through a few more steps, which is why we are fundraising.... to carry it across the finish line! Our aim is to complete the film with our Kickstarter campaign. This will allow us to submit it to film festivals, and ultimately seek distribution after screening at film festivals. This opportunity for filmmakers is only possible thanks to backers like you, allowing independent films to still be produced. This process from start to finish of course is a long (and expensive) one, but we really want to do it right. It's important to us that each dollar spent on this film is intentional, purposeful, and absolutely necessary. The main portion of the work is done, however the money raised through your generous support of this Kickstarter Campaign will help us complete the below prioritized tasks to bring this film to it's completion: *Animation/Map Design: A professional animator will create a mapping sequence that will portray the route and length of the overall voyage. This map will be used throughout the film to remind the audience of their progression south. *Sound Design: A professional sound mixer will creatively score, edit levels, master the audio files, and create ambient sound design. *Music Sync Rights: Obtain the rights to music used in the finished film. This has larger financial weight as big fees are accrued to acquire master licensing as well as sync licensing. If we surpass our goal, any additional funds raised will go to the remaining prioritized projects: additional aerial footage to help showcase the reality of this voyage, marketing, and additional sync rights. Of course, the bigger the budget the more we can get done..not only in this production phase but post-production including screenings, distribution and more content. $64,000 is the bare minimum we need to get this through production and onto your screen! None of this can get done without your help. We are currently a very small team, and are incredibly grateful for your help! We realize this is a huge 'ask' to make a pledge and we want to make sure you get your money's worth for your patronage! We have a huge list of rewards including 'Limited Edition By Hand' merchandise, training and paddles with the brothers, private screening with your friends, and much more!! We hope you can find something that is right for you! YOUR backing truly supports our mission. All who donate immediately become a member of the ""By Hand' community, and we look forward to keeping you updated on the progress of the film. Thank you for your time, consideration, and support! photos by Colin Nearman"

To old friends and to newcomers, we've come a long way together since our first Kickstarter campaign, Game Tiles, in 2013. Since then, right here on Kickstarter, you�ve made an otherwise unimaginable variety of gaming terrain possible. Thank you! All gamers know that there's one theme that's a key part of any great adventure: danger. So we're proud to introduce our most deadly setting ever: Hellscape! Only the most intrepid (or the most foolhardy?) will venture into this lethal underworld... where peril permeates the entire plane, and manifests as fire that consumes the very ground beneath your feet. Here, the threat is relentless -- and your only imaginable victory is survival. Hellscape brings you detailed, modular terrain so real, so visceral and dramatic, you can feel the blazing magma on your tabletop. Enter if you dare... Hellscape has been painstakingly sculpted by hand-- every rippling lava pool, each jagged rock spire, every infernal rune -- by our team here at Dwarven Forge. Many of the pieces have a 4""x""4"" footprint, so modular building is fast and covers a lot of ground. Months of refinement have produced what we think is our finest painting to date, including specific areas with translucent paint. Everything is cast in Dwarvenite�, our proprietary casting material that combines great heft, tactile feel and amazing durability. For Hellscape, we've developed a translucent, yellow-tinted formulation for most of the lava pieces that allows light to penetrate in just the right places. About half our Hellscape pieces are completely new; the rest are updated translucent, lava-painted pieces adapted from Caverns Deep. You can see the entire catalogue of pieces here. We've done our very best to make Hellscape come alive! Hellscape pieces include standard anchor magnets wherever practical so they will stick to our terrain trays, making them easy to move and carry without disturbing your setups. One essential feature of all Dwarven Forge terrain is modularity. Hellscape is no exception. You can build the Encounters we�ve pictured -- or you can build something completely new, every time. You can also combine your Hellscape pieces with any of our other terrain for unlimited versatility. With this Kickstarter, we're also introducing some brand new technology: DF Light Panels: Our goal was to illuminate entire builds at once, without hotspots, embedded connections or batteries. Place your Hellscape terrain atop these thin, 8""x8"" Light Panels and illuminate your setup (in the right places) in an instant. You can use just one, or connect them together in a ""daisy chain"" (up to approximately 9 panels with a single transformer). One look and you'll understand why translucent Dwarvenite is so perfectly suited to this terrain. DF Light Panels are included in specific ""Illuminated"" Pledges, and are also available as Add-on Sets. Please note: Light panels will accept 110-240 input voltage, but will come standard with US style plugs. So you won't need to convert the voltage, but you need an adapter to plug into a non-US outlet. These are easy to find and inexpensive, but we will also try to offer them for the EU and Australia in the pledge manager for a nominal fee. Phantasmal Filters: Bold graphics are printed onto these 8""x8"" thin but sturdy filters. They look great (and appear opaque) on their own, and magical when placed atop DF Light Panels and light illuminates them from below (you can see the effect in the image below). Hellscape consists of: Three Main Encounters: the Crucible Chamber, the larger Torrent of Torment and the giant Soulcage Vault. Each Encounter can be built as shown, or the pieces can be rearranged and combined with other Dwarven Forge sets in endless combinations. The only limit is your imagination! Add-on sets: A wide assortment of Add-on sets to customize your choices and enhance your collection. New Add-on Sets will be introduced steadily throughout this campaign. Painted and unpainted sets: All sets are available either fully hand painted or unpainted*. Unpainted pieces will mostly be cast in yellow-tinted, translucent Dwarvenite (the color shown below might change a little for production). Please note: painting Hellscape requires more time and a finer hand than the typical wash and drybrush required for normal dungeon or cavern pieces. While this complexity makes our painted prices a little more than usual, we recommend painted sets for those of you ""on the fence"" between unpainted and painted selections. *Does not apply to Terrain Trays, Overlays, Phantasmal Filters, DF Light Panels and certain Pledge Levels. If you'd like to back our campaign, our pledge options are outlined below and actual pledge levels run down the right-hand side of this page. They include: A Build Your Own option for those of you who want to select Encounters and Add-on Sets completely � la carte. If you choose sets that contain unlocked free stretch goals, they will be included automatically. We've photographed some recommended Build Your Own pledges at various price levels (starting at $98 unpainted) here. With this pledge, you'll confirm all your specific set selections using our pledge manager after the campaign is complete. Hellraiser. This starter option includes an assortment of Scatter Terrain. These are standalone pieces that aren't just for Hellscape, but go perfectly with battle mats, other types of terrain or even just decorations for your gameroom. First, Second and Third Circles of Hell. These pledge levels feature our Main Encounters, with bonus packs and free stretch goals as specified. The ""Illuminated"" versions of these pledges include DF Light Panels. All Hell Breaks Loose. Our ultimate top level pledge includes double the sets included in the Third Circle of Hell, additional bonus packs -- and two Kickstarter-exclusive, very special resin capstone pieces. Here are some alternate builds of the pledge levels: ENCOUNTER 3 ALTERNATE BUILD First, check out the map below to get the lay of the land and a sense of scale. Detailed graphics showing our 3 Main Encounters, Crucible Chamber, Torrent of Torment and Soulcage Vault follow... Encounter 3, continued... As the funding level of this Kickstarter grows, our production run gets larger and more efficient. This enables us to add in both: Free stretch goal pieces that ""unlock"" (and are automatically added to your pledge) at specified funding milestones. Each free stretch goal fits into a specified set. If your pledge includes that set, you receive that stretch goal when it unlocks; if your pledge does not include that set, you do not receive that stretch goal. New add-on set options that we can afford to tool as our funding grows. Stretch goal milestones are eligible to unlock until the Kickstarter ends on July 1st, at 9PM US Eastern time. Our stretch goal map is shown below. In addition to the Encounters, Hellscape includes a wide variety of Add-on Sets. Some Add-ons are actually subsets of the larger two encounters, while others are specific types of pieces that you might want to add to your collection. Select Add-on Sets are shown below. Click here to see them all. 1) First, select a Main Pledge level. These are the pledges shown down the right-hand column of the page. 2) Once you select your Main Pledge, you can also include any other set(s) you see on this Kickstarter, as long as it has a price listed on our Google Sheet or our Pledge Calculator. These include anything from small add-on sets, to full Encounters -- or even another Main Pledge level. Take note of the total amount for everything you want. 3) To pledge, click on your Main Pledge selection. Then enter the total amount (including shipping/taxes) of your Main Pledge + any additional set(s) you want, and press ""continue,"" then ""pledge"". You can modify your pledge as many times as you want until the campaign ends at 9PM US Eastern Time on July 1st. You don't get charged until the Kickstarter ends. How do we know which sets you've chosen? I. When the campaign is over, Kickstarter will charge you for your pledge. Kickstarter takes their commission, and then they send the remaining funds to us. They give us: your e-mail (the one you use with KS); your main pledge level; and your pledge total. It's then up to us to collect all remaining information. We do that with our online Pledge Manager. II. About 4-6 weeks after the campaign closes, you will receive an e-mail invitation to this online Pledge Manager. It will be pre-loaded with your main pledge and your total pledge amount. You'll then enter your name and shipping details, and reconfirm your set choices from our online menu, which will be a much enhanced version of the pledge calculator. Once you're done, you can download a copy of your order, or even upgrade your selections (subject to availability). If you didn't include shipping/import fees with your pledge, the pledge manager will also collect them. III. This will be our 7th Pledge Manager, so please don't worry -- this part is easy and fun. Any questions at that time, we are absolutely available to help! While, with your help, we've run 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns, we remain a small business in a pretty narrow market. Kickstarter -- primarily through our amazing backers -- provides a platform that funds our tooling and allows us to produce relatively vast assortments of products that simply wouldn't be feasible if we were speculating which items -- and especially how many of each -- you wanted. In addition, Kickstarter helps us reach a lot of passionate gamers who have never heard of us. We remain deeply committed to this platform and most importantly, to the backers who support us. That's why we continue to offer our Kickstarter backers: Kickstarter-exclusive prices that will never be as low again. Guaranteed availability of backers' set selections (which, although we try, is nearly impossible to offer on our website). Our guarantee that Kickstarter backers always receive their product before any Hellscape items are sold to any other party. Shipping is not included in the pledge and set prices. You can see exactly how much your shipping will cost on our Hellscape Spreadsheet. (If you are including Add-on Sets, Kickstarter cannot provide you with shipping totals because it does not capture any shipping associated with add-on sets.) Please include the shipping in your total pledge. If you choose not to include the shipping, our post-campaign Pledge Manager will collect your shipping charges. Taxes Our Hellscape spreadsheet and pledge calculator will provide totals for import fees/taxes for shipments to the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. Duties, taxes and fees for shipments to other countries are not included and will be collected by the courier upon delivery. In addition, sales tax for shipments to NY and Connecticut will be collected in the pledge manager. We deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren�t able to make any exceptions to these extra charges. About half the pieces in Hellscape are already tooled, since they are translucent, repainted versions of Caverns Deep pieces. Therefore, we expect the tooling and production to be a bit faster than Caverns Deep, and we expect to commence initial shipments by April, 2020. Please spread the word and join in the Comments section. Your input helps us make the campaign the best it can be. Interested in reading more?

A dark comedy short film, �The Homeless Ghostwriter� will follow the journey of Ruth Berk, a now homeless former ghostwriter in her late sixties/early seventies, as she navigates her homeless life while managing her schizotypal personality disorder (STPD). When Ruth makes a peculiar new friend named Paloma, Ruth faces the challenges of her life-long struggle to connect with others and her strong desire to be ""normal"" or ""regular."" �The Homeless Ghostwriter� is unique because it is a unique odyssey story. The journey in this film is not a heroic struggle by a character we wish to be, but instead it is about the real struggles of a person who represents who we actually are. Doing this through an older women struggling with not only with relatable feelings of loneliness but with the additional struggle of mental health and homeless offers tells a story not often told. Additionally, addressing mental health struggles in the main character gives identity and respect to a part of our culture too often marginalized and ignored. The Film - The Budget Below is the budget estimates for the production of �The Homeless Ghostwriter,"" the total standing at around $9,000 for this short film, the total time not surpassing 19 minutes and a maximum of 9 shoot days. Overall Budget Outlook For a more detailed outlook of the budget - Click Here. A Film with a Cause ALL remaining funds not used to fund the film will be donated to St. Francis House, a homeless shelter located next door to Emerson College in downtown Boston.

I probably cried a thousand times but I�m alive, I�m loving what I�m feeling inside. This world is wonderful and that�s why I�m loving what I�m feeling inside.� -�Feeling Inside� by Paranoid Castle As the writer and director, Mackenzie �Mack� Blalock is excited to face the challenges of completing her BFA film �The Homeless Ghostwriter.� Mackenzie starts her senior year at Emerson College this fall, where she will finish her Visual Media Arts degree. In addition to writing and directing various different shorts, she has produced films in different genres, including period pieces (the 1890s), romantic comedy, and parody. Mackenzie�s other interests � like environmental sustainability, art history, and psychology � often inspire her creative work. These influences will flow into the creation of �The Homeless Ghostwriter,� where she strives to tell a story that is an empowering, but truthful take on homelessness and mental disabilities. Juliana Hartman �I don't mind that you lie sometimes, because I lie too, guess I'm just like you.� �edward 40hands� by Mom Jeans. Juliana Hartman (Jules is what the cool kids call her) is a senior Media Arts Production Major at Emerson College with a concentration in Producing, and a minor in Creative Writing. With her foot in both Television and Film, Juliana has a hand in The Emerson Channel as the Director of Programming and as an Executive Producer on the upcoming game show �Mind, Body, Blank�. She has also Produced and Directed several cerebral short films that engage with ideas of mental wellness and the question of life itself. As one of the Producers on �The Homeless Ghostwriter� Juliana is excited to delve into this fearless and heartfelt story that speaks truth to mental health realities today. Jared Quinn �Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen, Pour myself a cup of ambition, Yawn and stretch and try to come to life, Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin', Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin', With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5� -�9 to 5� by Dolly Parton Jared Quinn is an aspiring director, producer, and production designer, who is extremely excited about being a producer on Mack�s BFA film, �The Homeless Ghostwriter.� Starting his junior year at Emerson College in the fall, and working towards his degree in Visual Media Arts, Jared has worked on various sets as a producer and also been on the design and art side of things. His work primarily has been in film, but he has been a part of some studio television productions. Jared would like his future career to veer more towards film rather than TV. He is most excited to work on this project because he rarely sees scripts at Emerson that revolve around older woman, specifically one that deals with so many modern issues as mental illness and homelessness. Mario Mathiss �We may lose and we may win but we will never be here again� �Take it Easy� by Eagles Mario, is a recent business marketing graduate from Suffolk University. His role in the Homeless Ghostwriter as a producer is accounting and marketing of the film through social media platforms. The majority of projects and brand audits Mario has worked on in the past have been related to a business. Mario is very excited to work in this film production and bringing his business and marketing background to the film�s marketing strategy. Nico Carbini �If you don�t eat your meat, you can�t have any pudding!� Pink Floyd Producer/Production Coordinator Emerson College Senior Visual media arts, specifying in producing and grip and electric for the experience and also the future industry. He�s been involved since he�s transferred in 2018 as a second semester sophomore in both 48 hour film festivals, and as many video turned projects I could make. He is into editing, filming and acting but has recently started to enjoy producing. The project is enticing, he says because it deals with real life issues that seem to be completely desensitized and frowned upon with a misunderstanding of the real problem it lies under. It's a subtle light hearted narrative that will show attention in a cinematic way to mental illness. Bridget Connell �She wants to know why it is though she�s the door, she can�t be the room� �Stephanie Says� by The Velvet Underground Bridget Connell is a junior at Emerson College studying Visual Media Arts and the editor on The Homeless Ghostwriter. Bridget worked as an editor on a few BFA and BA projects in her time at Emerson, as well as editing all of her own projects and working in Emerson�s post production labs. Bridget is excited about the project because she wants to use editing to try and help accurately represent mental illness."

With a small pile of cards worth hundreds of dollars, I competed in tournaments with thousands of dollars in prize money. When I devoted my life to Christ I left that world and found a new passion in practical scripture memorization. I saw the practical value of hiding God�s word in my heart and it was not long before I brought this new passion alongside an old appreciation for cards. After years of development, The Scripture Card Project was born. I now desire to point others to the Bible, where they too can equip for the struggle. Because I have personally experienced the life changing power of Scripture memorization, I have set out to equip others with tools for hiding the Word of God in the heart. One such tool is the use of scripture cards such as those found in the Open The Armoury Starter Deck. The Starter Deck contains 70 Scripture Cards from the King James Version. Equip for the struggles of daily life with the weapons and armour of the Word of God. The verses selected explore a variety of themes from the Bible such as The Gospel, Faith, Strength, Spiritual Warfare, The Law Of God and Love. I encourage each of you to hide the word in your heart and be ready to fight the good fight as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."

This means that our fans have the power to continue or cancel the story. We crowdfund through Kickstarter because it allows us to bypass the traditional studio system, ensuring that the stories we want to tell are not constrained by what Hollywood is willing to fund. Every JourneyQuest film is produced under the Shared Cinematic License Agreement which allows you to remix, create, adapt, and distribute works set in the world of Fartherall. These are films funded by you for you. Note that anything marked with ""kickstarter exclusive"" is an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Take a moment to like and follow our social media and community accounts on the services you use (ZOE Facebook � JourneyQuest Facebook � Twitter � Instagram � Twitch � Discord � YouTube). Then encourage your friends and fellow JourneyQuest fans to do the same � these signups allow us to build enthusiasm for the campaign and communicate important updates. Additionally, this year we are adding Quests to our campaign. We know that our fans are our best promoters and we want to celebrate this! For all backers at any level, we will add exclusive digital rewards to your pledge for every quest completed. *Final Quest rewards are contingent upon Kickstarter campaign success. Throughout the campaign, our livestream studio will host JOURNEYQUEST�S MOST VICTORIOUS CHARACTER, Fartherall�s epic bracket competition. Your votes throughout the week determine which character will arise victorious from their encounter. Every Thursday at 6pm Pacific, we will announce the winners of the current week's matchups and immediately go into live polling for the next round's winners who will be announced at the end of the livestream. In the final week of the campaign, we will live stream a 5-hour campaign countdown and finale on Friday, July 12th. In addition to the game, we will host regular JourneyQuest watch parties complete with live commentary. Be sure to watch the ""Upcoming Events"" section above as well as our social media channels to make sure you don't miss a thing! SHIPPING IMPORTANT: WE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING AFTER THE CAMPAIGN IN BACKERKIT, NOT IN KICKSTARTER. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now. Anything that you pledge over the cost of a reward level will not count as credit in BackerKit and will go directly to the JourneyQuest 4 production. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your additional contributions making JourneyQuest 4 even more awesome. FULFILLMENT The JourneyQuest 4 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked, who maintain shipping depots in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Barring circumstances outside our control (like tariffs or trade wars) we will fulfill physical rewards from those depots. What will shipping cost in BackerKit? International Backers: expect to pay around $7.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward. United States Backers: expect to pay around $5.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward. All shipping estimates are subject to change but will reflect the best market rates we can find when fulfillment begins. JourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, and support staff. Together, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more. While our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of our cast and crew. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else! We are excited to shoot this season in British Columbia with talented Canadian director Joanna Gaskell, the co-creator of Standard Action. Showrunner and writer Matt Vancil has once again lent his talents to a hilarious season four script and will oversee production. Producer Tony Becerra returns to oversee production. He is joined by Mike Waverecan, a producer from M1 Films. M1 Films joins Zombie Orpheus for production of this season. Social media coordinator Lee House will add his considerable talents to spreading the word about this campaign far and wide. Of course, it wouldn't be JourneyQuest without our phenomenal cast. This season we're thrilled to bring back Christian Doyle (Perf), Alyssa Kay (Nara), Fran Kranz (Silver Tom), Kevin Pitman (Glorion), Brian Lewis (Carrow), Emille Shimkus (Wren), Jesse Lee Keeter (Rilk), Bob Sapp (Karn), Samara Lerman (Assassin), and many more! Zombie Orpheus Entertainment is pleased to team up with The Fantasy Network, a fan-supported, creator-distributed streaming service, to broadcast every JourneyQuest episode. In addition to works from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, The Fantasy Network distributes original programming from Arrowstorm Entertainment (Mythica), The Forge Studios (The Rangers), Recursor.tv (Nina Unlocked) as well as numerous independent producers (AFK, One Hit Die, Ren the Girl With the Mark). While many titles are available on The Fantasy Network for free, your pledge of $10 or more unlocks one month of Fantasy Network subscriber-exclusive access. We will be using BackerKit for pledge management after the campaign. A BackerKit survey will be sent to all backers several months after the Kickstarter campaign has completed. You will be able to update your address, add shipping fees and shop our pre-order store for any additional items from our back catalog that you would like to add to your shipment. Our shipping partners at Ship Naked will be handling warehousing and shipping for our campaign from their warehouse in the US. If we have a sufficient number of international backers, we will utilize their warehouses in Canada, Germany and Australia as well. World of Fartherall is available for your storytelling and art under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA). What does this mean? It's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall! Check out the web page for the full details, but the fast and dirty summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice. You, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited! Just remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law. Plus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome. ZOE and JourneyQuest are committed to cultivating healthy, inclusive communities where everyone is welcome. We extend that mission to improving representation both on screen and behind the camera. We're stronger when we work together to achieve common goals! We welcome fans old and new to the community that will come together during this Kickstarter campaign and remind everyone that hate speech is not tolerated in this space. Our moderators are trained to help if you experience harassment in any ZOE-managed social arena. If we happen to miss it when it happens, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know, so that we can take action to resolve the issue. We are always happy to assist! If you have a question that was not answered here, please send us a message through Kickstarter or via the contact form at zombieorpheus.com."

During the course of the game, a player takes 2 actions on their turn, selecting from 5 possible actions; place an explorer, place a tile, replenish tiles and remove explorers, discover a species, and record a species. Whenever recording a species, a player immediately takes one of 5 possible bonus actions that allow the player to set themselves up for future turns or alter the landscape. Players continue to take turns until The Rift Tile is revealed, making the portal to the new world unstable. Once The Rift begins, players add an additional phase to their turns, taking part in dismantling the landscape they have opened up for exploration. The game comes to a close as they race to complete their tasks and return home. When the game ends, players receive prestige points for their recorded species and bonuses are earned for specializing in specific sets of species. The Darwinaut with the most points will win the game and go down in history as a pioneer in this new age of discovery. Darwinauts is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up and plays in 30-45 minutes. Darwinauts comes in our bigger box size 9.5"" x 7.25"" x 2"". The same size as Forest of Fun! We think Darwinauts is GREAT but don't just take our word for it! Check out these previews and other helpful links! (Please note that all pictures use prototype components and don't always reflect the final product.) Check out the live play-through from Board Game Spotlight: ""Chaining tiles for resources, researching new species for VPs, and art from Vincent Dutrait makes this a fantastic, thinky filler with the depth of a larger game."" -Derek Funkhouser, Board Game Spotlight ""The amount of fun in Darwinauts is exceeded only by it's ease of learning and ability to make you want to play it again and again! The Mechanics feel familiar enough that you understand it in an instant yet deep enough to make you want to explore more options during each play."" -Dan Patriss, Geek All-Stars Richard Ham of Rahdo Runs Through takes a look right here: Click the logo below for a live play-through that Jason did with Infectious Play (Jonathan Gilmour and Ian Moss) : Tantrum House shares their thoughts: Edo take a look here: ""Darwinauts has a little bit of the feel of other tile-laying games like Carcassone, but the �remove explorers� action to acquire resources is new. I like how it keeps the game clock ticking, and pushes everyone inevitably toward the end. The one thing it doesn�t share with other tile-laying games is the way you can enjoy the map at the end of the game�because, by the end, there�s almost nothing left! If you like tile-laying games and far-out alien creatures, maybe you�ll want to become a Darwinaut yourself."" -Jonathan Liu, GeekDad Listen to Draft Mechanic gush about Vincent's art here! ""The growth and collapse of the map in each game of Darwinauts makes every decision feel vital. It�s a tight balance between efficiency and exploration enhanced by Dutrait�s excellent artwork!"" -Draft Mechanic ""It�s the perfect combination of tension and strategy."" - Angelica, Married Meeples A video update from designer Chris Bryan about the journey to Darwinauts: And more to come... We have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Darwinauts that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components and adding content to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery. That being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way. Here's a peek at the first few stretch goals! We'll announce more funding thresholds as we get closer to funding! If you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the First Edition Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! The rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the updated graphic design. UK and EU copies will be shipping from within the UK with VAT paid! (Currently seeking alternatives to UK shipping in case Brexit becomes an issue!) Note: International Backers outside of the UK and EU will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the ever-changing rates of the US Postal Service. We must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail. We understand that shipping to our international friends can be cost prohibitive and that others have found creative ways to mitigate some of this cost. We have managed to work with a partner in the UK to ship our UK and EU packages to backers to help alleviate VAT charges. As a small company that mostly handles our own fulfillment, we simply pass our shipping cost on to our backers. In addition, it is our goal to continue to develop our network of awesome international partners that we have worked with to localize Darwinauts for game markets around the world. Chris Bryan is a filmmaker and game designer. You might know him from the award winning web series he co-created, Board with Life.

When he isn't writing bios about himself he enjoys camping, gardening, climbing, playing drums, and spending time with his wife, 2 cats, and tiny dog in Denton, Texas. The visual world of Darwinauts was brought to life by legendary artist, Vincent Dutrait (Elysium, Lewis and Clark, New York: 1901, Rise of Augustus) who painstakingly crafted the various species by hand. Over the last 20 years, Vincent Dutrait has become one of the most beloved illustrators in the board game industry.

Initially a lazy/unfocused middle school kid, she gets into Murry Bergtraum High School through a second chance lottery system, and makes a promise to herself that this school is the place where she can start over. But things go south when she realizes the school has lost its formerly glory and she starts hanging out with the ""bad"" Chinatown kids. By the end of freshmen year, the principal announces that Bergtraum will get shut down by the NYC Department of Education if school conditions do not improve. While this is happening, she also learns that her family life is coming apart. With all this weight on her shoulders, will she fall into her old habits and drop out of school, or will she find the strength to overcome it all? photo taken by Kenneth Lei This film is inspired by my first solo show with the same title that premiered in NYC in August 2016. It is based on my life growing up in Chinatown, NYC, and it explores the complicated dynamics of finding one's place in high school with the delicate balance of living up to expectations at home in an immigrant family. casually cutting class and hiding from mom (photo taken by Karin Anna Cheung) I started writing the show in January 2014 because, at the time, there were limited opportunities for Asian American actors, and I didn't want to wait for an opportunity to come to me, I wanted to CREATE the opportunity. Ultimately, the show was performed 10x in NYC, and it sold out 7x at the TBG Studio Theatre + 1x at the Museum of Chinese in America and it traveled to Los Angeles in April 2017. LA Show at the JANM Tateuchi Democracy Forum (photo taken by Karin Anna Cheung) Last show ever in NYC TBG Studio Theatre - September 17, 2017 WHY NOW It has always been my dream to tell stories about the Asian American experience--especially in an independent film form. For the longest time, I was afraid of chasing that dream because it seemed IMPOSSIBLE; but with technology & costs of filmmaking going down + recent successes of Asian American films (CRAZY RICH ASIANS, SEARCHING, GOOK, ALWAYS BE MY MAYBE, PLUS ONE) & television (MASTER OF NONE, RAMY, PEN15) + a never-ending hunger for more Asian American content, NOW is the time to keep telling stories about OUR experiences. I have also never seen a coming of age film about a Chinese American girl from an immigrant family in NY, and I would DIE to see it come to life. If this campaign is successful, it will be the first coming of age NYC Chinatown comedy-drama independent film set in the early 2000s. I hope this project will inspire the next generation of NYC Asian American filmmakers to tell their stories. HOW WILL WE SPEND THE MONEY? The film is shot entirely in NYC and shooting in NYC is expensive. We are very ambitious, and want to shoot in actual locations and stay true to the story. We will shoot in a public high school, a Chinese banquet hall, three apartments + one big house, a college dormitory, and inside a convertible. All of the money raised on Kickstarter will also be used to hire our cast/crew, rent out camera/sound/lighting equipment, and feed everyone.

I am a freelance graphic designer specializing in logo and branding design. One of my 2019 resolutions was to commit to a long-term design project I would be passionate about. While browsing the internet, I stumbled across a deck of cards featuring beautiful illustrations by several talented designers, and I instantly decided this was exactly the kind of project I wanted to take on. But what should go on the cards? I�ve traveled to so many national parks with my family, and they seemed like the perfect theme for my cards. Each of the 52 cards features a scene from a different national park in the United States and 2 jokers with fun animal designs. After 6 months and hundreds of hours of hard work, they are finally available for backing on Kickstarter. https://articavisuals.com Follow me @articavisuals on Instagram to see these designs and my other design projects The Design The casino-quality cards are inspired by a vintage western aesthetic, and all the illustrations are drawn with individual lines, giving them a modern feel, connecting the past to the present. Each park is assigned a card value by its popularity, and the suit is determined by the geographic location. Southwestern parks are diamonds, with the Grand Canyon as the ace. Eastern parks are clubs with the ace as Eastern Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains, Southern parks are hearts, and Northwestern parks are led by Yellowstone as the ace of spades. Instead of traditional face cards, the aces, kings, queens, and jacks will have colored centers. The 6 of diamonds and the 3 of spades, featuring Kenai Fjord National Park. Lower value cards highlight less popular National Parks. The clean back design features the sun, the moon, leaves, trees, and mountains - all aspects of nature that can be found in the park. The tuck box design further complements the vintage aesthetic. It features a simplified version of the National Park arrowhead logo on the front and will have a key with all the parks listed on the back in fine print. When shipped, the white lines in the image below will be upgraded with embossed silver foil on a matte finish box. Adding some fun into the deck, the jokers, featuring a goofy antelope and bear, are great for replacing lost cards. What's included in a deck? A deck of National Park Playing Cards features 16 filled in park designs (face cards), 36 unique line art design national parks, and 2 animal themed jokers. Key of all the national parks featured in the deck. (Will be in fine print on the back box design) For Collectors! In addition to being able to play with these cards, they can also be a personal National Park Passport! Every time you got to a National Park, bring your cards along with you. You can stamp the park you went to with the official National Park Rubber Stamps (Usually found in the visitor center). Let's see how many parks you can stamp! Official National Park Rubber Stamps. Be sure to stamp your corresponding card every time you go to a national park! Reward Summary (w/ US shipping included) Standard or Dark Mode may be specified at the end of campaign.

The cards will be butter finish, which is a major finish for magic playing cards and cardistry playing cards. The tuck box will be a silk matte lamination with silver foil included.I cannot wait to ship them to my backers. This is a prototype. The final face cards will have filled in middle designs.

We aim to change that with vegan and health conscious menu items. Vegan Vrgr Shack, or simply VVS, will be the first 100% plant-based fast food restaurant of its kind in New York City. This fast food joint will provide NYC with fresh, delicious, and filling food options that will leave those who indulge craving for more. We will specialize in providing a delicious and healthier option to everyday American fast foods, burgers and tacos. We are raising money to obtain a store front so that we can provide consumers with readily available access to affordable, delicious, and healthy food options. The Blue Print Background: Hello, my name is Charles E. Edwards. I earned my undergraduate degree from Duke University in International Comparative Studies in 2016 and have embarked upon a Masters Degree in Community Development from Iowa State University. In my formative years, prior to college, I had the opportunity to live in Salamanca and Seville, Spain for one year. While there, I studied and traveled to eight countries including Portugal, Morocco, Netherlands, England, France, Germany, Poland, and Belgium experiencing the food and culture. Not only did I become fluent in Spanish and Portugueses, I developed a love for international cuisine and languages. My worldly travels, coupled with my creole and cajun heritage, have helped me develop a taste for creating and indulging in good food. While in college, I played football against some of the best players in the world, many of whom currently play on Sundays. As a student athlete, I was constantly eating fast food and quickly realizing the effects on my body. I transitioned and looked for cleaner eating options. While doing so, I faced the dilemma of affordability. It was something that I had a difficult time finding until I began preparing for the NFL draft. I connected with a few guys I knew from my hometown and created a vegan option that was both affordable and delicious. At the end of 2017, we had created a company that served some of the best tasting food in the city. After about a year, myself and my business partner elected to venture off on our own with aspirations of staying true to our vision of creating affordable and healthy fast food options. In doing so, we created Vegan Vrgr Shack, or simply VVS. Our last restaurant endeavor gave us great understanding and first hand experience in the restaurant industry as we have worked as advertisers, cashiers, cooks, held managerial roles, conducted inventory, secured business licenses, and last but not least, provided a product that was enjoyed by fast food connoisseurs. We will be taking our experiences and not only creating the best vegan food possible, but the best service and atmosphere. Wait this is VEGAN?! VVS's Vision: VVS is a 100% Black owned company. Being Black, I am all too familiar with the fact that many folks within my community are lacking access to necessary food resources that could allow them to be self-sufficient. These areas are known as food deserts. VVS is looking to enrich lives, through the way our community eats. In doing so, our goal is to create an environment and culture that not only promotes healthier eating habits, but a place where the community can come together and enjoy themselves. VVS is more than a fast food spot, but a symbol of much needed change in the community. VVS Taco Options"

This grilling set was designed to make your grilling experience both more versatile, and safer. Classic wire bristle brushes can be dangerous to use. The bristles can easily break off the scraper, and get left behind on the grill. Ingestion of wire bristles can cause perforated esophagus or intestines, which are serious medical conditions and surprisingly common given the popularity of the wire bristle brush. These bristles can cause damage while you eat, which isn�t a good mood setter for your summer cookout. Set a good mood for your summer cookout! The Grrrilla scraper takes away this possibility by providing the same capabilities as your traditional scraper, in a compact size with a strong solid body of stainless steel as opposed to bristles. How do you clean a grill brush? You don't. Gross. Until Now! Clean Grrrilla in the dishwasher! Simply remove the leather cord and put it in the dishwasher! ------------------------------------ FEATURES Our Grrrilla design is unique to us, as is its versatility. This scraper is compatible with almost any model of charcoal, propane (gas), and campground grills. The Grrrilla�s compact size creates a lower risk for any breaking or chipping, while still leaving realistic space for usage of the product allows for easy storage while still being easy to use. It also functions as a bottle opener! An extra way to ensure you have the tools you need for your cookout. For those who like to grill by lakes, or who simply like to take their portable grills out of the backyard once in a while, this tool provides a compact way to make sure every grill you use is clean. Compatible with most grills and able to fit in your pocket or picnic bag, this tool is designed for the adventurous griller as well as the everyday one. We are launching a unique set of stainless steel skewers as well! To make sure you really have everything you need, we have made companion skewers to our Grrrilla. Our laser cut stainless steel designs create durable products that can be used repeatedly without fear of quick wear or bending. The skewers are 9-inches long and made to fit any of your kebab needs. ------------------------------- SPECS While the durability and function found in these tools are important to us, so are the people who make them. All of our production work on this project is, as always, completely within the USA. Our skewers even celebrate this with an American flag laser cut into the top of each one. So throw them on the grill, and get a couple burgers going to celebrate with us! Open a bottle, enjoy yourself, and after it all you can ensure you have a safe and clean grill with your new Grrrilla tool. ------------------------- REWARDS Want even more scrapers or skewers?

So many campaign settings are High Fantasy. Powerful wizards, noble knights, and marauding dragons. Nothing wrong with any of it, but let's face it, you can't eat the same meal every night. I wanted something new. Something dark. Something different. Memento Mori started as individual stories and snippets of Dungeons and Dragons games. Eventually I used many of the concepts in my own home games, and after a time realized just how starved some people were for what I presented. I took inspiration from dark fantasy, gothic fantasy, and sword and sorcery. It just worked so well. For the last two years my home group and I have defined, built, and rebuilt the setting that would become Memento Mori. A dark gothic fantasy that takes place not in medieval times, but in the age of industry and exploration. Where firearms gave men courage, but the threat of monsters remains. Where lands long forsaken to old world horrors were finally being fought back against. A land where magic leads to damnation. A place where even fighting against this horror can lead one to their own destruction. Memento Mori takes risks that most campaign settings won't. Steamships, zeppelins, and trains. Weird science, witchcraft, and seduction to the darkness. A unique mix of that I'm sure you will enjoy. Magic is Evil: Throughout Vaetia, the world in which Memento Mori takes place, it is known that magic is a wicked force that drives mortals to damnation. All forms of magic in Memento Mori derive from terrible sources. Whether born or pacted as a Witch, or tempting damnation as a Magician, magic inevitably draws evil not just to the spellcaster, but infests them with it. In Memento Mori playing a spellcaster is a double edged sword. Your power comes with a terrible price. Does that mean all spellcasters themselves are evil? No. Does it mean that all spellcasters are at risk of corruption? Yes. Technology is On the Rise: Scientific progress is in full swing. Firearms are replacing the bow and arrow. Science is constantly finding new compounds and ways to heal the mind and body. Train tracks have been laid between major cities allowing more to travel the dangerous wilderness in safety. Large sailing ships now take explorers to new exotic lands filled with their own horrors and treasures. In Memento Mori you will have the opportunity to use technology to battle the forces of darkness. Grenades, rifles, and all sorts of other unique weapons, armor, and equipment will be available to characters. Some marvels even so amazing they rival magical items. Bonus: Marvels do not corrupt like magical items do. Classic Gothic Tones: Whether being hunted through the cold misty forests of Draskul, or coming across a crumbling estate filled with the ghosts of a dead and decadent family, A terrible romance between a young and kind nobleman and the spirit of a dead countess that visits him in his bedroom on every full moon. Memento Mori is ensconced with classic gothic tones. The world is under a great deal of change. Old monarchies are dying out as new ideas come into the world. These old nobles cling to their power through terrible secret acts with demonic beings, exacting the price from the common folk under them. A Need for Heroes: The world at large is in need of heroes. Forging new paths, destroying hidden evils, and recovering ancient lore. These are just some of the things that the world needs heroes for. With corrupt governments, ineffectual superstitions, and fear gripping the lives of so many, who does the average person put their faith in? Sometimes it is the disgraced soldier who fights for them. Sometimes it is the surly witch hunter slaying the undead horde. Sometimes it is the witch seeking to destroy her enemies. Whatever the case may be there is a place for it somewhere in the setting. New Races: Some unique races inhabit the world of Memento Mori. The eldritch Electus, humans who long ago ruled a vast empire and altered their biology. The Felisican, strange animal/human hybrids with a terrible history of enslavement and violence. The Kurz, a people grown from a nation overcome by Daemons who now live with a third eye and a terrible curse. Finally the Goblins, the only race not descended from humans on the continent. New and Altered Classes: Play the Alchemist, a unique chemist that can specialize in healing, poison, or even mind altering drugs. Play the Witch Hunter, a specialist warrior who hunts down to destroy the occult. Play a Witch, a practitioner of daemonic magic. In addition each of the new classes have at least three specializations. Other classes have new options as well. Some classes have been altered to help fit the setting. Rosenkratz Rosenkratz is the second oldest nation in Devara. First broken off of Alleagne, the nation of Rosenkratz fought a civil war to gain their independence. Once, Rosenkratz encompassed the lands of Creaca and Duvio. Creaca fought Rosenkratz to gain its independence, a concept that Rosenkratz allowed because of the crazed church that rules there. Duvio, in a surprising move, actually purchased its independence from the ruling lords of Rosenkratz. Rosenkratz is a wealthy plutocracy, with three major cities each ruled by one incredibly wealthy family. These three families, along with five others, make up the seven ruling families of Rosenkratz. The seven families are: Thobrand, Hollister, Glail, Ruxon, Mormont, Taycus, and Calmaker. These families have changed over the years. Only the Thobrand, the Mormont, and the Ruxon, are original families that have been around since the beginning of Rosenkratz. These three rule the major cities of the country, and the others are simply not to their wealth level. The Duvio's were once a family that was around since the beginning, but now control the kingdom that bears their name. Each of these families elect a 'Merchant King' from among the families to head as the executor of the kingdom. Effectively both a king and a pawn, the Merchant King election is a dangerous one that is most often a result of bribes, barters, and intimidation amongst the families in order to secure one of their own to the position. It comes with great power, but also severe limitations. The Merchant King can veto any decision made by the merchant families, but must rely on their collective military might to protect himself. Favor currying, dirty politics, assassinations, these are all part of the normal daily life in the Rosenkratz nobility. The current Merchant King is Darius Mormont, a middle aged man with a keen eye towards profit and power. Most think it was a mistake to elect Darius as he, unlike many others, is less of a pawn and more of a master. Darius has eyes towards Telmuria, and their decadent nobility. He has begun making arms deals with them, as well as mercenary purchases to help guard their borders. He has been making a hefty profit off of Telmuria, and has even been kind enough to extend a line of credit to them. The latter act has angered even his own family, but the keenest in the houses do not believe that Darius would be so foolish as to extend military credit without reason. They believe he may be helping them accrue a debt with him. A debt they will need to repay else face military action from Rosenkratz. Something they know the Telmurians will not want to do, as their eastern front is already in constant conflict with Draskul. Fighter Archetype - Triggerman You embrace the modern pistol as your go-to weapon. Unlike others you specialize in this weapon, and go so far as to learn new and impressive feats that few can match. Quickdraw At 3rd level you can always draw and stow pistols as a free flourish. In addition if you draw a pistol in your first round of a combat you gain advantage on your very first shot in that combat. Point Blank At 7th level whenever you target someone within ten feet you with a pistol you can choose to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to your damage roll. Quick Load At 10th level you can reload one pistol without any action once per round. Powerful Critical At 15th level you deal an additional 1d10 points of damage whenever you strike a critical hit with a pistol. Riddled with Ammo At 18th level you can deal a massive amount of damage to a single target whenever you strike an opponent with more than one pistol shot. If a target is hit with more than one shot in your turn they take an additional 1d6 points of damage for each successful shot at the end of your turn. For example if a single target was struck with four shots, three from your main hand and one from your off-hand, you deal an additional 3d6 points of damage. Monster - The Gog Gog Concept Sketch - SickJoe The terror of the Gog is known across Vaetia. The Gog are a pestilence that every country has seemingly had to deal with at least once. Once they find their way to civilized people the Gog spread like wildfire and can repopulate at an alarming rate. Entire towns have been shut off and burned to help stem the infection. Gog Pup's, as they a re sometimes referred to, are born with an overwhelming hunger. They seek out living or dead things to feast on and rarely hesitate to kill and feast on the living. Once satiated, or at least not starved, the Gog reproduces over one hundred caterpillar like spawn that grow underground Gog will find a dead host, and then sit upon their back, digging their head through the base of the dead hosts skull exchanging their mouth for the human mouth. They then wrap their legs around the spine where nerve endings attach to the dead hosts nervous system. In this way they gain complete control over the dead corpse. This new body allows the Gog to move faster, cling to various surfaces, and mutate the host to be far deadlier. This common Gog is known as a Gog Runner due to they high land speed. Though it is even worse when a Gog manages to bond with a living host... Greed Witch Concept Sketch - Blue Collar Boneyards Concept Today nearly all the writing is done for the campaign. I am looking to start a series of books detailing the world of Memento Mori. The Kickstarter will begin the series starting with these three: Memento Mori: Ars Technica - This book will detail the custom classes, archetypes, feats, backgrounds, equipment and other custom rules and features of Memento Mori. Memento Mori: Magic and Marvels - This book will detail the custom spells, magical items and marvels of the campaign. Memento Mori: Vaetia - This book will detail the various countries, cultures, wilderness, politics, and history of Vaetia. Vaetia is the continent where the campaign setting focuses upon. I will work on and release one at a time. Smaller books have smaller printing costs, and this works to lower the costs further. When the kickstarter finished I would start by getting everything ready to get one of the three books finished. Hire the artists and begin getting the layouts ready. This run through I've decided to cut some costs by shifting some of my expectations. The books will all be softcover, black and white interior with full color cover. Each book I expect to be approximately sixty pages. We will be using DriveThruRPG to fulfill all the lower tier pledges. If you select a tier where you are asking for only digital rewards and PDF copies, or select just purchasing one copy of the book, you will be be given a code as each book is finished to download (in the case of PDF's) from DriveThruRPG. For those purchasing special the books, or opting in for the physical rewards, such as the limited signed edition or initiative tracker, you will have to add a shipping cost to your pledge. You will get your books shipped in the mail from US. Electus Concept Art - Blue Collar Boneyards We will be running two stretch goal systems during the pledging. The first will be for additional funding, while second will be for Facebook Shares and Likes. Social Media Stretch Goals We are looking to spread the word far and wide. As such we are asking for everyone to 'Like' the Luna publishing page. Shares matter. we will be creating a post for others to share. Depending on the number of shares that post has we will increase the benefits: Facebook Page Link 50 Likes - We will include pre-made characters as a Digital Reward for those hoping to jump into the game. 100 Likes - We will include a short, one-page mini adventure for jumping into the game. 250 Likes - We will make all the art downloadable. 500 Likes -We will include character art and monster art in premade setups for printing and crafting pawns from. Twitter Retweets/Likes @luna_publishing 250 - We will work on making as many of our art assets Roll20 / Fantasy Grounds Astral Tabletop compatible as possible. 500 - The Quartz Rose, a strange and famous author, has agreed to write articles about various events going on all over the world. Twice a month for a year, and available for free. 1000 - We will craft a 'Memento Mori' cheat book. A printable booklet that will be able to be given to new players to help them understand and creature characters for this setting! Funding Stretch Goals $6,000 - Uncommon Races are now included. Say hello to the Dhampir, Promethean, and the Changeling. I will give some details of each continent into the books, instead of just Vaetia. $7,000 - We want more! Add at least 25 pages of more material to each of the three books. $8,000 - Books will be printed full color. $9,000 - Reference Deck - Cards that hold important information about various topics in Memento Mori. Great for quick GM reference, or for players to help remember. Print on Cardstock for best results as this is a digital reward. $10,000 - Books will be all Hard Cover. $12,000 - Double the art! $15,000 - Memento Mori - Horrors of Vaetia : This book will be a sort of Monster Manual for Vaetia. We have over a dozen monsters already made for Memento Mori, and several edited ones. We plan on building over sixty creatures to use in this book, and being that each creature will need at least one or two pictures made in color it will be the most expensive to make. Digital Reward backers will get the PDF as a bonus, and physical reward backers will receive the actual book. This book will be the last to be made, and will increase fulfillment time. Digital Rewards Customized Character Sheets Concept - Not Finalized Physical Rewards Though our Digital rewards are somewhat dependent on Facebook stretch goals reached, our Physical Rewards are already planned out. Gamemaster's Screen Concept - Not Finalized Poster Map Final Style will be determined by Backer Vote Memento Mori T-Shirt Concept - Not Finalized Player Character Journal Concept - Not Finalized Dungeon Master Adventure Tome Concept - Not Finalized Skull Inspiration Token Physical Add-ons At the end of the Kickstarter I will be allowing all of you to increase your pledges and payments in order to purchase various addons. Anyone purchasing our Physical addons will not be charged shipping as these addons will be with your physical rewards. Everyone else may have to pay for shipping. $15 Extra Book - If you want an extra copy of one of the books just let us know. The price is per book, not per set. Digital pledges can also use this to get a physical book, but would require the pledger to pay an extra $5 for shipping. $40 Extra Book Set - An extra set of all three books. $50 Limited Edition Book - Seperate Limited Edition copy for those pledging at the Alienist, Witchcraft and Weird Science, or the Explorer level. $15 Memento Mori T-Shirt $15 Poster Map $20 Art Poster - Pick one of our artwork pieces to make a poster out of it. I will have examples set once more art for the books. $30 - Custom Dungeon Masters Screen $10 Dungeon Masters Journal $10 Player Character Journal $8 Set of 4 Inspiration Tokens ""With an emphasis on the natural world and its sometimes macabre nature, I explore the small details and large questions of life through my work.

I want to remind the people that go to these churches the they are hurting their queer family, friends and neighbors and to encourage them to rethink the choice to attend and fund homophobic churches. So... I'm making some stickers and I need your help because I can't order one at a time. These are small black vinyl 5x5"" stickers with white text that demands people, �Stop Going To Homophobic Churches�. Perfect for placing anywhere you think they might be useful. I had three audiences in mind when I made these. Queer Folx - Centering marginalized people is the best way I know how to do a good job, and these stickers show our queer friends, family and selves that homophobia has no place in our cities, neighborhoods and especially not in our churches. People entering or leaving a non-affirming church - I believe that many people attending churches that are non-affirming are looking past the backward sexual ethic of many evangelical churches because they value the spiritual connection. Helping point out that the church they are attending is actively hurting queer people with their views and policies will hopefully make an impact on those people. Bystanders - I think it's also valuable for people not in those two groups to see these stickers and this particular slogan to remind them that there are queer christians and there are churches that both affirm and support their LGBTQ members. Homophobic on Purpose I choose to say ""homophobic churches"" in the text of the sticker specifically because it's more aggressive and attention grabbing and because the long form of, �Stop going to churches that refuse to accept various sexual and gender identities as valid, including stopping those with various gender identities and sexual preferences that are contested by bigoted readings of the Bible from volunteering and participating in the full life of the church"" but the stickers got long. This is not a lot of money. Why not just pay for them? Great question - I'm about five months into shifting my full-time job away from a career in programming and toward a less certain business as a film maker (meaning I'm very, very broke). This project has been waiting at least that long for me to have the money and time to order the stickers, so I'm reaching out for help to get this project launched! And what if you raise more than $200? As far as the amount of money raised, I need at least $200 to get a reasonable price for the stickers and will just order more if we exceed the funding goal. The goal is to have enough stickers to both fulfill the rewards as well as having enough left over to keep them for sale going forward. If we raise more than $500 I'll take the extra to help fund a billboard project with the same intent with the below artwork - I've found a local company that has a few digital billboards for rent at pretty reasonable prices (starting at $20) Stop Going To Homophobic Churches"

Rocket Age is a radium punk sci-fi game of exploring the Solar System, fighting Nazis, Stalinists, aliens, and the bizarre environments of nine planets (yes nine, it is 1938 and Pluto is still a full fledged planet). It is a game of ancient ruins on Mars, the steaming jungles of Venus, strange life in the clouds of Jupiter, RAY guns, chromed rocket ships, radium fuel, hot exhaust, and fins. So many fins on things you didn't know you could put fins on. The setting is a kitchen sink sandbox for you to set your games in. Want to be the brave explorer discovering lost civilizations and new wonders? We have that on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Jovian Moons, and more. Looking for a daring game of brinksmanship as you battle agents of foreign powers (even alien nations)? Choose whom you want to fight and who you want to fight for, such as the Americans, British, French, Nazis, Soviets, Martian princes, or the enigmatic Europans. The Rocket Age first launched in 2013 using the Vortex system (we call that version Rocket Age Classic) and won an ENnie in 2014. Since then we have added four sourcebooks, an adventure path, a fiction anthology, and 13 adventures. In that time Rocket Age has gone from its original publisher to being owned and published by its creator, Ken Spencer and his company Why Not Games. We love Rocket Age and we want to bring it to everyone. 5e allows us to invite more people into the Rocket Age. From the beginning we did not want to do a simple conversion, we knew that to make system and setting work best we would have to adapt both. Where possible we have kept the core of the 5e engine, you can use Rocket Age (5e) with your full collection of 5e products. We have species (instead of races), classes, armor class, hit points and dice, proficiencies, and so forth. Rocket Age (5e) has a plethora of alien creatures to interact with, but we want you to be able to pull any monster out of whatever 5e compatible monster guide you might want. Where something had to be changed in the setting, most notably the availability of psychic powers, we made small changes as needed. The result is a merging of system and setting, not just a welding of one to another. Now, eighteen months later nearly two years worth of work has come to fruition in the Rocket Age (5e) Corebook. The game is written, playtested, filled with art, and through the magic of our graphic designer, being turned in to a completed book. We would like you to join us on this final leg of the journey and bring the Rocket Age into a brand new era. For our long time fans, Rocket Age Classic is not going anywhere. From here on out all Rocket Age products will be offered in different versions, one for each system. These will not be dual stat blocks, but different books, one for Rocket Age Classic and one for Rocket Age (5e). We don�t like dual stat block books; they just add pages and make it harder to find what you are looking for. To our new fans, this is just the beginning. In the coming months we will adapt the entire catalog of Rocket Age, from Blood Red Mars to Imperial Jupiter. For both old and new fans, there is more of the Rocket Age to explore and we have plans for new adventures, new sourcebooks, new fiction, and more. You can follow us at: www.whynotgames.com, our FaceBook page, and the unofficial Rocket Age fan group on Facebook. Inside Rocket Age (5e) you will find: Foreword by Ed Greenwood 17 playable species from the bizarrely alien Europans to the ape-like Venusians, including all seven Martian castes. Two species, Ioites and Robomen, are highly varied in psychical form, allowing you to customize your character from an extensive list of species traits. 5 New classes suitable for play in Rocket age or any sci-fi or pulp style game. Each has a set of subclasses to allow you to flesh out or customize your character. Will you be an Agent working for a larger organization, an Explorer pushing the boundaries of the known Solar System, a Scientist uncovering the wonders of the material world, a shifty Scoundrel getting by any way they can, or a stalwart Soldier standing between danger and their loved ones? A system of psychic powers not tied to species or class, nor using a Vanican system. In Rocket Age (5e) anyone can be a psychic, but what will you give up for the weird powers of the mind? 19 new feats for those of you using that optional system. Will you be an Ace or travel with a Boon Companion? Do you Dance it Out or have Resourceful Pockets? All the equipment you will need for adventures in the Rocket Age! We've got RAY guns, disintegrators, Martian silthanka, Ganymedian heart bows, Europan pain batons, and much more. Armor, weapons, tools, clothing, technological gear, refurbished Ancient Martian tech, it is all in there! Complete and comprehensive vehicle rules for everything from a motorcycle blasting across the sands of Mars to mighty rocket ships blazing beams through the void of space. These rules interact directly with class archetypes and feats, making the entire system integrated from character creation to game play. The entire Solar System of Rocket Age covered in detail. Each entry offers not just the history, geography, and culture of a place, a sample NPC to interact with as well as three story hooks tied to that place and the beings from there. With a little imagination and some friends you can play Rocket Age straight out of the book. Ancient Artifacts from the lost civilizations of Mars and Venus. These items use esoteric sciences beyond that which even the brightest minds of 1938 can devise, so using them is a bit more than dusting them off and hitting the 'ON' switch. A big part of Rocket Age is the thrill of discovery, and our Artifact Analysis system makes all that possible with a single die roll, but be careful, there might be unintended consequences to powering up that weird bit of ancient tech. Disclaimer: Why Not Games is not responsible for anything that happens when you let lizard monkeys play with ancient artifacts. A bestiary of all the strange, exotic, and down right alien creatures found in the Solar System. Ride bahmoots across Mars, run from the thunder lizards of Venus, dodge kilometer long tentacles of the mighty Jovian gasbags, or get a tesselon as a pet. In addition to these nasty critters, there are plenty of NPCs to befriend of battle, including everyone's favorite punch receiver, Nazis! Written by Ken Spencer, the creator of Rocket Age, with a cover by ReOnna Smith, and interior art by Paul Bourne, Brain Eads, Jon Hodgson, David King, Scott Purdy, Peter Saga, and Miguel Santos. Rocket Age (5e) is fully compatible with Pulp Fantastic from Battlefield press. In fact, Ken Spencer wrote the system mechanics for both. You should check them out while you are here on Kickstarter.

This past year, my friends Eliot Nafziger and Juan Castaneda and I created a local art magazine highlighting various young creatives within Goshen, Indiana. Due to the support of the community we were able to successfully print and distribute over 225 copies containing artwork from over 25 artists. Vision: Our focus for this edition is humans� relationship with technology and its implications. As phones, computers, and the cloud are becoming tools we use on a daily basis, we would like to look at the various ways in which this has altered our shared existence. Our final product will reflect both positive and negative effects. We believe that combining talented artists with this theme will create a meaningful look at our relationship with technology through the lens of art. We are also expanding the pool of talent to include writers, educators, and advocates. This will strengthen the content and introduce new perspectives to our magazine. Logistics: This year, we are hoping to raise $300 through our Kickstarter and over $400 through corporate sponsorship. We will be expanding both the length of the magazine and the number of copies created, which will demand a large amount of initial capital. The specific quantity created will be determined by the amount of money raised. We guarantee at least 200 copies to be created if our $300 goal is met. Ideally, we would love to double this figure. Through your help, we can make this a reality. Additionally, we are planning a release event for the magazine in spring. More details on this event will be released in the future, but we plan to rent out a downtown space and feature our magazine, local art, as well as locally produced clothing from Eliot Nafziger�s brand: 6th Street Clothing. Your support will also go towards funding this event. Lastly, we will be filming and producing another short documentary covering the process behind the magazine, as well as artists� and individuals� perspectives on the ways in which technology affects our lives. Through a form submission process and a scheduling tool, we are streamlining our content collection to be completed by the end of August. Moving ahead, we will have months to work extensively on the editing, compiling, and finalization of our magazine, documentary, and launch event. If you have any interest in supporting young local creativity, please donate to our project! We believe Goshen is a city full of vibrant life and culture, and we want to display our perspective on technology while supporting talent."

This book, TOYPURINA: OUR LADY OF SORROWS, was a response to a personal project I have wanted to do for years. What started out as a month long story telling exercise to finally lay down some foundation stones for a longer graphic novel, has taken on a life of its own. I started this book last year on October 1 as drawing exercise to coincide with the popular #Inktober hashtag. I began each day with the set word prompt. I did not sketch out any ideas prior, but allowed this to be an exercise in trying to tell a linear story, connecting the pages each day in a larger story, but allowing it to develop organically to see where this story and these characters would take me. I did not know where this would end by day 31. Or what it would begin. And I did not realize that the work that would amount over the month of October would not only create a preview into the graphic novel I plan to do, but would impact as many people as it did. I actually finished a few days earlier, intentionally. I made it my personal goal to set the completion date of all story pages on October 25, to coincide with the anniversary of the revolt of 1785. I then decided to make 50 copies of books, collecting all 31 pages with a brief introduction and a few pages of sketches. I bound those in deer hide, which I cut, bound and branded into the cover the name TOYPURINA. I sold out. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The goal of this Kickstarter is to take those original 31 pages and reprint them in a larger size, (approx 8"" x 11"") along with an extended forward and sketch section, to be available for anyone who missed out on the original print run. I have since been contacted by numerous Tongva people, University level educators, etc. and would like to make this story accessible to them. I would love to add to this book some of the research notes, mission records, etc. I have discovered since last October. I would also like to include some of the script I will be working on this summer for the larger, extended graphic novel that will come after this book is launched. Any funds that go over the goal will be put directly towards the larger graphic novel. This book will reprint everything that was included in those small handmade books from October of 2018, and include extra materials to further flesh out my plans for this future project. The artwork is done. I already have a Native based print company to do the printing on the book, Lee Francis of Native Realities has offered to help with distribution of the book. For the rewards, I have asked Native based screen print shop SABAWEAR to do hand screen-printed shirts. All I need is your support!"

A story that goes past the concepts of a world run by machines. In most stories, the heroes will always win, but what happens when there isn't anyone to stand up and fight the unjust? What do people fight for in a world that just no longer cares? What happens when: Grim Indications. Abandon Hope. Burned it all, nothing left breathing. Past the concepts of a dystopian life of humanity, A look at what it means to be human. What it means to be a machine. What constitutes a personality, what does truly existing really mean? This horror is philosophical in nature, with blood and gore taking back seat to utter despair. The psychological thrills start from the very first page, for not so obvious reasons. This story is one giant Thrill, where nothing is on accident. The Recycled Society. A dark story, staring unblinking at the abyss of the dark side of humanity. A group fighting overwhelmingly powerful corporations and cruel merciless groups of mechanized assassins who would love nothing more to dye the world red. A unique story that I hope to shock you with, in as many ways as possible. That is Mechanized Fabrications. Against Overwhelming odds. Sample Part of a page. Thoughts. Who are the main characters? While there are central characters, there really isn't anyone I consider a main character. But for the sake of an introduction, I chose 3 characters. Grey Lives - An amnesiac whose memory comes back fragmented, he carries an optimistic outlook, an almost criminal perspective. He has one working eye, secrets aplenty that even he is unaware of, and a desire to help. Even more interesting, he has a last name, something most do not... Gray Lives Laura- A woman one part brilliant, 3 parts vengeance. She lost everything, and holds a grudge against most every Mechanized. Dead set on seeing everyone responsible for her past to be destroyed, her mentality may sometimes affect her personality. Kindhearted, but a no-nonsense person, she is usually paired up with Gray, rubbing abrasively against his personality. Despite this, she prefers Gray to most any human alive. Stewart- A mechanized penguin. The Kickstarter exclusive story explains more about him. A hacker's paradise, he more than not earns his place in the resistance. This little guy is a technological marvel, even by this story's futuristic standards. Laura and Stewart What is this story even about really?!? Well, disembodied voice, to be frankly categorized, this series is a Psychological Science Fiction Thriller. It follows an unnamed resistance group facing a world dominated by only a few. It does take place on this planet, make no mistake, but it is disfigured beyond recognition. Mankind Society has collapsed and no one knows why. In addition to being as disruptive against the mega corporations as possible, our heroes may just find out the horrible, twisted truth behind the current world. It's a journey through a rough landscape, bringing an ever increasing (and decreasing...) cast of unique characters towards a singular goal. There is a small element of mystery as well, as the characters, as well as the reader, are given pieces to a complex puzzle that explains everything. I am not a believer of anything being completely good, or evil, and incorporate that into my storytelling. I believe the readers will enjoy this ambiguity, as I do my best to give everyone depth. While one could side with the resistance, one can also understand the various other sides as well. While gloom and doom make up the story's main drive, this is not a tale without it's moments of playing with your emotions. I hope to craft something that leaves a lasting impact on everyone who reads it! A shut off Utopia, looking in from the outside. Okay, so that's all great an' all, but what do i get from this? Well, okay, pushy voice, I shall show you, in pictures! As you can see through this, my main focus is to get the story to everyone, and be allowed the funds to continue the story for quite awhile. This is the mock-up of what the cover of issue one looks like: Cover for Issue 1 Okaaaaay... Neat. So, who is behind this machination? As of right now, I am a one person crew. Names Sebastian.

This book is my contribution to the world and to the media as a whole. The world may change, but the universe remains the same. Remembrance. I like to think, and I've been doing art my entire life.

I prefer medium to long-term projects because, in a time when everything is quickly consumed, I think it�s important to take some time and elaborate subjects that could easily go unnoticed, such as social and environmental issues. Two of my long-term projects, �MiRelLa� and �Omo Change� won the World Press Photo Award respectively in 2013 and 2018, and now, after six years of work, the will is to make Omo Change a book. ITA - Sono Fausto Podavini, fotogiornalista freelance. Prediligo lavori a medio lungo termine perch�, in un�epoca dove tutto si consuma velocemente, ritengo importante soffermarsi ed approfondire tematiche che altrimenti potrebbero passare inosservate, come quelle di carattere sociale ed ambientale. Due dei miei long term project, MiRelLa ed Omo Change sono stati premiati con il World Press Photo rispettivamente nel 2013 e nel 2018, ed ora, dopo sei anni di lavoro, la volont� � quella di fare diventare Omo Change un libro. EN - In 2011, I visited Northern Ethiopia for the first time to work on a project about the Tewahedo religion. From there I moved to the Tigray region and there I came to learn about what would become the biggest investment in Ethiopia, the construction of the highest dam in all of Africa, in the southern part of the country. I don�t know why exactly, surely for an interest in environmental issues, but a bell rang inside me and I decided to start researching and found out, among other things, that this dam would be built on the Omo River, the biggest and most important river in Ethiopia that, crossing the country towards south, creates its the Omo Valley before entering Kenya and becoming the Turkana Lake. In the waters of a river, the fate of two countries. ITA - Nel 2011 entrai per la prima volta in Etiopia del Nord per un lavoro sulla religione Tawaedho ed � l�, nella regione del Tigrai, che venni a conoscenza di quello che sarebbe stato il pi� grande investimento fatto in Etiopia, la costruzione dell�attuale pi� alta diga di tutta l�Africa, nel Sud del paese. Non so bene perch�, di sicuro per un interesse verso temi di carattere ambientale, ma un campanello risuon� dentro di me e comincia cos� a documentarmi per scoprire, tra le altre cose, che la diga sarebbe stata costruita sul fiume Omo, ovvero il corso d�acqua pi� grande ed importante dell�Etiopia. Scorrendo verso sud, il fiume Omo attraversa l�omonima valle per terminare il suo percorso in Kenya e diventare lago Turkana. Nelle acque di un fiume, il destino di due paesi. Photo (B) EN - The Omo Valley, the land that gave birth to humanity, is one of the most incredible areas in the African continent. This place is wild, difficult, charming and unique, and unique are the people living there. Divided in various ethnicities, each with their own rights, colors and customs, but all united by the same dependence; the river. Their tribal rites and essential homes reveal a deep balance with nature. Even with lots of difficulties, living aligned with nature is possible and the Omo Valley and its inhabitants were the perfect example. ITA - La Valle dell�Omo, la terra che diede i natali all'umanit�, � una delle zone pi� incredibili dell�intera Africa. E� un posto selvaggio, difficile, affascinante, unico, come uniche sono le persone che lo vivono. Divise in varie etnie, tutte con le loro prerogative, i loro colori e le loro usanze, sono unite da una stessa dipendenza, quella dal fiume. Riti tribali, abitazioni essenziali, sguardi profondi equilibrio perfetto con la natura. Anche se con mille difficolt� � possibile vivere in sintonia con la natura e la Valle dell�Omo e la sua gente ne era un perfetto esempio. Photo (C) EN - This is how I started my project �Omo Change�; the crazy idea of documenting the before, during and after of what would become the social and environmental changes linked to the building of the Gibe III, the biggest Ethiopian development project. For six years I lived the Omo Valley and met Karo, Hamar, Daasanach and Bodi. I held hands, I received smiles, I felt their warmth. I breathed their lifestyle, their tribal rituals, I ate and slept with them in their villages, trying to understand them as much as possible. While my project continued so did the works for the constructions of the dam. I was hoping nothing would change for these tribes, but I had to think again every time I went there. I watched helplessly, but always with my camera to document the consequences of what is way too easily defined as 'development.' Although the Ethiopian constitution provides for consultation with this tribes about everything regarding a development plan, the construction of the Gibe III dam imposed on their life, changing it and leaving these people as unaware viewers of their own changes, modifying forever their culture and habits, but relegating them to the margins of a society that is no longer their own, but a new forms of colonization: economic investments. ITA - Ho iniziato cos� il mio progetto Omo Change. Un�idea folle; voler documentare il prima, il durante e il dopo di quello che sarebbero stati gli eventuali cambiamenti sociali ed ambientali collegati alla costruzione della Gibe III, il pi� grande progetto Etiope. Per 6 anni ho vissuto la Valle dell�Omo, ho conosciuto Karo, Hamar, Daasanach, Bodi. Ho stretto mani, ho ricevuto sorrisi, ho sentito il loro calore. Ho respirato le loro usanze e i loro riti tribali, ho mangiato con loro e dormito nei loro villaggi, cercando per quanto possibile di comprenderli. E mentre negli anni il mio lavoro procedeva cos� come avanzavano i lavori di costruzione della diga, ho sperato che nulla sarebbe cambiato per questi popoli, dovendomi per� ricredere viaggio dopo viaggio. Ho assistito inerme se non con la mia macchina fotografica che le documentasse, a quelle conseguenze che troppo semplicemente si definiscono sviluppo. Bench� la costituzione etiope preveda la consultazione di questi popoli per ci� che riguarda eventuali piani di sviluppo, l�opera della costruzione della diga Gibe III si � abbattuta sulle loro vite, trasformandole e lasciandoli spettatori inconsapevoli del loro stesso cambiamento, modificando per sempre le loro culture e le loro abitudini, relegandoli ai margini di una societ� non pi� loro ma basata su nuove forme di colonizzazione: gli investimenti economici. EN - Not happy to only document the changes of the Omo Valley (Omo Change), to testify about one on the biggest environmental impacts in the Horn of Africa caused by mankind, I felt the need to travel to the Turkana Lake. Living in this area is very hard, and the lake, the main livelihood for the Turkana ethnic group, is also shrinking, due to the reduced flow of water from the Omo River. The lake shrank so much that even UNESCO noticed and decided to identify it as a �World Heritage in Danger�. This has been decided by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations during the recent congress in Manama, Bahrein (June 24th � July 4th 2018). ITA - Non contento di assistere al cambiamento della valle dell�Omo, (l�Omo Change), per poter essere testimone di uno dei pi� grandi impatti ambientali del Corno d�Africa causati dall�uomo, ho sentito la necessit� di spingermi fino al lago Turkana. In una delle zone pi� difficili da vivere, il lago Turkana, principale sostentamento per l�etnia dei Turkana si sta ritirato anche a causa del poco afflusso di acqua da parte dell�Omo. Si � ritirato talmente tanto che se ne � accorta anche l�UNESCO, definendo il Turkana ""Patrimonio mondiale in pericolo"". Lo ha deciso il World Heritage Commitee delle Nazioni Unite durante il recente congresso a Manama, in Bahrein (24 Giugno, 4 Luglio 2018). Photo (E) EN - �Omo Change� is all of this: a document, a scream, a meditation, an awareness, an act of love for a land that is disappearing and that is showing us, without filters, of what humankind in the guise of multinational corporations is capable of. A spotlight from the prospective of those who are forced to suffer the imposition of change, an awareness that if the price to pay it�s too high, we will have to take a different direction. �Omo Change� could help us understand where to go. ITA - Omo Change � tutto questo; una documentazione, un grido, una riflessione, una consapevolezza, un atto d�amore per una terra che sta scomparendo e che ci fa vedere, senza filtri, di cosa l�uomo nelle vesti delle multinazionali sia oggi capace. Un faro puntato sulla prospettiva di chi � costretto a subire l�imposizione del cambiamento, consapevoli che se il prezzo da pagare � troppo alto, bisogner� intraprendere altre direzioni e Omo Change potrebbe aiutarci a comprendere quali. EN - Take part with me and FotoEvidence in the realization of the book, to allow this documentation to enter the memory of our time like a scream full of hope for a more sustainable world and to start reflections on how massive investments, hidden under the word �development,� could put at risk the balance between mankind and nature that were nurtured over hundreds of years. ITA - Partecipa anche tu, insieme a me e a FotoEvidence alla realizzazione del libro, per fare in modo che questa documentazione possa entrare nella memoria del nostro tempo come un grido di speranza per un mondo pi� sostenibile, e muovere cos� riflessioni su come degli investimenti imponenti mascherati sotto la parola sviluppo, possano mettere a rischio equilibri uomo/natura consolidati in centinaia di anni.

He says her death was suicide, She knows she was murdered, and not by the poor guy who ran her over. The relationship is a roller coaster of pain for both parties, but Nina is convinced she would never have killed herself and she can't cross over until M.C. helps her solve her case.

Last year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy treatment and multiple surgeries. This past year has given me so much to be grateful for and has also been a time of reflection and soul searching. I know we all struggle with ""a purpose"" but I truly feel this has all happened for a reason and I am meant to use my experience to help others and give back to the community. This wine bar is how I plan on accomplishing that. During treatment, I had a hard time finding places to eat out due to changes in taste and just generally didn't enjoy going out anymore. I felt people were always looking at me and judging (probably not, but you know what I mean by this). It would have been nice to have found a place in the community to gather with friends and family to enjoy a healthy meal and glass of wine (of course!) but this simply doesn't exist. I want to create this safe place. A place for people to gather and come as they are with a special menu filled with items suitable for someone who is going through treatments. It's the best way I can think to use my experience from this past year and pay it forward - benefiting the entire community. Wine with a purpose - what's better than that?! Here's where you come in. I can't do this alone. Please help me spread the word to assist in initial funding, or donate/invest if you feel so inclined . Every little bit helps!

My name is Bethanie Lynn. In the past I have worked as a tattooist, illustrator, jewelry maker, and photographer. However, my passion is in making the art I love, on my own terms. Started in March of 2019, Gutterfly Clothing Company has gained a lot of momentum in a short time. We have been selling hundreds of shirts through Pittsburgh local events and festivals. Gutterfly vendor table at a recent event. The Mission: Now, we are raising money to expand! Currently limited to graphic tees, this fundraiser will allow Gutterfly to expand into a full clothing line. We're talking pants, socks, shoes, hoodies, jackets, sweaters, and more! Your donations will help Gutterfly increase inventory. This fundraiser will also cover the initial financing for our own garment printing equipment. No more outsourcing! Gutterfly will soon be printing our graphics in house. Why Gutterfly? What makes Gutterfly so special? I am selling a LOT of shirts. Why? With a million different graphic tees out there to choose from, I decided to do something to set my shirts apart. Obviously the artwork is pretty cool and super unique, but it's also the traditional way in which the designs are made that sets Gutterfly apart from the crowd. Each shirt starts out as a raw pencil sketch. The art is then inked and hand colored with pencils. I use Photoshop to splice in some bits from my original acrylic paintings. The final art is scanned and screened onto shirts. Also, every design I produce is offered in a limited edition printing. Each graphic is printed a MAXIMUM of 100 times and then it is retired forever. In addition, all of my tags are numbered and autographed, making every Gutterfly t-shirt a collectible artist print. Tier 1: $25 or more This selection of graphic tees are available ONLY through kickstarter rewards. Each shirt will only be made a maximum of 50 times. The more pledges at this tier, the more exclusive shirts I will add to this collection. These shirts will never be available anywhere else but here! Get them before they're gone. Super limited run. No more than 50 of these exclusive shirts will ever be printed. Tier 2: $50 or more Tier 2 pledge: I will work with backers at this tier to create original graphics based on your specifications. I will draft up to 3 images for your selection. You'll get a t shirt of your customized design and discount pricing for any future purchases featuring your graphic. Have an idea you think would be great? Have a band or other organization/club that would love to have an original t shirt design? You can use this tier to promote your own cause! You get your own original shirt, and you can get more for reduced pricing. No expiration or limits! Great gift idea!

When your hands are free you can shake a hand, hold a baby, throw a frisbee, give a hug, high five or lend a hand.

You have already spent a lot on clothes, shoes and glasses to gear up for your trip and now it�s time to take good care of your NECK and SHOULDERS, making your trip EASIER and more CONVENIENT. WHAT BAG MATE MEANS Comes with an air cushion to make loads feel lighter, to relax your shoulders and to improve your posture. Featuring functional & hidden pockets for added convenience during your trips. When needed, It�s a spare pocket or can even be worn alone as a cross-body bag. It�s ultra-compatible and can be installed on any bags. Customizable to meet your own requirements. ""IT FEELS JUST LIKE WEARING A PAIR OF NIKE AIR SHOES ON YOUR SHOULDER"" We were inspired by NIKE AIR shoes to adapt our own, patented, AIR TECH for NEX, and have made a bag mate that is compatible with 95% of the bags on the market. This innovative design evenly distributes the weight across your entire shoulder, making loads feel at least 30% lighter, while keeping your neck, back, and shoulders aligned in a relaxed position to improve your posture. The interlinked Air System connects each individual air unit with nitrogen. This gives better pressure distribution, making your shoulder feel comfortably supportive. ""A PERFECT GIFT FOR ALL YOUR BAGS"" Thanks to our innovative wrap-around method, NEX will fit on over 95% of bag straps, camera straps, messenger straps and baby carriers, Which means no problems or headaches when installing. ""YOU CAN CARRY MORE, BOTH IN YOUR BAG AND IN THE NEX"" Our functional pocket is the perfect convenience hack for travelers, commuters, and photographers. It's expandable, meaning that it looks slim when empty, but is spacious when loaded. It can comfortably store your passport, power bank and phone at the same time. ""THE BAG MATE UPGRADES YOUR BAG INTO A $100 TRAVEL BAG IN JUST ONE SEC"" Access your phone at any time, even when it�s charging. Keeping your passport and flight ticket in your pocket is risky. Putting them in your bag isn�t much better, as pulling them out over and over again can be a hassle. NEX solves both of these problems with its functional pocket. It�s also bigger than it looks. Each strap has 3 inner pockets that can store all of your essential items, not just some of them. That means your charging cables, earphones, extra batteries, SD cards, lens cap and much more. ""A SPARE CHEST POCKET FOR MESSENGER AND CAMERA BAGS"" Want to use NEX as a chest pocket? Just pull it down and that�s exactly what you�ll get. This feature makes NEX perfect for messenger and camera bags. ""KEEP YOUR VALUABLES SECURE AND LITERALLY INVISIBLE"" We designed the hidden pocket to carry small everyday items like cash, keys, and cards. It is covered by the upper strap and is completely secured. That means never having to worry about anything slipping out, even if it�s upside down. An added benefit of it being hidden is safety. You won�t have to worry about anyone going into your pocket and taking your valuables. ""NO NEED TO CARRY ANY EXTRA BAG ON YOUR TRIP ANY MORE! YOUR BAG MATE IS THE ONE FOR YOU"" NEX also stands alone as a compact cross-body bag. All you have to do is clip it on and adjust the fit. Once it�s secured, you�ll be ready to go. ""A NIGHT RUN TOUR WITH NEX DURING YOUR TRIP IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO TRY "" Tighten your strap with the simple slide-up function. Once the fit is just right, you can use NEX when jogging or at the gym. ""A CUSTOMIZED NEX BY YOU"" NEX comes in black, red, blue, green, or yellow. Even better, you can mix and match your favorite color combination. This allows you to show off your personality and style while using your strap. <You will be able to choose your color scheme in a survey after the Kickstarter Campaign ends > ""DON'T WANT OUR LOGO ON YOUE NEX? NO PROBLEM!"" At Addon Design, we understand that some people like products with logos, while others do not. That�s why we keep our NEX strap blank. However, you can add on a velcro patch slot with a reflective velcro patch that can be replaced with your own patches later. ""NEX AND NIKE, THEY REALLY COST THE SAME "" The best-looking and most functional strap in the world is still a bad deal if it is low quality. Luckily, we construct NEX with the highest levels of craftsmanship possible. We even use recycled materials to make it Eco-Friendly. Spacious on the inside, 100% waterproof on the outside. NEX�s knitted mesh material is soft, has a good thickness, and incorporates Ultra-Cool Technology. The result is an incredibly breathable and comfortable wearing experience. Beautiful stitch free construction, with a natural, ergonomically designed shape. ""The air cushion is literally undestroyable"" You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Music has been good to me: I've traveled the world performing as a sideman with incredible artists like Joe Lovano, Quincy Jones and many others. I've been part of award-winning ensembles and have been featured on many celebrated recordings, one of them nominated for a Grammy award. But here's the thing: I've never recorded an album of my own. There are many reasons why that hasn't happened so far, none of them artistic...but I'll come back to those reasons later. The Music and the stories I've been writing music since I can remember and I've always felt that a good piece of music tells a story. Music, especially instrumental music, is an abstract art, and the story it tells may be different to different people. My idea for this album is to tell my stories, the ones that inspired the music and the titles: dreams, personal experiences, books that I read. Each piece on the album will be accompanied by a written little story about what inspired it and what it represents for me, the composer.Hence, Little Stories. The musicians I've chosen to convey these stories are some of my favorite players on the New York jazz scene. In addition to the traditional jazz piano trio and quartet formats, the music will feature a classical string quartet, bass clarinet, and voice. (...and back to) Why I Need Your Support As you probably already know, in the past 10-15 years the reality of the ""music business"" changed dramatically, especially for independent artists such as myself. In the era of Spotify, sales and revenues are down, and record labels are rarely signing new artists... But one thing remains constant: Recording and releasing an album is a very expensive endeavor. And, since I'm doing this on my own... Without a record label and its infrastructure behind me, I have to pay for: studio time, musicians' fees, mixing, mastering, publicity, printing, cover art and more...the expenses for a decent, no-compromise record are in the tens of thousands of dollars. I have, in fact already recorded some of the music (you can hear excerpts in the promotional video I've posted), but I still need your help to finish the album. I would like to invite you to be part of this project by pre-ordering the album, or choosing between the different reward options I'm offering: signed copies, lessons, sheet music, and much more. Please consider supporting and joining me to help my debut album come to life. We have one month to do this! If I don't reach the stated goal, the album won't get funded. Without your help, and in this current environment, this album wouldn't be possible. So please consider pledging if you can! Thank you! Peter Slavov"

I mean� do you really, really suck at guitar? Because that�s the name of this book! Clearly it�s fate. You Suck at Guitar is designed to be a brutally honest, completely ridiculous, and hopefully helpful way to kickstart (see what I did there?) your terrible guitar skills into slightly-less-terrible guitar skills. You can do it! Probably? If the mysteries of music have largely remained a mystery for you - then you need this book. If even picking up a guitar makes you look completely and utterly awkward - then you need this book. If you enjoy strangers (me) making fun of you from across the world - then you need this book. The key is honesty. Music books lie to you. They tell you that you are doing great, when, in fact, you are not. We here at Sadsap Music (that�s the name of the company I started to make these books) are more honest. Your friends know you are bad at guitar. Your lovers know you are bad at guitar. Even I know you are bad at guitar. So let�s fix it. Together. But not TOO together, because there�s no way I can stomach listening to you practice. I�m Dr. Joel Pierson, and I�ve made a career out of music and mockery. I�ve worked with some artists of great repute (New York Philharmonic, Kronos Quartet), and am well steeped in pop culture from working with artists like Wayne Newton and Ke$ha and touring with My Chemical Romance and Linkin Park. I�ve performed on all seven continents (yes, including Antarctica), written music for films (including additional music for The Internship with Owen Wilson), and had a recording contract with Warner Brothers Records. I have a Ph.D in music composition, and my music has been performed by over 20 major symphony orchestras. I once sat in with the Saturday Night Live band (I didn�t actually PLAY with the SNL band, I literally just sat with them while they played, in case there was a piano-related emergency.) Once I performed Let It Be for an audience of one: Paul McCartney. But enough about me. This book is about YOU and how bad YOU are at all things musical. Joining us on our craptacular journey is illustrator Jamie Chen, who I�m relatively certain is a real human being, like us. I have no reason to question that she was born on Earth, just like you and I. And it would certainly be inappropriate to assume that as a baby she was dropped off in the Bay Area by aliens in a wicker basket. So everything is completely normal with Jamie. Believe it or not, most music publishers think that mocking their customers is a BAD idea. Huh! So I�ve turned to Kickstarter for funding. 2 years ago my first book, You Suck at Piano, raised over $80,000. I followed that campaign up with 2 additional books: You Suck at Piano 2: You Still Suck, and 20 Piano Pieces for People with Emotional Problems. And now we tackle guitar!"

When I asked her what she wanted to do, she said that she wanted to do something to raise awareness about mental health issues (especially suicide awareness and prevention). So, we went to Hobby Lobby and started looking around. The idea she settled on was making ""worry stones"". We bought a bag of rocks (actually glass mosaic accent gems) and a cheap rotary tool and started carving them to give to family, friends and anyone who would take them. The first ones she made had semi colons engraved in them. (For those of you who don't know, the semi colon is to support suicide awareness / prevention because it symbolizes that the author (person considering suicide) could have ended the sentence (their life), but chose to pause and move on with the sentence (their life). MyRockAndI Semi Colon Many people find the rocks to be very relaxing. Some people leave them on their night stands, others keep them in their purse, pocket or backpack. And one girl I know has 10 of them scattered all around her world so she never has to look far to find one. Personally, I keep one in my pocket at all times. Every time I reach for my keys or change, I feel the rock and remember what it stands for. Mine says ""My Rock And I"", and when I hold it in my hand and rub my thumb over the letters, I remember that ""My Rock And I can do anything."" Every person has a reason to carry a rock, and they just need to find the right rock for that reason. One day I asked my students if any of them would like a rock, and 20 of them took one. We figured that they were just being polite and doing what their Professor wanted them to do, but we were encouraged to make more. Over the next week, other students started asking about the rocks, and some even asked if we could put other things on them. So, we experimented. Here are a few of the ideas we came up with: MyRockAndI Examples As the assortment of rocks grew, so did the number of people asking for them. And as the number of people carrying them increased, so did the feedback. When school went on break, the students took their rocks with them and posted pictures on social media holding their rocks and saying ""#MyRockAndI are on the beach in Florida"", and things like that. It was quite an experience for Jessie. One lady picked up a Breathe rock out of the blue one day, and the next thing she knew her daughter had an anaphylactic reaction and couldn't breathe. She posted a picture on Instagram with her rock sitting on her knee as she waited for word from her daughter who was in the ICU. Thankfully, her daughter recovered and everything turned out ok. The next time she saw Jessie, she gave her a huge hug, and they both cried. Another lady was doing volunteer training at a local hospital that specializes in treating children (I won't name drop, but if you can't figure out the hospital, send me a message and I'll let you know), and the staff noticed her rock. She had a Dot Dot Dot Rock (the three dots were a shorthand that we came up with for You're Not Alone) and when she explained it to the staff, they indicated that they would like to give them to the patients and families that came through the hospital. MyRockAndI Dot Dot Dots We made 100 rocks with three dots on them and dropped them off with Social Services so that they could ensure that they got to the patients and families who needed them. When we checked back with them later, they said that everyone (staff, patients and families) loved them, and even shared a story that one of the patients who was given a rock said that her three dots stood for her three reasons for living. They invited us to come by the following week for a Mental Health Awareness Month event, and we delivered another 50 rocks to them that day. MyRockAndI Delivery While we were visiting the booths at the event, we met the Chaplain. Jessie showed her the rocks we had brought for Social Services, and she said that they were amazing. When we told her about the Breathe rock described above, she indicated that she would love to have rocks to hand out to people who were stuck in the Emergency Room and/or Surgery waiting areas. We followed up with her the next week, and she indicated that she would like to have Dot Dot Dot and Breathe rocks for the waiting rooms because she felt that those would be most appropriate for those settings. We really want to fill this request. Why We Are Doing This Over the past three years, we have learned that Jessie is an Empath (MY terminology, not a diagnosis). Whenever she meets someone, she has an uncanny ability to get inside their minds and hearts... and not just understand what they feel... she actually goes there herself. When this happens, it is sometimes very difficult to get her mood back up to the point where she can function. This project has been so wonderful because it has allowed her to do something that impacts people's lives for the good without having to fully immerse herself in their emotional state and experience what they are going through. The vast majority of the feedback she gets is for the positive things that have come about because of her rocks, and we believe that this is the most healthy thing she has done since all this started. The objective is to figure out how to expand her reach without further draining the time, energy and resources out of her (and the rest of the family). Many people have asked how much she charges for them, but the answer has always been ""we aren't selling them."" Some have insisted, and we have accepted some money with the strict understanding that it will all be poured into buying more rocks that we can carve for the next person. It's just hard to think about making money when these things need to be out there regardless of the profit. (I told Jessie that I need to go on that TV show where you get investors, and I should make a deal with Mr. Wonderful. HE would make sure that the product went everywhere it could possibly go, and we'd make all the money we possibly could.) School is out for the summer, and we have been having discussions about whether or not she should get a job to save up for college next year. We both see the positive aspects of her taking that step, but we understand that her taking a job will pretty much mean an end to this project. We (and a lot of other people) have seen the power and positive impact this hobby has had as far away as Colorado, Florida and New Mexico, and we have been told countless times that we ""should sell these things!"" I think it's time to see if that is true. This project has funded successfully, and we will use the funds to purchase more rocks, a couple better (and lighter) rotary tools, bits, and pay a fast food kitchen wage so Jessie can work at home instead of working a job that doesn't make this kind of impact on the world. Any funds remaining at that point will be spent on advertising to drive more public demand so that the business becomes self sustaining. It is our hope that Jessie will be able to build this into an ongoing part time (if not eventually full time) job that she can use to save up for college. Potential Markets The potential in this market is almost unlimited, and if we can just capture 1/2 of one percent of it, we... Yes, Mr. Cuban?? Seriously... While being in three mental health provider's offices and an amazing hospital is a great start, we know that there are therapists, counselors and psychiatrists all over this nation who could use these for their patients. There are also doctor's office, Emergency Room, ICU and Surgery waiting rooms everywhere, and these rocks could be a great comfort to the families waiting in them. MyRockAndI Size We also want to serve the Military Veterans. Statistics indicate that we are losing 22 former service members to suicide EVERY DAY. That's 22 too many. Every Day. Some will argue those statistics, and all I will say is that ONE is too many, and leave it at that. These rocks should be available to every VA mental health service provider in the nation to hand out to their patients, and should be available in every waiting room in every VA facility in the nation. Thanks to the same lady who got the first rocks into the Children's Hospital, we are now in discussions to provide rocks to one of the nation's largest youth-centric non profit organizations to provide rocks to every attendee of their upcoming national convention. This would put 800 additional rocks into circulation via their ""swag bag"" that each attendee will receive. (If this actually happens, we might just be back here doing another campaign.) You don't have to have mental health issues to appreciate our rocks. The majority of the people who are carrying the rocks are just normal (as normal as people get in Southeast Texas) people who enjoy having a touch stone with them as they go through their day. Other potential markets include church groups, fund raisers, fraternities / sororities, sports teams and schools. They make great reminders of upcoming dates (weddings, vacations or the end of finals week) and for reminders of past dates (anniversaries, sobriety dates, etc.) We have even made rocks for a dear friend of mine to give out at a Celebration of Life that she hosted for someone who passed away. Full (and Absolute) Disclosure It is important to note that Jessie doesn't personally engrave every single one of these stones. This is HER project, but it is also a family affair (her mom, sister and I help out to get whatever needs to be done completed). This project is important to all of us, and provides a positive outlet for some of the stress that comes with being a family with two teenaged daughters in it. I can, however, absolutely assure you that she is intimately involved in the purchase of the rocks, engraving, cleaning, packing and shipping . She crosses paths with every single rock at some point in the process, and considers every single one of them hers. She also has a couple of really close friends who have been begging to be a part of this project, but we just haven't been able to utilize them because the demand hasn't been strong enough. We would love to include them if the demand gets strong enough. There are other ""Worry Stones"" out there on the market. Some of them are absolutely beautiful. They come in all shapes, sizes, and composition. You can even get them with your favorite saying, bible verse, images etched / pressed / painted into them. We aren't set up to do any of those things. Every rock we do is ""freehanded"" with a rotary tool, so the amount of information we can get on a rock is limited, and while we can do words and flowers, our ability to do logos or images is severely limited. We also have some smaller red and blue round rocks (a little larger than a dime), but they are only large enough for a flower, semi colon or Dot Dot Dot, and we are hesitant to put a lot of those out there because they could be a choking hazard if they got in the hands of small children. MyRockAndI Designs And sometimes we mess up. Jessie likes to say that every rock is flawed... just like her, and probably just like you! While prices vary wildly depending on what is on the other people's rocks, how they are processed and what they are made of, we fully believe that our rocks are more than reasonably priced. And we guarantee that every single one of them has been done with love and a belief that it is going to impact your life when you get it. You will soon be seeing them out there on Amazon, Etsy and the others so you can do a side by side comparison. A big part of the cost of these rocks comes from shipping and handling. Due to their size and shape, they have to be put in padded ""bubble envelopes"" (kind of expensive) to keep from chewing up the USPS sorting machines, and the postage is also expensive. We haven't shipped many because most of them have been hand delivered, but as we get experience, we hope that we will be able to significantly decrease these costs. For now, we are operating on the ""Ramen Noodle Shipping Rule"" and assuming that the cost of delivering the product is going to be higher than the actual cost of the product. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT MEANT TO PREVENT, DIAGNOSE, CURE OR TREAT ANY ILLNESS OR DISEASE. Success Looks Like MyRockAndI Eating Pho For everyone who made a pledge, we will donate a rock to a deserving organization for every one you get. We are expecting a lot of volume, so we will be focusing on the rocks that we know are popular. You will have your choice of Blue Oval, Black Oval, Purple Oval, Clear Star, Tinted Star (these are only slightly colored) or a Long / Bent Rock (these are clear with a colored center kind of like a marble). There are a few other options available, so if you aren't happy with the above options, just let us know and we will try to accommodate you as best we can. We will custom engrave which ever rock you choose with whatever you want (within reason and under 12 letters), but will give the receiving organization to option to pick the type of rock they want and what is engraved on the ones we donate. Goal : $500 Thankfully, this project funded at over 233%, and the money will be used to buy a couple new hand held engravers, bits and the blank rocks needed to create all the rewards for the supporters, plus all the rocks to be delivered to the children's hospital or non profit organization for distribution to the patients and families that need a little something in their hands to calm them and remind them that they aren't alone. Thank You for Your Help and Support We understand that not everyone could make a pledge, and some people weren't even remotely interested in the product we make. But we had 40 backers to the project, and met some amazing (and inspiring) people along the way. We promise to do our best to spread the blessings you have all bestowed on us with as many others as we can. Where To Now? We will be doing periodic updates here on KickStarter as we work through order fulfillment. After that, you will be able to go to http://www.myrockandi.com to order more rocks or find the links to our social media outlets. (Please know that the website may be up and down over the next couple of weeks as we build out an online store and work out the kinks that always come with that.)"

Kickstarter is �all or nothing,� so if we reach the goal, I'll be able to produce and offer all three designs of summer witches! If we don't, I won't, as I cannot afford it on my own. Stretch Goals (UPDATE: All stickers were unlocked! All backers will receive one of each!) Stretch Goal = $1,100: unlock Plant Witch sticker (was $1,500) Stretch Goal = $1,200: unlock Book Witch sticker (was $1,700) Stretch Goal = $1,300: unlock Crystals Witch sticker (was $1,900) This is the fourth pin: the Kitchen Witch. She'll now be available to backers that selected a mix 'n match pledge or level outside of the ""Full Set"" pledge, which specifies the designs you'll receive."

At HEX, we are all about creativity and expression. In fact, our motto is ""Equip The Creators."" We are always looking to make people's lives better by focusing attention on often overlooked details or needs. We felt this was the case for the comic and art industry. Having a legendary artist like Jim Lee in your contact list helps alot. As Jim explained his difficulties in traveling with his supplies, we all realized there was a need here. So we worked together to create the ultimate travel backpack for artists, The HEX x Jim Lee Artist Backpack... You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Comic conventions have become immensely popular events where collectors can gather to follow their favorite characters and artists. They buy, sell and collect comic books, posters, autographs, etc etc. Comic books are not kids business anymore as many of these books reach values well into six-figure territory. But there was no way to safely transport them. So we also made The HEX x Jim Lee Comic Collector Backpack... You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

ABOUT HEX: Music originally brought founders Dan Maravilla and Trent Valladares together as teenagers living in Southern California. Musicians and band-mates they perfected their craft working their way up the local club scene in Los Angeles. Their music style was eclectic - always seeking to create what was not the norm. Their creativity did not stop with sound, however. Both talented visual artists, they would outfit concerts into total sensory experiences by creating and performing original music as well as transforming prestigious concert venues with all-encompassing art installations - to provide a total experience. Clothing and fashion were also on the boys� radar, often repurposing and making their own clothing and accessories. After years in the music and art scene, they decided to launch a small, startup, family fashion business. Early collections gained attention from many world-renowned brands and they started designing and manufacturing for many established labels. This provided valuable opportunities to see inside many great companies and eventually give them the knowledge to be able to launch their own successful brand. Enter HEX. HEX is a creative community that draws from Dan and Trent's years of experience in fashion, music, and art and channels it to equip the next generation of creators through products that empower everyone to explore the outer limits of their potential. Everything HEX does is built on the foundation of its 3 core values of Innovation, Authenticity, and Community."

We want to create merchandise we're excited for, working with independent artists we're fans of, and support our communities in every way we can while doing so! We have partnered with Little Foolery artist Jayd A�t-Kaci to create a truly unique and beautiful collection of zodiac pins. Jayd is a critically acclaimed and accomplished artist, co-creator of Sfeer Theory and many other works. Every purchase from the Dual Wield Studio: Zodiac Pin Collection will directly benefit the artist and help us continue to collaborate on projects like this one. If we manage to reach $11,000 in funding, we will be offering the Zodiac Pin Collection as black & gold variants. Rather than unlocking each one individually, all 12 variants will unlock and become available for backers once we reach our $11,000 stretch goal! Learn more about the thought process behind each zodiac pin's design below as Jayd gives a short introduction to each sign and the symbolism behind her work. The sizing of each enamel pin varies from 1.1"" to 1.5"". The ram charges. Aries is a sign of vivacity, existence and life. Cogito ergo sum � ""I think, therefore I am."" It is not interested in anything other than its birth, and its purpose is nothing more than to live. It wants to experience, to interact, to engage, to pursue. For what doesn't matter, as long as the flames keep being stoked. As such, the pin was designed to be a wild flame and constantly facing forward � even the fur of the ram or its horns seem to be angled in the way of the flame that consumes it. The bull has been worshiped religiously across many cultures and mythologies, of which many are ascribed to Taurus. As a nod to the religious importance, the pin was designed with the aesthetic of a fresco. Flowers and sunshine surround Taurus, as this is the sign that ""stops to smell the roses"" � in other words, taking pleasure in life. It radiates serenity and peace, because, in spite of it being the sign of value and attachments, Taurus' priority is achieving a comfortable state of perpetual zen. The twins are ascribed to Pollux and Castor � one brother human, one brother divine. Since Gemini rules hands, the pin was designed with the focal point, the silhouette of the hands evoking the Sistine Chapel's Creation of Adam to show the relationship of heaven and earth, though it's hard to know which hand belongs to which brother, if they are reaching to touch or pulling away, or if the vacancy in the middle is a window to a different way of thinking or an empty purpose. The crab wants nothing more than to be protected and loved. The feeling of safety is deeply important to Cancer, and so it shells itself in. The crescent of the moon � the luminary that rules the sign of Cancer � is wrapped around the crab like a protective blanket against the dark, and it curls its pincers to itself not for protection but for comfort. Its rich inner world is only accessible to those who want to hug Cancer tighter than it hugs itself. You hear the lion roar, and you take notice when it does. This pin was designed with one word in mind: LOUD! The mane is the flame that lights itself and its world, and the rays of the sun protrude like an exclamation. At the same time, the sun is still a star, and Leo knows it is a star. It is the most golden pin of the set, as Leo announces itself in its own spotlight with great pride. But, as fierce as the Lion is, the effects that define it is almost cartoonishly dramatic, showing its loudness is for the purpose of entertainment and fun. Virgo is depicted as a maiden of the harvest accompanied by a dove, so for the design I merged them into an angel � of which Virgo aspires to be, a lot of the time. To be an angel means to be a divine tool, symbolic of a greater standard, perfected by service and purpose. Virgo wants to be useful and productive, ensuring a rich harvest for itself and wanting to inspire others to achieve the same. Even meeting Virgo's expectations halfway isn't in vain... you may never meet Virgo's standards, but if you try to even a little you'll be better than you were before. Libra is the air sign that introduces morality... Libra asks what is good and bad, what is right and wrong, what is fair and unfair. It is the sign that represents justice because it weighs the pros and the cons of all things, from all angles, from all perspectives. It does not like dispensing judgement until the scales have weighed evenly, and the verdict is perfectly balanced, accounting for all information and arguments. The pin's design has the scales balanced from an orb that looks like an eye � an eye that you can decide is either blind, or all-seeing. Scorpio is actually defined by its several phases, often condensed to three representations: the scorpion, the eagle, and the phoenix. The mythology has it that Scorpio evolves through all three, continuously, starting as a venomous arachnid, to a liberated bird of prey, to a legendary creature that is doomed to burn itself into nothing and rise again to do it all over. In the pin design, the scorpion is fanned as though spreading its wings, evoking the silhouette of a bird in flight. The colors start dark and black at the bottom, and grows in contrast until it reaches a spiritual discovery, a truth, and transforms. The centaur that always shoots for the impossible. Sagittarius is represented here as an archer whose bow makes up of the world itself. Even though the night sky is full of stars, Sagittarius isn't satisfied with being a star among them, it wants something more, though what is ""more"" it can't say. It takes hold of the edges of the very sky littered with the legends that came before it, pulls, and releases an arrow beyond what it can see and what we can imagine. The greatest adventure is one even Sagittarius itself doesn't know can be had. The sea-goat here is rigid, black, and intimidating. It's poised aggressively, though it is hard to know if it looking for a challenge or presenting itself as the challenge. The pin design is meant to evoke a number of things: is it a resident of the sea it occupies, or is it the ocean itself? Is it ambitious enough to climb a mountain, or is it the mountain itself? The answer is all the above, really. Capricorn makes the world to live out as king in it. The legend associated with Aquarius is one of Ganymede, a man so beautiful he was whisked away by Zeus disguised as an eagle, and was then made to be the wine-bearer to the Gods. The pin pays symbolic nod to that legend: a figure so beautiful it is hard to know who or what they are in terms of gender, age, or if they are even human � if any of that even matters, that is. They have the wings of heaven carrying them and their world. Their hair falls as water into the vase they hold, symbolizing the nectar of the gods and the well of knowledge. Aquarius rebels against what is defined, and asks us to drink so that we can rebel as well. The sign that represents cycle itself � it is the beginning and end, life and death, creation and destruction, the masculine and the feminine, the active and the passive, and so on. The revolving twin fish represent the dual natures of life, whatever those dual natures are, and how we're both trapped and set free by them at different points in time or growth. The pin is designed to evoke the yin and the yang, opposing natures that compliment and contrast and never stay still, but can only be whole and complete together. Our Kickstarter campaign will run for thirty days and end July 13th. Since we already have approved physical samples and a vetted manufacturer lined up, we can begin production right away! Pin production will take place from August to September, and we expect backer rewards to ship out from September to October. If at any point we run into any delays, we will be sure to communicate them right away. Stay in touch and keep up with the latest updates by following us below!

Our team has developed an entirely new way to manufacture coolers through utilizing a proprietary spray that was originally used to make the Pentagon blast resistant! Look All Too Familiar? The ONITIS weighs less than 10 pounds, so you can say goodbye to the days of needing two people to get your drinks down to the dock! Fun fact: The cooler derives its name from a genus of super beetle that has a higher strength to weight ratio than any other living creature on this planet. Thus, we thought the name ONITIS was perfect. Both sides of the lid can lock into place. So once you're ready to get the party started, you can flip the lid over and utilize the cup holders and cutting board. Strength Test: We used a lift to lower a 5,000 pound jeep onto the coolers. Overkill? Maybe. Ice Test: The following test was conducted during a week where average daily temperatures were over 90�F. Note: The particular prototype used was made of a modeling foam that has a weaker R value than the foam that will be used in our manufacturing run. In other words, the prototypes are less insulative than the final product. Arrow Test: For this test, a compound bow that fires arrows at over 300 feet per second was used. We decided to shoot a Roto-molded cooler as well for a comparison. After shooting both lids and side walls, the stopping power of the coating was clear. The ONITIS lid was able to stop the arrow dead in its tracks, while the arrow passed through the lid of the Roto-molded cooler. **Go to bottom of page for more tests** The dimensions and unique manufacturing process used ensure that the ONITIS never tips over. We know mama says not to compare... But taking a peak can't hurt. The harness is made out of high strength nylon webbing and is used as a way to fasten the lid down. Keep in mind, our lid locks into place without the security straps, but the straps are useful whenever the lid needs to be completely secured (i.e. if the cooler is barreling down the river, or strapped to the back of a four wheeler). The Military Grade buckles allow for a quick release of the straps whenever they are no longer needed. How Much Can It Hold? After playing around with the dimensions and rounding off the interior edges, we were able to get our final design to hold 64 cans with 20 pounds of ice. Our manufacturing partners are located right here in Georgia. From the molding of the cooler bases, to the application of the proprietary spray, these coolers are 100% born in the USA. The Harnesses are sewn at another facility in Georgia, so the final product will be assembled and shipped out from our distribution center in Atlanta. We've spent over a year running through trial production runs and we are ready to hit the ground running! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Please read Offensive and Defensive rules for more. You will have the chance to play many action cards that affect each roll. If a player gets an out or returns home after a roll. place them in a discard pile. When players are left on base and a team records its third out,The players on base will be discarded before the player that was up. If you play your entire deck simply flip over your discard pile and start again. SCORING and Winning When a player has moved around all the bases and returns to home they have scored a run. The team with the highest amount of runs after 7 innings is the winner. If the score is tied after the 7th, the game continues into extra innings. If the Visitors are winning in the last inning and the Home team cant score the visitors win. Home team always rolls in the last inning.

Now, we're back with the newest addition to the Sketchmark family! The Original Sketchmark was designed for journalers, designers, architects and artists alike. After receiving input from our backers, we created an expansion card with a focus on bullet journalers. Our new design features 3 journal specific tools to take your bullet journaling up a notch. Use the BUJO Expansion Card by itself or combine it with the Original Sketchmark for even more creative possibilities! After packing the Original Sketchmark with over 15 features, we designed the Bullet Journal Expansion Card to complement it, not replace it! We built a card with 3 bullet journal specific features that fit into a small, compact design. Paired with the features of the Original Sketchmark, the possibilities for your journaling are endless! The alphabet stencils were carefully designed to make it easy for you to add titles, dates, and more to your bullet journal! Our unique punctuation stencil allows you to easily create question marks, exclamation points, and periods. The stencils are designed to fit within two vertical rows of a 5mm x 5mm grid journal. Use the monthly tracker to keep track of all your habits! Track everything from your workouts, eating habits, sleep schedule, spending, and much more! Our unique design gives you plenty of versatility in creating your own trackers. Use the card as a stencil to create boxes for each day or use the card as a guide to quickly number your days in perfectly spaced 5mm x 5mm boxes. Unlike most stencils, we included 2 title boxes for more options! You can create amazing titles featuring letters and symbols when you use the alignment guides above the title boxes! Title alignment points make it easy to add icons and titles above your calendars. When drawing a title box, simply stop at one of the 3 marking points to include a 1, 2, or 3 letter title. For example, to add ""JUN"" to represent JUNE on your calendar, stop tracing at the alignment point with 3 dots to have the perfect spacing to fit your 3 letter title. A single icon fits perfectly when you stop at the alignment point with a single dot above it. Add some character to your bullet journal with our 10 journal icons! We included 7 basic icons that can be used to represent anything you want! We also included 3 journaling specific icons that can take on a few different meanings of their own. Each icon is designed to fit within a 10mm x 10mm box. Just like the Original, the Sketchmark Expansion Card doubles as a bookmark! Sketchmark�s bookmark cutout keeps your Sketchmark close to your journal at all times. Use it to mark your page in your journal, textbook, or book! Sketchmark isn't just for journaling. Use it as your primary bookmark to quickly underline key passages or use the journal icons to take notes and star, check or otherwise mark your book or textbook! Pair the Sketchmark BUJO Expansion Card with the Original Sketchmark! Launched in January, our original card has over 15 tools for journaling, designing and sketching. After raising over 1700% of our initial goal, input from our Original Sketchmark customers helped us bring the BUJO Expansion Card to life! We designed the BUJO Expansion card to complement the Original Sketchmark, not replace it! The features of both cards are designed to work together to give you endless possibilities in creating your journal. Watch our first Kickstarter video below to see all of the Original Sketchmark's features! Add-ons will be available following the campaign through Backerkit! Sketchmark's possibilities are endless!

It had been known by many names throughout the globe: Poles, Beersbee, Polish Horseshoes, Frisknock. Many different names, several variations of rules, different scoring systems and general gameplay guidelines that are usually unique to the owner of that particular set or the person who taught them how to play. Whatever the case, there has never been one official set that has unified all the different ways to play, all the different names it has been called, and eliminate the endless arguments of �my rules are the right rules� or �house rules clearly state...� until now! We are proud to present to you, the one and only, FrisBeer! No more: PVC pipes, Ski poles, tiki torches, tall lamps, lacrosse sticks, or fence posts For the last 2 years we have been perfecting our ideal depiction of how this game would be best enjoyed. It was very important for us to not only design a set that is �built-to-last but one that will be easy to set up, break down, stow and transport, aesthetically pleasing, and stupid simple. With efficiency, quality, and portability in mind, we believe that we have designed the most durable and user-friendly game that FrisBeer players everywhere will be proud to play. Every set contains: Two Custom collapsable poles with connectors Two plastic weighted cans Frisbee, designed to professional specifications Digging tool Ultra durable carry-bag The Poles: Both FrisBeer poles included in each set stand 5-feet tall, and are broken down into 3 pieces with 2 smaller connecting pieces holding them together. Our injected molded pipe is far stronger and more durable than your standard section-40 Industrial PVC which eliminates the worry of the poles getting damaged, bent or broken while it is thrown in the trunk of your vehicle along with all the rest of your belongings. The circumference of each pole was designed to the exact width of the bottom of any standard aluminum can which will allow your designated game can to rest comfortably on top of the pole. The Cans: We have spent countless hours engineering the perfect hard plastic mold of our official FrisBeer Cans that come with each set. We designed our game cans to match the specifications of the perfect size and weight of a beverage can filled about 1/2 up with sand. The can also matches the physical size characteristics of a standard aluminum can ensuring that if the cans become lost or stolen, any standard aluminum can of ay kind may serve as a substitute while ensuring the consistency of gameplay. ~ NO GLASS! We at ROVE Sports care very strongly for our environment and we saw it as our role to urge our players as well as fellow outdoor activists, to avoid using glass products to play this game or any other outdoor game in public areas. We designed the poles to fit any CAN in hopes that FrisBeer may act as just one more reminder to keep Glass out of our beaches and parks. Mahalo That's right. ANY. CAN. FITS. The Disc: We have been huge fans of every kind of disc sport out there for as long as we have been able to throw one. Disc golf, Ultimate, or even just for the �hey go long� game of catch. With that being said, we would not allow anything other than a 175 gram, USA Ultimate Disc League approved Tournament Official Size & Weight disc with our sets. Youre welcome. The Auger: You may be asking yourself, �What if i dont live near a beach?� �How will I be able to play if I cannot easily penetrate the pole into the ground?� We have found ourselves in these situations as well and we included a simple solution with our sets. If you have ever taken a beach umbrella to the park with you for shade and comfort, you would know that they usually come equipped with a drill-like tool attached to the bottom of it called an auger making it easy to penetrate the ground and provide a secure fitting to hold down your umbrella. We took this concept and have designed a lightweight and very easy-to-use auger that we include in each of our sets that creates the perfect size hole to secure the poles in any kind of penetrable surface. The Bag: One of the main issues that we felt was most important to tackle with FrisBeer, was portability. We designed a quality drawstring bag, big enough to fit all of the items included in the set as well as enough room for you to consolidate some of your other items you might be carrying with you. The double-stitch lining, and reinforced nylon interior of our bag ensures that it can take a beating and it will not lose its composure or undergo breaches or tears easily. 1. Easy Set Up 2.

You will notice that there are a lot of familiar rules set in place that you may recognize from some of your other favorite lawn games. Scoring  First Team to reach 21 wins  Your Team�s score must reach 21 exactly  Scoring over 21 results in a BUST and your score goes back to 15  RULES: Dropping of the Disc= 1 Point  Dropping of the Can= 2 Points  SNIPE RULE: If the Can is struck clean off the pole, and the receiving team FAILS to catch anything, the game is OVER and the throwing team wins Game on! Meet The Crew: We are Dan Venne, and Nick Romano and together we founded ROVE Sports LLC. We are a couple of best friends from Naples Florida who lived 2 doors down from each other when we were kids, and grew up playing sports and doing pretty much everything else together. We immediately developed a bond that grew stronger and stronger throughout the years, and if you asked either of us how we got so close, we would tell you its because we are 2 of the most competitive people you will ever meet. No matter what the task at hand, we were constantly trying to beat each other at whatever it was. Who could chug their Gatorade the fastest, who could win in a foot race, who could hold their breath the longest� you get the point. It was this competitive drive that caused us to constantly try to break the barriers of competition by putting ourselves through various athletic feats involving a combination of skill, luck, hand-eye coordination, and a high tolerance for beer intake. It was through this journey of pushing the boundaries that we discovered the beautiful game of FrisBeer. Along with the discovery of this game of games, we also discovered many flaws in how the vast majority enjoys this game. So for all you DIY beer gamers, and for you MacGuyvers of masterful displays of engineering wonder, we are proud and extremely excited to present to you the game that you ll be proud to play and to call your own. We give you FrisBeer. We hope you enjoy our game and we hope it gives you and the people close to you, a chance to enjoy some friendly competition while verbally assaulting each other with no mercy. Mahalo from both of us! Now get to playin. We'll see you out there"

My name is Valentina Raffaelli, I'm originally from Italy but I've been living and working in the USA for the past 10 years. I've always collaborated and recorded with bands, but I have never released a full length solo album, and I have never recorded one of my songs in a professional studio. This is the first musical project that I wrote, arranged and produced all by myself and I'm super excited (and extremely terrified) to share it with the world. Why I need you? I need your help to finish funding paying for mixing, mastering, graphic design, photos and the launch of the album. Phew. That's a lot! I had the budget for the first week of recording but I'm counting on your support to finish this by the end of July so that I can release it in March 2020. What is the album about? Bring On The Fire is a group of 11 songs about the end of the relationship with the person I moved to the United States for, and all the emotions that came from dealing with a difficult year. Not all the songs are sad and depressing. I'm hopelessly hopeful and I've been told I have a unique sense of humor. My songs reflect those aspects of my personality, even though they were written during some of the darkest moments of my life. I'm hoping my songs will inspire people that are not happy with their current situation to make a change in their lives, no matter how hard and impossible it might seem. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. It's gonna be alright (that's the title of the song that closes the album!). ""Bring On The Fire"" was recorded at Retro City Studios, Philadelphia PA. Sound, mixing and production: Matt Muir. Guitars: Kevin Hanson. Bass: Jim Stager. Drums: Erik Johnson. Backup vocals: Sara Mingle. So thank you, grazie, merci! Your support means everything to me! Tanto amore, lots of love! Valentina Sounds"

We've met y'all at breweries, cocktail and wine bars, even in private homes. Square Pie Guys have always been about building community through the shared love of pizza--and that meant getting our pizzas into your hands anyway we could. Whether that was a crazy electric oven with broken decks, hacked Rocboxx ovens meant for 90 second wood fired Neapolitan pizza, or a convection oven meant for keeping cookies warm, where there was a will there was a way. We might have fancy new toys to play with, but our mission is clear: make delicious food every time. That�s all gonna change with your help Earlier this year the demand started to outgrow the capacity of the pop up. In early March, we found the perfect space in SoMa, at 1077 Mission Street. Our vision is a restaurant for all occasions. From the post work crowd seeking a beer and some awesome food, to the date night over wine. An indulgent bday party with all your best friends, or the large office that needs their lunch or event catered, we're going to meet all those needs. You've reached out with all of these requests and in the past we simply couldn't fulfill them, but now we are proud to say we can. We're creating a warm, welcoming, vibrant space for our staff and guests. We'll finally be on delivery platforms, so when you want SPG you got it! What We Need We�ve been lucky to raise enough funds to get into the space and put down payments on the necessary equipment to keep slinging pies, and even luckier that our space was nearly operational when we got the keys. SPG has carved out a place in the Bay Area, which is why we need you our community, to help make it happen. We�re going on Kickstarter because our place wouldn't be complete without our communities final touch. We want your input, your thoughts, and your imprint on our new space. We know it�s been some time since our Vinyl pop up, and you must be ready for an SPG fix. That�s why want to offer you the chance to be a major part of our opening. Why Kickstarter? You�ve been with us through it all: the tiny smoke filled kitchen of Vinyl, the long lines at Harmonic Brewing, even the disappointing moments when we�ve sold out faster than expected. You�ve been witness to the incredible growth we�ve experienced and worked with us through all the kinks and adjustments. You know that our dedication, work ethic, and passion goes beyond the doors of SPG. Point blank: without your support over this past year we wouldn�t be here, and it�s exactly why we are turning to you, our community, to help get us through this last push. We feel beyond blessed to be able to pursue this opportunity and to have the support of our family and friends. Our Rewards We know part of a kickstarter is all about the exclusive rewards offered to those who are ready to take the leap with us. From newly designed schwag to one of a kind pizza experiences, we�ll have it all. There�s even the opportunity to design and name a pizza that will go on our menu! We want our community to enjoy these rewards both in our store and on the go. We believe in SPG and we hope you do too. The thing with Kickstarter, is that if we don�t reach our goal by the deadline, we receive no funds...zero. It�s all or nothing and we�re placing our bets on you! If you�re with us and ready to make it happen, please do so now. If you have ideas on other rewards you would like to see offered, email us at: info@SquarePieGuys. We also need you to get the word out! Text your friends, your neighbors, even your local dog walker! Send them this Kickstarter, follow us on IG and get ready for SPG to finally open its doors.

Homeopathy and Essential Oils. What are they? Chances are if you found this page, you may already have a pretty fair idea. Therefore, we beg you to be patient while I give a brief introduction for any newcomers. Homeopathy and Essential oils have been used for hundreds of years. While their methods differ, the essential idea is the same. both use all natural ingredients found in nature to help relieve pain, and cure certain ailments. Homeopathy uses the idea of Like cures Like, which is similar to how shots are made. Allergies acting up? A small amount of onion plant could for example help relieve symptoms to many common allergies. Essential oils uses everything from peppermint to lavender to fig to calm nerves, help induce sleep, among other things. As Pacific Northwesterners and Eagle Scouts, we cherish our environment and seek to build a sustainable world where we can use our natural resources around us. Woodworking Let's be simple, my twin and I want to share and sell our woodworking projects with the world! Since the early 1900s, our family has been into woodworking. Both of our grandfathers were avid woodworkers. They have built their own houses and workshops, tables and benches, bookshelves chairs, hope chests and so much more. Which brings us back to my twin and I. As millenials, we have limited space. However, we just got a house, craigslisted a bunch of tools and would love to keep this tradition and art alive. Too often, we see people our own age buying from amazon, or wayfair or Ikea. Wouldn't it be awesome to continue the local tradition of woodworking. Our heart is to see young individuals all over the world stepping back into local crafts and see the diversity and creative spark ignite our generation! We have had the bare bones shop up for 6 months, and have built several prototypes ranging from bookshelves to workbenches to swords to spice racks to essential oil boards. Which got us thinking, if we could kickstart the easiest thing to mail (essential oil boards, homeoapathy boards and other items) maybe we could make our dream a reality! To be fully ready for a bazaar, or a shop, we need wood for hundreds of projects up front. That is why we are giving ourselves a year. A year to save and to make and next summer, we will be able to sell all our things, both small and large, locally. We're giving you all a chance to be a part of bringing woodworking back! Homeopathy board Please consider donating, or helping by purchasing some of our smaller assorted items listed for sale. We want to keep the mailing cost reasonable, so we are sizing many of our products to take advantage of (if it fits it ships) boxes. Small, medium and large boards made out of whte oak, cherry and purple heart. So Why Kickstarter? You may ask, what made us pick this platform? Well, Kickstarter puts us in the unique position to be able to post our idea, and collect a group of people willing to invest in our project from around the US before spending hundreds of dollars on material. In our research, many Saturday markets require a capital of $1,000 between insurance, rented space and products just for 1 summer! Kickstarter allows us to sell to interested customers and work on raising funding and products so that next summer we will be ready to open a booth. Tiers and Pricing For specifics, please see our pricing on the right of the screen. We will be making Small and Large Homeopathy or Essential Oils Boards. Stretch Goals 750: Our project funding goal. Everyone will get the listed rewards! 1,000: If we make this goal, I will add a custom engraving on each board - like a name, or a message, or a quote. 1250: Wow! If we as a team can make this goal, I will have enough to buy a Planer for our shop!! this will let us smooth out our boards ahead of time without all the arduous sanding. As a reward, we will offer the choice for any board to be made of stripes of different kinds of wood (an oak board with a stripe of purple heart for example). 1500: Holy Cow! My dream of owning my own Lathe may well become a reality!! We can probably pick up a good used lathe, and as a reward, we will make each and every one of you either a honey dipper, mini rolling pin, or spice grinder - something fun!"

This healing balm has brought to life, an entire line of skincare products made from natural and raw products. The products are known under the With Love & Co. brand of skincare and healing products. Over the past two years and the sharing of hundreds of stories and much love, the With Love & Co. brand has grown. We have grown from one simple farmers market, to 8-10 markets per week and online shipments that reached as far away as Europe, Canada, and Kuwait and the entire United States. All of the success and the love shared with our customers, has created a calling to open a retail and production facility. The retail location will allow us to serve customers 7 days a week and 13 hours a day. We envision the retail location being an experience in itself and not the traditional product on the shelf and cashier environment. It will be an experience that integrates technology and personal genuine service, in creating a place that customers love to be in. It will be a place to acquire awesome skin, great complexions, and to share a story or two. We have started the process, secured the location and are working on creating the experience. Come join us and be a part of something young, and help continue to expand this all natural skincare revolution. Opening soon in the Downtown Summerlin Mall"

Thank you for joining us in growing this project. Today is the last day! With more funding, we will be able to bring in more writers, organize more events and workshops in more cities, and even begin to create original visual content to exist with our literary erotica. STRETCH GOAL: $12,000 Let's see how far we can go. Sex needs a rebrand. This is AURORE. AURORE is a curated community of feminist and queer writers telling real stories about sex, in their own way. AURORE publishes honest stories about people�s intimate experiences, celebrating the sex they loved, the sex that changed them, and the sex they want to reimagine. We solicit, encourage, and curate a collection of erotic literature that is as authentic and emotional as it is arousing. Our submission process guides new writers to take the plunge with their pen. Our ever-expanding community of talented writers includes first-timers, experienced writers like Zachary Zane, Laura Delarato, and Stoya, and regular contributors who also publish at places like The Advocate Magazine, Playboy, Vice and Vogue. Join us! We are raising funds to bring AURORE to its full potential. We've soft-launched the site, and now we need your help to get it fully operational and sustainable. Your contribution will go towards our badass and unapologetic writers and supporting new authors. We will grow our sexy literati by hosting writing workshops and book club events, creating safe community spaces for provocative storytelling. It's time to takeover the conversation. Join AURORE in telling new stories about sex. Ummm, How Do You Pronounce AURORE? Like Oh-Roar. It's French. Tell Me More About AURORE AURORE is raw and real. Contributors call the experience of writing real sex stories cathartic, healing, and tonic for their relationships. Readers report boners of all genders on the regular. Everyone agrees the stories provoke and reward. Our writers are people of all backgrounds, who use casual language, reveal subtleties, and mention hook-ups at local hangouts: the details of real-life encounters. No one is a professional erotica writer, and it shows�in a good way. Writing and reading AURORE content allows people to reflect on and discuss the kind of sex they�re having, the kind of sex they want to be having, and what their peers are experimenting with. Your support will ensure this project has legs to take its next step. AURORE is Vulnerable Each writer�s decision to �go there� opens the conversation for others, creating a trusted space. Sexiness is often narrowly portrayed. Somehow, telling the truth feels risky. We inspire and educate through our stories. They are ours to own. Founding AURORE I'm Carly. I founded AURORE in February 2019 after six months of restless dreaming and ideation. Since its inception, I have devoted one-on-one attention with each writer, editing to enhance their stories, and urging them to access deeper truths. I'm a writer, content creator, and kinda suddenly the founder of an amazing community. I started AURORE when my travel writing started to veer into the erotic, and I realized there was nowhere to pitch it. There are a whole bunch of sites about women�s sexual health and how-to type stuff, and of course a ton of spaces dedicated to cis-male pleasure, but nowhere existed purely to provide masturbatory material in the form of real sex stories to women and the queer community. So I decided to create a space for the content I wanted to consume. The word 'erotica' still has a kinda awkward connotation for a lot of people, which is puzzling, since porn is so pervasive, but I�m hoping to normalize that, and update the genre for smart, sophisticated readers. This one-woman initiative has already seen significant growth in audience, interest, and submissions�imagine what we can achieve when we build momentum! Thanks to the Kickstarter Creator-in-Residence program and countless favors from supportive fans, AURORE is now ready to grow. By backing AURORE now, you�ll be first to witness all of its transformations, word by word. Nom de Plume Another French thing! AURORE is named for the 19th-century author, Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, who wrote under the pen name George Sand. She was a woman attempting to succeed in a man�s world, and was known to dress as a gentleman to enter spaces restricted to women; by reclaiming her true name for the site, we give a wink and a nod to her true identity. Some of our writers follow this trend, donning pen names of the women they adore, imitate, and invent. Our boldness is in the story, our identities are in our expression, and our personal details are private. Our sharing is mysterious in all the right spots. Aurore is also the goddess of the dawn. Think: rebirth, light, hope. A collage mash-up featuring Aurore and Carly Why Support AURORE?

Supporting Writers Writing about sex is work! While AURORE is built out from the labor of love, we will only sustain if we fairly compensate our writers. Currently, AURORE publishes 4 new stories a month. When you back $50 or more, you will help us publish a voice. Workshops AURORE intends to create physical safe spaces in addition to our digital safe space, to discuss sex and relationships in a positive, supportive environment. Even though AURORE stories are focused on celebrating sex, we realize that things are more complicated. Facilitated by our staff and writers, we open the discussion. Book Club AURORE's Erotica Book Club selects a modern or old-school erotic work to read and discuss. Our meetings have already proven to serve the shared need for open exploration of sex and the issues around it, and future writing workshops and events will do the same. The Creators and The Future We're constantly working to make AURORE a beautiful, easy-to-navigate space with a solid business backbone to keep it thriving. Your support will ensure we can continue to focus on this worthy project, and keep operations running smoothly.

You may know me as Meorow on my social media. At the moment I am a college art student, and over the past year and a half I have dedicated the free time I have now to my dream project - the fully illustrated Celtic fairytale Sionnach Ab�: Fox Forever, also written by myself! I am super excited to have finally finished illustrating all 139 pages of this book, and I NEED YOUR HELP to get it out into the physical world! I want to print my baby, and through this Kickstarter I hope to gather the funds to be able to do so. Plus find new hands to give it to! Sionnach Ab� is an illustrated Celtic fairytale book, intended for all ages - everyone with a childlike heart and an eye for beauty. Every page is an artistic statement. The text, art, and story were all carefully crafted to form one cohesive whole, so that every page has a voice of its own, and no element is an accident. Every part was touched by hand and given careful attention. If you can appreciate classic fairytales of old, Irish folklore, medieval illuminated manuscripts, the Art Nouveau and Arts & Crafts Movements, and of course, nature, then it is my hope that you will love this book! Sionnach Ab� is Irish for ""Fox Forever."" I knew I wanted the title to be Irish, so I looked up the word for ""fox"" in Google translate, and the rest was history! ""Fox Forever"" is meant to reflect the theme of the book. The fox in the story never doubts. He always has a plan. His spirit can never be broken. Forever a fox. Sionnach Ab�! I had never cared much for fairytales personally. But after watching the movie The Secret of Kells, and a 2013 family trip to Ireland, I fell in love with the mysterious lore of the country. It all began in my college library. To pass the time, I casually picked up a book of Celtic fairytales, and thumbed through a story, but it did little for me. The plot was very predictable, and the characters flat and uninteresting. But one illustration of a prince and princess riding upon the tail of a fox, settled deep into my heart. I couldn't get the image out of my head - the specific detail of them riding upon the tail was so delightful. I went home, redrew the image, and simply fell in love. I wanted to create my own version of the fairytale, where the characters were actually people, with relatable emotions and motives. I wanted the fox to be a mysterious, mythical figure; otherworldly, almost. Most of all, I wanted to attempt to express through art and story my new love for fairytales and Irish folklore, and convey their old magic and beauty through a modern retelling. I wrote my own version of the story based on what I remembered, and discovered that the version I read was based off of the Grimm fairytale ""The Golden Bird."" But, mysteriously, I never did find that book again! It had utterly vanished from the library. Of course it did. It had served its purpose; it had cast its spell upon me, and I have never been the same. Set in medieval Ireland, Sionnach Ab� tells the story of one prince among three who ventures towards the ill-fated woods of Craugh to seek a prize to please his power-hungry father. Along the way he encounters a mysterious fox who offers him more than he could have hoped for. As is the case in most fairytales, things don't go the way they are expected to. The prince stumbles in his quest, by his own folly, yet, through his mistakes, he comes to question what he was really looking for after all. He is joined by the Lady Aideen, the fairest princess of the land, yet because of her beauty, her father kept her locked in her own chamber all her waking days to guard her from suitors. And throughout it all, the fox is forever faithful, forever grinning, and forever keeping them from harm. When magic prevails, fear falls away. The goal of this Kickstarter is to print 100 copies. Most of the money will be going towards the printing of the books. It costs a lot to print a full-color hardcover book! I will be printing the books through Bookbaby Self-Publishing. Here is the basic breakdown of the funds based off of the quote I received from them, and the additional shipping and Kickstarter fees: Thank you for your interest so far! Here's a little bit more about me written in the third person to sound official. Emily is a mixed-media illustrator, with a preference for digital art and watercolor. She is a recent graduate from Montgomery County Community College with an Associates in Fine Arts, and had the joy and privilege of being the Editor-in-Chief of the college�s art and literature magazine, producing the 2019 edition titled �Replications.� Currently she is in the process of earning a Bachelors of Fine Arts at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Illustration and books are her passion, and her professional aspiration is to be a children's book illustrator.

Our Indian counterpart Lazy Design Private Limited was a part of Qualcomm�s 6 month Hardware Acceleration program in Bangalore, India between August 2018 and March 2019 under QDIC 2018 where we connected with verified Electronic Partners and got some great Technical Mentoring. In addition this, we have won various Awards as a startup in the last 2 years. Scientifically, Aina is the Easiest, Fastest and the Laziest way to control. Anything. We are a team of Product Designers, Engineers and Data Scientists(collectively Gadget lovers) who got tired of swiping, tapping and unlocking our phones for every other thing and set out to find an easier way to handle tasks that we do on a daily basis. We spent the last 2 years in Research and Development to devise the perfect solution incorporating the latest advancements in AI, Acoustics and Microelectronics to create Aina. Aina is about 70% faster than your smartphone touchscreens and about 30% faster than Smart Speakers at getting Everyday tasks done. FEATURES, VARIANTS AND COLORS In addition to making a device that is super functional, being a team of Designers, we factored Aesthetics in our Design Process right in the beginning and as a result of this extensive process, we now have 6 beautiful variants of Aina, a color and finish for everyone AND we are now providing Free Global Shipping. Aina connects with your smartphone using Bluetooth 5.0 and works with our Aina app installed in your phone. Its controlled using 4 swipe gestures in 4 different directions on the touch sensing area of the ring that control Aina's display. These Swipe gestures are detected by a combination of Touch sensors on the Band's surface and Motion sensors inside the ring by algorithms that are trained and calibrated to your specific way of swiping on the ring. And whenever you swipe on the ring, you feel a subtle vibration as feedback. By using a combination of such a sensing and feedback mechanism, we avoid accidental inputs for the ring. In case you anyways activate a shortcut by mistake, you can swipe down right after the feel the vibrational feedback to undo that action. The home screen displays time and any recent notifications. AI shortcuts come as pop ups over the Home screen which you can choose to Accept, reject, snooze. You can also find the most relevant shortcuts for you by swiping left to right across the home screen. Swipe Down on the Home screen to activate your Voice Assistant and enter specific ""Modes"" by giving a Custom Voice Command to Aina. 4 Swipe Gestures to get Eveything done. We have partnered with multiple companies across the globe to bring some revolutionary technologies at your fingertips each packaged as a feature that we are introducing with Aina. 1. AI UI : ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACE AN AI REMOTE FOR YOUR SMARTPHONE After installing Aina app on your phone, you can select which applications you want shortcuts for. The app uses machine learning algorithms to learn your smartphone usage behavior related to the selected applications and Aina starts predicting shortcuts for you with significant accuracy within 3 weeks. The predicted shortcuts come as pop ups over the Home Screen of Aina which by defauly displays time, you can always choose to accept, reject or snooze the shortcut using the 4 swipe directions on the ring. And as you keep using Aina, these predictions keep getting more accurate. We have already integrated the API's of most popular regularly-used-Apps and will continue to grow our developer network to increase the capabilities of AIUI. Control Smart Home Devices: All popular smart home devices can be controlled using Aina through IFTTT. Book Cabs: We have already integrated with Uber and will be working with Lyft and other popular Cab booking services next.

The current prototype of Aina is 1.2x bigger than the final size of Aina, the main reason behind this is the absence of standard OLED displays of sizes that would fit inside Aina. The OLED Display used here is going to be replaced by a Custom made Curved OLED Display. The Charger Design shown here is not Final. Aina Ring Current Prototype(1.2x Bigger than the final size) Current Charging Dock(not the Final Design) The 4 latest prototypes of Aina Ring- The right one is the current version. Evolution of Aina Ring Aina is made by Lazy Co., a young Consumer Electronics Startup with offices in Bangalore and Delaware. We are a team of Product Designers, Engineers and Data Scientists who got tired of swiping, tapping and unlocking our phones for every other thing and set out to find an easier way to handle tasks that we do on a daily basis. We spent the last 2 years in Research and Development to devise the perfect solution incorporating the latest advancements in AI, Acoustics and Microelectronics to create Aina. Our Electronics partners in India and Taiwan have a cumulative experience of over 25 years in Electronics Product Development. Media Kit We started our Design process by studying the human body and its muscles to find out which would be the easiest motion in the human body that can be practically used to activate a shortcut. After a lot of Browsing the internet, user testing and surveys we figured blinking of eyes is too unreliable and Brain computer interfaces are still too far ahead, so we selected the next laziest motion the human body can perform- swiping the thumb over the index finger. Wireframes for the App and Initial Ring concepts We started sketching for finger based wearables and came up with crazy ideas of what all the ring can do, we definitely wanted it to take phone calls that would make the ring usable for a task that we all do on a daily basis. But we also had to make sure that the form factor we are trying to come up with is possible to make using the technology available today. First working prototype for taking phone calls- Jan 2017 So, while still in college finishing our major projects when we had no money at all, we started working on a Prototype of the ring using an RN52 Module and an Arduino Board and tested the use case of taking phone calls with the ring in addition to activating shortcuts through it. Designing the first PCB for Aina The image below shows the first design of the ring we were making. We know its horrible, but our PCB design and chipset selection was not very optimized then, and we had no funds at all. First CAD to fit in all the components The first working prototype of the Metallic Ring was able to take phone calls and activate some shortcuts in the phone, the App was being made in parallel. This prototype helped us test the practical battery life of the device and helped us realize that its actually possible to make Aina. Our first functional non display prototype- it was huge The cover made it look better(May 2017) RnD on Directional Sound - Our workspace used to look just Beatiful sometimes(Dec 2017) After finishing our research about what sound technology we should use out of 3 different alternatives, we started developing the Prototype on Qualcomm's Dev Kits and took some sweet time learning how to use it. After months of testing and multiple attempts at getting the PCB right, we finally came up with this 3D printed prototype of Aina which was super slim and was functional enough to be exhibited at our College's Open Day. This was the first prototype that was able to let you take calls by placing your fingertips near your ear using NFDS. 3d Printed Prototype with functional Near Field Directional Sound(March 2018) The main Challenge of building Aina was to put all the hardware components inside the small form factor. Once we got that done, we started exploring all sorts of applications this device can used for, using only the sensors and components which we already have inside the ring. This was the time when Google launched Google Pay which used Sound based authentication and ""Voila"", we partnered with Lisnr, Inc. to make use of this crazy tech which was far more useful and secure than NFC. Final CAD Design- May 2018 We kept working on the Final ID of the ring and came up with a Unisex design that complements one's office attire. We initially wanted to keep a full screen display on Aina's top but the battery and size constraints didn't allow that. That is where AIUI helped, because of which you won't need to select a shortcut from a long list of applications viewed on a big screen, the shortcut you need just pops up at the right time on the Edge Display of Aina. Perfecting the curves The Edge display was a crucial part of our Design, it was not just an aesthetic feature but it served a much bigger purpose of using the ring on a daily basis. Its strategically designed to be in your field of view when your hands are in a neutral or natural position if you are resting or doing a regular activity while sitting. Aina's first functional NFDC prototype in metal(Sept 2018) Yogansh diagnosing the Final PCB for defects Final Prototype(April 2019) - This is the fully functional May prototype of Aina, we have demoed this version at several places and people already love it. We are already working with EMS companies in India and Taiwan to develop our Prototypes. Once we get an estimate of the number of units to be produced after this campaign, we will be raising further investments, complete the final testing and start the manufacturing process.

I couldn't tell you how many hours of my life have been spent playing the Pokemon games and watching Ghibli movies - often at the same time! I wanted to make a pin that blended these two loves, and it all began with a sketch of my two favorite dragons - Haku from Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away and Pokemon's Dragonair. These two awesome dragons are wrapped around each other on a bed of glittery flowers. Alongside the pin are two smaller pins - a Pokeball and Paper Bird. The Dragon Pin is 1.75"". They are hard enamel plated in gold. The flowers will have pink glitter. Each pin has 2 pin backs with rubber clutches. They will have a small back stamp. Haku + Dragonair Pin The Pokeball and Paper Bird pins are 0.75"". These are hard enamel, plated in gold. The pink flowers will be glittery. They will have single pin back with a rubber clutch. Pokeball Pin and Paper Bird Pin Details on Pins **Please note, these images are not actual size. This is just for reference. About Kickstarter This is an All or Nothing campaign. You will not be charged until the campaign ends, and you will only be charged if we meet our goal. If we don't meet the goal, no payment is taken, and the pins can't be made. The goal for the campaign is based almost entirely on the production cost. The Kickstarter fee is about 10%, and that accounts for what isn't production costs. I am handling all packaging, backing cards, and such myself, so it is not reflected in the goal. This seemed the best way to keep the goal lower so it's easier for us to reach! Stretch Goals If we are able to make it to $775 or more, we will unlock the Shiny Version! This pretty version will be sent at no additional charge to anyone who pledged along with their other rewards! The Shiny Version will have a shiny Dragonair along with Haku, and the flowers will be teal and white with glitter. This pin will be silver plated. If we can take it even further and get to $1100 we can unlock new pin to the set! This pin features Chihiro and Dratini! They have the same pink glittery flowers as a backdrop. This pin, like the dragon pin, is gold plated and 1.75"". This will have 2 posts with rubber clutches and a small back stamp as well. If this is unlocked, it will be sent at no additional charge to everyone who backed the full set. Stickers! There are two stickers designed for this campaign! The first is a 3"" holographic sticker of the Haku x Dragonair Design! These are vinyl stickers with a soft holographic sheen.

I love how cute the little Haku and Dragonair turned out when I added them to the banner! SO, everyone who backs will be getting both of these cuties! (I'll post actual photos when they arrive!) Dragonair - 2""x2"" - Haku - 2.2""x1.8"" When It's Done If it all goes great, and we meet the goal - it's go time! It can take a few weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds. As soon as those are received, I will place the order with the factory. It normally can take about a month for the pins to arrive once production starts, and I will need some time to grade the pins and check for defects. I will make sure to ship the pins as soon as they can get out the door! I am as excited about this project as you are, so I'll do my best to keep you updated on the progress! I will posting every update on my Instagram (KatKachuArts). Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!"

I've written many songs over the years and I have selected several of my favorites to put on this new album and I can't wait to share it with you! This has been a dream of mine for a long time and this June is the time to make it happen! The last time I was in the studio was in 2011 when I was studying at the Contemporary Music Center in Nashville, TN. This June I am returning to Nashville and making a new album with some childhood friends. The money I am raising will help me to make the physical copies of the album and to help cut costs on expenses accrued during the recording process. I will still be covering a lot of the costs out of pocket and happy to do so! Thank you for partnering with me to make this album happen. I so appreciate each one of you, your encouragement, your listening ears and support. To hear more music from Bethany go to www.bethanyfonda.com."

CORRUPTED BY POWER. When Eridani's parents are murdered and their kingdom is seized by a traitorous duke, she plans to run. After she suffers yet another unendurable loss, the lure of revenge pulls her back. Eridani's brilliance as a strategist offers her a path to vengeance and the throne, but success may mean becoming everything she hates. To survive, she must sway religious zealots, outwit ambitious politicians, and confront bloodthirsty warlords, all with few allies and fewer resources. Yet the most menacing obstacle she must overcome is the prophecy uttered by a powerful sorceress: Everyone you know and trust will come to betray you. Click to download and read a sample chapter. Eridani's Crown is a 98,000-word standalone epic fantasy novel I like to describe as ""the character arc of Breaking Bad meets the atmosphere of Game of Thrones,"" and which some of the early readers have called ""a Greek tragedy masquerading as grimdark fantasy."" This book has plenty of elements that will appeal to fans of traditional epic fantasy. On the supercontinent called the Heart there's swordplay and prophecy, legacy of conquerors past and cults worshiping the forgotten gods. There's an ancient creature its keepers mistakenly think is a dragon, a portal that dispenses dangerous gifts from other dimensions, and a sword forged from the iron alchemists extracted from the blood of a warlord's slain enemies. But those of you who have read my work know that I haven't met a trope I didn't enjoy subverting, and that this novel will be anything but a cookie-cutter fantasy populated by stock D&D characters. Eridani's Crown features a full-on Cold War fought via economics, politics, and misinformation rather than spears and arrows -- something not typically seen in medieval fantasy. Among its cast of characters is a retired general turned pacifist who convinces kings and emperors not to go to war against one another. There's a storyteller who paints her tales in puffs of multi-colored steam. There's a healer that buys and sells illnesses as if they were precious stones... And plenty more I can't tell you about, because spoilers. Underneath all the cool fantasy stuff this book is about power, the choices and moral sacrifices people are willing to make in order to wield it, and how we as a society tend to eventually put despots like Alexander, Peter, Napoleon, or Genghis Khan onto pedestals. We assign them monikers like Alexander the Great or Peter the Great, even though any modicum of greatness they might possess was achieved by sacrificing countless lives. This book was born of trying to figure out what makes someone like Alexander of Macedonia wake up one morning and decide to conquer the world. And, of course, despots always have an excuse: ""As long as there are innumerable kings and princelings, all seeking glory and coveting the lands of their neighbors, wars will be endless."" -Eridani the Fierce Samples, and praise for Eridani's Crown Download and read an unedited copy of one of my favorite chapters. This is an early chapter, so it's mostly spoiler-free. Mostly. (Note: The text has been laid out by me. The actual book will be laid out by a pro and therefore will look a lot nicer.) Read ""Forty-Seven Dictums of Warfare"" at Daily Science Fiction. This was published as a standalone short story and is expanded within the novel. Spoilers for Teo, a minor but relevant character, as well as some other minor spoilers. Here's what some of my favorite writers who read the book had to say: With a world as intricate as the titular magical artifact and a cast of characters as morally complex as figures from real history, Eridani�s Crown is a nuanced examination of the drive to acquire power and its distorting influence on our ideals. This epic fantasy will have you turning the pages deep into the night and move you in the manner only the grandest of tragedies can. � Ken Liu, Hugo Award-winning author of THE GRACE OF KINGS A gripping tale of empire and conquest and the crumbling of good intentions in the pursuit of power. Shvartsman takes all your expectations and turns them on their head. � David Walton, Campbell Award-winning author of THREE LAWS LETHAL About the author I've been writing fiction since 2010 and have had over 120 original short stories published in places like Analog, Nature, Strange Horizons, Intergalactic Medicine Show, Fireside, Galaxy's Edge, and many other anthologies, magazines, and podcasts. My stories won the 2014 WSFA Small Press Award and were finalists twice for the Canopus Award for Excellence in Interstellar Fiction. You can see my complete bibliography here. I have two short story collections and a novella published, but Eridani's Crown will be my first novel! I have also translated a number of stories from Russian. These translations have been published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Apex, Samovar, Amazing Stories, and elsewhere. I've edited over a dozen anthologies, most of them published via my own press, UFO Publishing, but also by Baen Books, Arc Manor/Phoenix Pick, and Deoorc Enterprises. I'm also currently the editor and publisher of Future Science Fiction Digest, a pro zine with a strong focus on stories coming from outside of the anglosphere. Why Kickstarter? Publishing a book right can be an expensive proposition. This is my first, novel, a book I spent 3+ years writing, and I definitely want to do it right. That means hiring professionals to handle every aspect of the project. The gorgeous cover is by Tomasz Maronski, who has illustrated covers for any number of great writers, from Robert Silverberg to Brandon Sanderson. The audio book will be narrated by Nicola Seaton-Clark, who has over fifteen years of acting experience in TV, film, and radio. Copy editing, graphics design, interior layout, and all other aspects of production will be handled by equally-experienced industry veterans. $5,000 will cover most, but not all, of the initial costs. Raising more funds may allow for an offset print run, interior illustration, and other additional goodies that will result in a better book for everyone. The Swag This campaign is to fund the production of the ebook, trade paperback, hardcover, and audio book versions of Eridani's Crown. As such, most of the rewards will feature a combination of these items. However, I also have plenty of other books that I've edited or wrote that are in the mix. All of the following books are available as rewards and as add-ons and I can try and make substitutions if you want a certain reward tier but already have one of the books that it comes with. * You can add the audio book to any reward tier for $20 * You can add any of the following books to any reward tier for $10 each.

Two new rewards have been added! You can star on our back cover in a brand new illustration by Billy Tucci or you can pick up Mr. Tucci's original cover art for Vampire, PA: Bite Out of Crime! Scroll down for more details! WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN? Is that truly Lizzy Borden�s actual hatchet? What were those guys doing on the atomic testing grounds? Is that guy�s girlfriend�s mom really a monster? And what about that girl�s ex-boyfriends? They�re not literally monsters, are they? Welcome to Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. Not only do we answer those questions and more, we bring together an incredible roster of creative talent to do so in a spectacular 104-page trade paperback collection! This brand new book includes both the original Moonstone and American Mythology issues of Bedtime, as well as previously unpublished material in glorious, crisp black and white. We also add in an eight-page, full-color cover gallery! Jim Shooter, former Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics. Joe James, a comic book veteran from Milestone and DEFIANT, best known these days as an incredible storyboard and concept artist. Veteran artist Gene Gonzales, best known in comic book circles for his amazing Tales From The Cherokee. Mark Wheatley, co-creator of the Vertigo hit Breathtaker, First Comics� Mars, and the pioneering weekly Blood of the Innocent. James Kuhoric, Mr. Back-to-Press himself, the writer of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash and Army of Darkness. And we�ve got plenty more where they came from! HOW DID THIS COME TOGETHER? Whether in television or in print, anthologies have always grabbed my attention. When I was a kid, it was re-runs of The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits and Night Gallery. It was reprints of the great EC comics like Tales From The Crypt and Weird Science, and then I discovered their natural successors, Warren�s Creepy and Eerie. When I was in high school and taking my first creative writing class, I came up with the title for my take on the anthology series with twist endings: Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. It was the first screenplay I tried to write. That didn�t go far, but it also never left me. As time marched on, The Twilight Zone movie, several new iterations of the TV show, and a new Outer Limits came and went (and now there's a new Zone out there once again). Bruce Jones created Alien Worlds and Twisted Tales, very much in the spirit of the EC titles, and Steven Spielberg tried his hand with Amazing Stories. Finally, a new incarnation of Creepy arrived along with glorious reprint volumes of the originals. None of these things did anything to dampen my enthusiasm for Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. Through my comic book career I became friends with the Gaines family (that�s the estate of EC Comics founder Bill Gaines) and had a chance to assist with the beautiful EC Archives line of books, which we produced at Gemstone Publishing. I also became friends with modern-day owners of Creepy and Eerie. This did nothing but inspire me. Over those same years, I found out many of my favorite creators felt the same way, and they were glad to sign up for Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. UNCLE ALONZO Meet Alonzo Delvechio, also known as Uncle Alonzo. He's our host for Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. He's an unemployed construction worker in suburban Pittsburgh. After months of being pushed, cajoled, and flat-out nagged by his wife to find a job or start his own business, he decided to open a daycare center. And as soon as it was up and running, she left him. Which brings up a good question: ""Who�s more in danger, Alonzo or the kids?� That's a decision we�ll leave up to you! Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children - Standard Cover READY TO GO The best part about this collection of Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children -- beyond the stories themselves and their fantastic creators -- is that this book is just six pages away from being done And one of those six pages is the Thank-You page for our Kickstarter supporters!

She's also contributed to Vampire, PA, Vampire, PA: Bite Out of Crime, and the American Mythology issue of Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children. Bedtime Stories For Impressionable Children - Signed, Limited Edition HOW WE'LL SPEND THE MONEY WE RAISE Since all but five story pages in this book are already done, 100% of the funds we raise toward our initial goal will be spent on printing the book (more than 90%), paying for shipping materials and actually shipping the book (about 10%). If we raise additional funds, we'll pay for those five pages and then we will upgrade our product with additional cover treatments (if you saw how nice our Vampire, PA trade paperbacks came out, you know what we mean!). If we raise further additional funds, our creators who worked for no upfront page rates will share in them equally based on the page counts of their respective stories. It would be awesome if this was a ""problem"" with which we had to deal! ""All of My Ex-Boyfriends Are Monsters!

S. Eliot Self-reflection is a difficult process, at least it has been for me. And my artistic goals, like so many others, are those of self-expression through abstraction� in my case, through sound and time. So while painting the full picture, warts and all, can be the most challenging work, I�m starting to realize that for me it feels like the only work. My one time mentor (and musical hero) Danilo Perez used to tell us to �play what we don�t like about ourselves.� A tall order for any young musician, and it�s taken me a long time to fully realize how essential that advice seems to be. When he brought me to Panama and I was able to talk to Wayne Shorter briefly about originality, Wayne�s advice was profoundly simple: nobody has lived your life, eaten what you�ve eaten, felt what you�ve felt... if you can find a way to translate that through your work, it can�t help but be original. These two generous glimpses into their brilliance feel so tethered to one another, it couldn�t have been more obvious what they were trying to pass on. The music on this next record represents my latest attempt to honor that. Sitting with my fears, joys, insecurities, and trying to explain that process as best I can. I�ve asked some of my very favorite musicians, and dear friends, to help pull the music from the pages and into the air- Dayna Stephens on saxes and EWI, Edward Perez on bass, Colin Stranahan on drums and guests Ben Monder on guitar and Caroline Davis on alto sax. If I�m to present this music with the transparency and clarity I wish it to have, the process can be an expensive one. And so without pre-orders, independent artists are faced with a serious uphill battle when it comes to the initial production of the music itself. I hope that my music and goals are compelling enough that you�d like to purchase the record before it�s made� it essentially can�t exist without it. If you are further inclined to support my music, there are several interesting rewards that could offer unique insight into the process, and even more hands-on involvement should that interest you further. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, I know there are thousands of things tugging at your attention and it means so much that you would spend some energy considering my work.

Thanks to original sponsors like Agnes Gund, Lawrence B. Benenson, Rose Ciaola, Artsy.net, artnet.com, the Compleat sculptor and a major grant from the Annenberg Foundation�s/metabolic studios, Mister ArtSee is the first of a series of ArtSee vehicles that not only act as a mascot but also as a platform of awareness online and in real world engagement, for the arts, technology and design. Since its inception, the Mister ArtSee vehicle/project has brought exhibits, lectures, videos, presentations, classroom activities and is currently donating over 2 million dollars in arts education kits for thousands of children around the country. With your help, we can create and update Mister ArtSee as a National Mascot after 10 years of activities, so it can expand its mission of advocating for the arts and arts education across the entire country for many years to come.. Why is this important? Mister ArtSee has brought an important service for the arts and arts education. Besides proving to be an effective spokesperson in ways of engaging the general public, the Mister ArtSee project/organization has helped foster individuals and other organizations contribute to arts education through problem solving and collaborations that never before existed. As a resource and information hub, Mister ArtSee has connected donors to organizations without any restraints or organizational hurdles. Our mission Is simply to be an advocate for the arts and to help solve issues and create opportunities. Similar to the unbounded flexibility of our organizational activities, the Mister ArtSee vehicle has been developed as a work of art as well a space for art to maximize versatility, accessibility and expandability - a multipurpose art-platform, whose possibilities are limited only by the imagination of its participants. With your support, Mister Artsee can build and expand our mission and presence in the national culture at large. Mister ArtSee original collaborators - Elliott Arkin, Vito Acconci, Dario Nunez-Ameni What will your contribution support? After 10 years on the road, Mister ArtSee has seen wear and tear. Your contribution will create Mister ArtSee for the future - a new exterior, new outer covering, a new more environmentally friendly engine, sound and light system, and most of all, a newly designed platform and exhibition area for presentations and performances. These specially designed new elements will prepare and improve Mister ArtSee to go around the United States for many years. Most recently, Mister ArtSee was selected to receive an extraordinary donation, thanks to a committed private art patron, of over 100,000 art education books/kits published by Harry Abrams. Your contribution will directly ensure that we can distribute all these materials outside of New York along with a specially created series of art educational presentations in 2019 Why Kickstarter? What better way is there for a �National Mascot� to gain and demonstrate a national support than to partner with Kickstarter and accomplish our project? Kickstarter is a way everyone can get involved and feel a part of a bigger effort. We hope our �thank you� gifts will help everyone choose to participate.

I would always get several chapters in before realizing, ""this is not the direction I wanted this to go."" I had a feeling that someday the right book would just come pouring out of me. It did. All previous drafts prepared me to complete this book at this time in my life. With great pride, I have culminated six years of experiences and lessons that finally clicked into a cohesive story. I then worked with a talented team of proofreaders, including a professional editor from NYC, who tirelessly combed through the material many times to bring you the final product. This book has been simmering in my mind for years, with portions of it that I started working on as early as 2013. I love the final product and am eager to share it with you. What's The Book About? ""If The Poor Were Next Door"" is a short but compelling read. In about one hour, you will know my most intense life experiences and how they culminated in DonorSee. These are the experiences that shaped who I am, what I believe and why I have devoted my life to serving the poorest half of the planet. I do not hold back in this book. I don't sugarcoat any of the stories and I don't shy away from sharing my opinion. This is a redemptive book about some of the darkest moments of my life. Moments that have made me who I am. When you are finished, you will put it down with a brand new, refreshed, inspired and open-minded perspective. Why Do I Need Your Help? There are two major things left to do and I need your help to accomplish them: 1. The book needs a cover. I want to hire a professional designer who can help us make this book as beautiful as possible. The more intriguing the cover design, the more appealing it will be to new readers. 2.

VAT/GST For purchases outside the USA, customers are responsible for VAT/GST. Winston�s founder, Richard Stokes, was in the ad-tech industry for over a decade, most recently as the Global Head of Innovation for the media intelligence division of the world's largest advertising agency. In that role, he saw the industry move to embrace new technologies that track, mine, and sell private information (imagine every song you like, every relationship, every purchase you make, and every secret you have being stored forever in the cloud). That was the beginning of the omnipresent surveillance state. Rich decided this was not a world that he wanted his children to grow up in. It all came down to one question�if he wasn't the person to do something about it, then who would? That�s where Winston comes in. We founded Winston Privacy with a clear mission: to help Internet users take back control over their personal information. Comprehensive privacy is not only possible, it's realistic. Our team is made of people with diverse technical backgrounds and skill sets, and a deep knowledge of the state of online privacy. Our founder is an engineer by training who left a career in advertising after seeing firsthand the increasing abuses of personal data that are taking place. At Winston, we�re not only building products that put the power back into your hands, we�re also advocating for change. Our team began the Winston journey by shipping 20 beta units so that users could put our claims to the test. Now that we�re 100% sure Winston is ready for market, we decided to turn to the Kickstarter community for our official debut. We�ll use all of the funds from our Kickstarter campaign to fund manufacturing for the first large scale order and get privacy to your home. We can�t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Winston a reality.

Humankind has emerged from their bunkers following the War of the Five Factions. Across the barren landscapes lie mountains of steel, fields of metal, and vast expanses of damaged robots. To help rebuild Rennova to its once great glory, humans banded together and reconstructed robots. With disagreements about how to restore the planet, war broke out again between opposing tribes. Two Robots is a fast-paced, strategic card game of set collection and player elimination in a far distant future. Players in the game control Salvagers with special abilities attempting to build more robots with scrap robot parts than their friends. Be the first to eliminate all players or build Two Robots, the choice is yours. Check out the following videos or download the game rules below to learn more about how the game is played: Please note that we may make some minor adjustments, tweaks, and polishes to the layout so this version might not be final. We have bundled in some unique cards for you all that will live on as Kickstarter Exclusives and won't appear ever again. We refer to these cards as Forsaken Cards. They have a different back to differentiate them and are a piece of our heart to you. These have endured thorough playtesting and vetting, but ultimately were taken out of the game in favor of other things. Because of your support, we are bringing them back, just for you! Kickstarter Exclusive Edition design for the box cover  Centuries ago, light-years away, our ancestors, the people of Earth, were faced with the seemingly impossible task of surviving the impact of a meteor larger than any other in recorded history. In spite of their previous differences toward one another and the panic prevalent across the globe, the people came together and worked toward a solution that allowed many to escape the tragedy that befell their home. We, the people of Rennova, honor our ancestors in everything we do, for, if not for their efforts, we would not be. Two Robots takes place after many events have already transpired. Humans banded together and left Earth after a disastrous meteor was approaching. Escaping on a ship named Perstemico, they landed on a distant planet named Rennova, and proceeded to colonize it. Along the way, high technological advancements were achieved, robots were built, and war erupted between robots. In a daring attempt to quell the disaster, humans hid underground and unleashed a Xanadranium bomb, wiping out all that was above it, or so they thought. The year is now 2876, war has just ended, and humans are now getting back to the surface. A few robots remain, beyond them, scatters of robot parts strewn everywhere. The humans refer to these that remain as Salvagers -- and they are no ordinary robots. The radiation transformed them, unlocking powers in robots that humans never thought was possible. Tasked now with re-building their planet, humans relied heavily on Salvagers to build Robots again from scrap parts. The fields surrounding the once great city of Radixplor were too dangerous for humans to venture, the radiation preventing them from mining precious Tenaxium to power the rebuild. The Salvagers were sent out to bring these parts back to the factories where they could be constructed into Robots once again. However, disagreements on which energy type to build first escalated conflict once again. Tribes were forming, separating themselves from other humans and Salvagers alike. Are you curious about how Rennova came to be, or the origin stories of all the robots? Read our backstory! Click to read the full backstory to the game. Here we break down the stories behind each Salavger, the journey that humans took to Rennova, and everything in between. Here's a few overviews, reviews, and thoughts from the community about Two Robots. Keep in mind that the reviews are based on a prototype of the game. ""Thank you for the great review! This sounds like a fun game. I especially like the mechanic of the event cards counting as HP in the game. Who doesn�t like fighting robots?"" ""Two Robots is clearly a passion project. The backstory is creative and well thought out, and the concept art and final card designs are visually stunning. Combined, we think these guys may have the makings of a potential hit."" As well as getting the game and all unlocked stretch goals, we have some optional add-ons that you can purchase. All add-ons will be handled through our pledge manager, Gamefound. After the campaign has ended you will be receiving a link to sign up for our pledge manager, in this you will be able to tell us which add-ons you want, along with your shipping information for them. So how do you purchase an add-on? After you have selected one of our reward levels all you have to do is increase your pledge amount by the amount of the add-on. For instance, if you want to purchase a shirt and also the Rennovan Citizen tier, you would add $20 + $20, and have a $40 pledge. Keep in mind, all backer add-ons are free shipping. We'll take care of shipping! Shirt color options: Check the FAQ and tell us in the pledge manager which one you want :) We will be working with shipping partners within the US, EU, Australia, and Canada. This means that you will get region-friendly shipping and not have to worry about paying any nasty customs fees. Shipping will be $4 for our US based backers, and we will be offering a low fixed fee shipping option for all international backers. Keep in mind -- this fee applies to all tiers, regardless if you are backing 1 or 2 copies of the game. We are striving to keep shipping as low as possible! After the campaign has ended, we will send out a survey through our pledge manager in which you can enter your shipping address and payment information. Here's a breakdown of cost based on your location: US: $4 Canada, EU, UK, China, Hong Kong, Singapore: $8 Australia, New Zealand: $10 Rest of World: $14 The idea for Two Robots was built from a weekly board game night that Omar hosts at his house. We originally had set out to build a fully digital version of the game, and were quite far along. The night was wrapping up, we had just finished a string of games, and that's when the lightbulb moment hit. Our game could really be fun as a tabletop game. After that, we spent countless months calibrating and balancing the rules of the game through extensive play testing to bring you all something that we are truly proud of. If you want to see what we are up to, or get a behind the scenes look, follow us on one of our social accounts below! We are a distributed team with a home base in Austin, Texas.

Sit down and while you do your business, open to the first page and answer. When you're done, don't forget to wipe. 2. When your potty partner goes, they read your response and enter their own. Then they flip the page and start the next question. Two answers per potty visit (PPV). 3. The questions fall into 4 alternating categories: Trivia, Reveal, Hypothetical and Action. They are color coded to make your first grade teacher happy. 4. We've carefully crafted the journey. It starts out light and easy and leads to, well, interesting places. Skipping ahead ruins the fun, trust us. 5. There are 200 questions. Each pad should take roughly three months of healthy bowel movements to complete. Each toilet paper shaped pad of fun has 200 pages: 75 Trivia pages 50 Reveal pages 50 Hypothetical pages 25 Action pages And if your potty partner is out of town, there's a word search on the back to solo play. Over the last 18 months, more than 100 friends and strangers have played different prototypes of the game. The most common feedback we get is: We've also gotten these messages: Fair warning, if you share a potty with your grandma, you probably shouldn't play this game. First, it's a great time. You and your potty partner will grow even closer and have a blast doing it. Second, it's really DIFFERENT. Do you know of any other games that take place on the potty? Card games are played out. Strategy games are hard. This game is fresh. Third, you get a LOT of pages. 200 PAGES to be exact. It'll take roughly three months worth of potty breaks to complete the game. If we haven't convinced you yet, it's probably not for you. Go buy another Cards Against Humanity expansion pack. In 2016, we successfully funded our first game, CoolCats & AssHats: A Funner Way to Party. Since then, we've sold a bunch of copies to fun-loving people like you. Now we're back with our second game...Toilet Tag: A Funner Way to Potty. Before we got into the silly game business, we met working for a Big Tobacco company in the summer of 2007. We became friends and stayed in touch when we both moved on from pushing cigs. Working across the country, we built a game called CoolCats & AssHats. We funded it on Kickstarter and have since sold a bunch of games on Amazon. And we don't care what Jeff Bezos' dick looks like if you're wondering. If you're wondering what ours look like, we're both pretty average. Anyway, we're stoked to be back with another game we think you'll love. So, yeah, we wanna make this sucker real and we need your help."

It requires the original game to play. Inspired by the cheats and scoundrels of baseball history, Year III features Steroid Era all-stars, rules for throwing the World Series, and fully-updated rosters for the wonderfully bizarre Southern Circuit. It also introduces tweaks and updates designed to make the most elegant baseball game on the market even easier to play. I don't put projects on Kickstarter until they are nearly complete. As soon as you back the project, you'll find a 38 page preview of the new book in the first backer update. The PDF rulebook will be released at the end of June�just in time for the All Star break�and the hardcopy will be available soon after. You will not wait long to play this game. What Is Deadball? First introduced in 2017, Deadball is a lightweight baseball simulation designed by W.M. Akers (that's me), creator of the RPG Comrades and author of the mystery novel Westside. Popular with old school baseball cranks and children just learning to love the sport, it allows you to play a game starring players from today, the past, or your own imagination in around 30 minutes. If you�re new to Deadball, check out the free quick start guide and back this project at the $25 level to get the original game at a steep discount. If you love baseball, this is the game you've been waiting for. One hundred years ago, a group of Chicago White Sox players attempted to throw the World Series, creating a scandal that ended their careers and changed the sport forever. It is an ugly chapter of baseball history�and one Deadball couldn't wait to explore. Deadball: Year III allows you to simulate a game or series in which one or more of the players on the field are deliberately trying to lose. They will swing at bad pitches, get thrown out on the bases, and turn easy outs into horrendous errors. And with every mistake they make, the crowd�s suspicion will grow. These new rules are designed to put you in the heads of Shoeless Joe Jackson and Eddie Cicotte, who threw away Hall of Fame-quality careers in hopes of a dishonest payday. How did they feel when they tried to rig the fall classic? In Year III, you will find out for yourself. Along with the rules for fixing a series, Year III includes: An oddities table that seamlessly integrates incidents like balks, fan interference, botched calls, and animals on the field�without slowing down play New rules to simulate modern bullpen usage A revised Deadball scoresheet that makes it easier than ever to keep track of the action Rosters for the notorious All Stars of the Steroid Era A history of baseball�s bans and blacklists by John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball; a meditation on losing on purpose by USA Today�s Ted Berg, and a poem about the dead ball era by Nicole Callihan In Year III, cheaters never prosper�but they still have a marvelous time. In all of baseball fact or fiction, there is no league quite like the Southern Circuit. Fully co-ed and unapologetically eccentric, it features teams like the Paducah Red Birds, the Charlottesville Flycatchers, and the notorious Knoxville Grackles. Its players, owners and managers are drawn from the ranks of past Deadball Kickstarter backers, and it has been designed for fans who love the game's losers and weirdos as much as they do the all-time greats. This book includes complete recaps of last season, previews for the coming year, and two brand new Nine Game Pennant campaigns, which drop you into the climax of a pennant race and ask you to seize the championship or die trying. More than a fictional league, the Southern Circuit is an evolving story that you will bring to life. Pledge $40 to join the league as a prospect with a chance to appear in future books and redefine the Circuit forever. Everyone who pledges $10 or more gets a digital copy of the game, plus all the digital supplements and stretch goal materials, including: The redesigned scorecard, including pre-filled lineups for all the Southern Circuit teams An updated Quick Reference that puts all the new rules within easy reach A Steroid Era Quick Reference that allows for truly astonishing slugfests A partially-blank Oddities Table that you can fill with all the weirdest baseball stuff you can imagine: 10� beer riots, disco demolitions, and whatever else you desire Schedules and scorecards for the 2019 and 1911 Nine Game Pennant campaigns Pledge $15 or more to get the PDF plus a code to buy the print book from DriveThruRPG for the at-cost price of $4.96, and pledge $20 to write your name into the history books by naming one of the record-breaking legends of the Southern Circuit's Steroid Era, who are presented here in lineups for the 1999 All Star Game. This is limited to 25 spots, and the most talented players will go first. If you�ve missed out on past Deadball titles, this is your chance to get them at the steepest possible discount. Pledge $25 to get Year III along with PDFs and at-cost codes for the original rulebook, Deadball: 1909, and Deadball: Year II: an $80 value! Pledge $35 to get all four past books and to name one of those 1999 All Stars as well. (Limited to 25 spots.) Dreaming of a call-up to the big leagues? Pledge $40 to name one of the new class of Southern Circuit prospects. Use your own name, a loved one's, or the classic baseball moniker you�ve always wanted to see in the box scores. This is limited to 32 spots. The sooner you pledge, the better your prospect will be, and the more likely they will be to stick on the roster next season. As always, all rosters are coed. Prefer a spot on the bench to a place in the field? For $50, you can name and describe one of the eccentric skippers who rule the clubs of the Southern Circuit, one of whom is profiled on every team page. Join the ranks of Fay Harbaugh and Doc Pawlowski, and reshape the league in your own image. The at-cost price for past rulebooks is as follows: Deadball: Baseball With Dice � $3.24 Deadball: 1909 � $3.24 Deadball: Year II � $4.31 This does not include shipping or the cost of dice, which you can purchase for a few dollars online or at your local game store. Any set of polyhedral (or RPG) dice will have everything you need. Finally, if you're interested in trying Deadball but financial constrictions make the cost prohibitive, email me or message me on Kickstarter and I'll send you a free PDF of the original game. Stretch Goals At $5,000 (UNLOCKED!), I'll release Ancient Era Deadball rosters inspired by the larger-than-life characters of my novel Westside. At $10,000, I�ll release All Star rosters for the Southern Circuits of 2019 and 1911. At $15,000, I�ll record a �Let�s Play!� video for Deadball, explaining the basic rules and giving a peek at how I play the game."

It consists of eight 10-12 minute episodes to be viewed on the internet. Our goal is to create festival-winning content and fund an ongoing series that sparks thought, conversation, and feeling. SYNOPSIS Randall, a teenage survivor of a school shooting ends up in the cross-hairs of hoaxers who will stop at nothing to disprove the tragedy. Randall survived the Marquis Elementary school shooting five years ago, but his sister Julie did not. Their horrific story makes the family an irresistible target for the gun-rights zealots and hoaxers. Outside of the family�s grief, Randall is just another adolescent skater aspiring to Instagram fame alongside his friends. When he and right-wing contrarian Cynthia unexpectedly fall for each other, Randall begins to ask the conspiracy driven questions publicly that Cynthia has encouraged him to work through, setting in motion a quest that will test Randall�s relationship with reality, his family and friends, and his first love, Cynthia. Who's running this show? (Director's Statement) I�m a progressive humanist who grew up shooting guns. I believe that humanism is the greatest -ism out there. Lately, I�ve become increasingly disillusioned by our collective response to tragedies in our own home towns. Mass shootings were once tragedies that gave us pause, rallied us together and reminded us of our greatest power as a people; to heal ourselves. But, today, in this post-truth world, it is now acceptable to prey upon survivors of family tragedy for the sake of an ideology or an industry. Everything is fair game. Well, F* THAT. I appreciate our Second Amendment rights, but not to the detriment of our society. This series is a chilling glimpse of just how low some Americans are willing to stoop to quench their fanaticism. There is a power that takes root in our coming of age, and I hope telling this challenging and tragic story through the unvarnished eyes of a teenager will help bolster our courage as a nation. I hope this will compel us to embrace sensible gun laws� it�s not too late. Why do we need $20,000? We have a tiny budget and a tinier crew. This includes an immensely talented cinematography duo, a director who will also be running sound. Although they have been known to work for food and hugs, we do need to supply them with gear and snacks. Here is a picture of most of our wonderful group (cast & crew) with a few producers for good measure: After the first cast reading, hosted by Dumbo Salt Works, NYC The dedication of the cast and crew is unparalleled. Cast members are using personal wardrobe and taking on the responsibility of doing their own hair and makeup. Crew members are borrowing and lending gear without rental fees. Producers are doing double and triple duty for free. The director is even holding the microphone. Why would we do this? Because we believe in the script and how important it is to tell Randall's story. But, our assets are stretched and starting to show through like that one batch of lululemons. With the money you help us to raise we will meet the bare minimum of what it will take to finish this project. Here are some of items we need to ensure funds for: 1. Meals that that the director does not have to prepare with the few hours he is not actively in production. 2. The locations that every film needs but this production can't (yet) afford. For instance, a diner where our talented teens create the bonds that drive our story. 3. An on-set armorer to keep all of our fingers safe. 4. A professional post-production crew including a sound designer (especially since the director is doing sound). 5. An editor to make sure all of the hard days and long nights fit together seamlessly. The Timeline You are joining us at a very exciting time! Pre-production and casting are complete. Locations are locked. Principal photography is set to begin June 25, 2019. We are shooting at over 40 locations at an unrelenting pace for a total of 21 days. Our intention is to wrap post-production and share our series with you and the world by the end of 2019."

A company that puts compassion in front of profit?? That's who we are and hints at the way we work. The products we design and build are real solutions to problems trending in today's society. Porch pirates stealing Amazon packages that are all but useless (less than 5% can be resold). Shooters are entering our churches at will, they casually stroll into our schools and kill my babies. Can we not just combine existing technology into an all encompassing machine learned brain that does everything Star Trek did, but in a practical solution type of application. What about using algorithms or video recognition software to distinguish the shooter from a student ?? Our current ""system"" treats a cheerleader uniform no different from a trench coat killer. Why?? There are no systems in place today, unless you have luggage, travel documents, and a multi billion dollar airline industry to protect. My son and I had an idea for an invention. We had a package stolen and went to Google to find some kind of secured package delivery container for our front door, Google revealed almost nothing. Thus an idea was born. We tinkered with outdoor storage boxes from Lowe's...not perfect by any means--they didn't even have a hasp for padlock...Then we thought why not put a simple alarm in place on our front porch. The driver sees the message (logo / brand), places the box on the alarm; this activates the alarm through a weight sensor. We recently patented this idea--the device we are pioneering is now real, and we own it. These are crimes of opportunity that, with a little common sense, the use of readily available and simple technology, should all but put an end to your package delivery theft problems. During the design phase of the stop button we decided to form an LLC. and become experts in this greenfield market. Think Consumer Reports of alternative security technology. We now have an ever-growing team of IT/Web Builders/ Director of Charitable operations/ Internet Marketers/Mechanical Engineers/Social Media Interns/Office Manager. All team members have full time jobs elsewhere except our admin. Our team will come together into 1 SOMA office soon. Team members either currently own stock or have the opportunity to easily acquire. Stop 99 LLC. is a silicon valley startup with a different flare than most startups employ. We care way more about people--people of all shapes, sizes, and colors than we do about profit margins. Our earning capability is very LARGE, so we believe you don't have to step on people and crush their dreams to climb the corporate ladder. We wanted to become a company where people matter, where we are charitable, we give our time to great causes and we pioneer new charities of our own. Our own South San Francisco charity """"No home left behind"" -- where neighbors get together one Saturday a month and volunteer to cut the grass in the front yard for people who either can't get it done, or can't be bothered. Our goals are several 1. Keep our community beautiful by reducing perceived eye sores in the form of tall grass and weeds and 2. Make a difference for those that need us, and set a good example for the ones that ignore good neighborly standards."

All models share the same electronics and mechanics but differ in the type of gas sensor modules used. They provide applications in air quality, breath alcohol content, CO, CO2, Hydrogen and Propane/Methane/LNG measurement. The device�s LCD monitor displays gas measurement, device status, environmental temperature and humidity of surrounding air. Additional device features and options are alarm function that generates alarm sounds when gas level exceeds preprogrammed safe levels, Bluetooth option for remote monitoring and setup and no LCD option with Bluetooth. This device has internal rechargeable Lithium-ion battery that can provide hours of operation without external power based on type of sensor is used. Sound Alarm The AGDM316 device is equipped with a piezoelectric sound Alarm that beeps at 1 KHz with 40db sound level. The Alarm starts sounding at different beep cycles depending on gas concentration levels detected. For concentrations up to 10% above minimum level, it beeps half a second every 10 seconds. For concentrations of 10% to 25% above minimum level, it beeps half a second every 5 seconds. For concentrations of more than 25% above minimum level, it beeps half a second every 2 seconds. Air Quality Indicator Model AGDM316-10 This model has a wide thickness W type case. The sensor is suitable for detecting NH3, NOX and Benzene gases which are detrimental for measuring indoor air quality. The display for Air Quality device depicts a horizontal Gauge as shown above.

I believe we are in the midst of a global awakening and the consciousness of the planet is rising. As a teacher, healer, and spiritual speaker I am called to do my part to help people live aligned lives and heal/clear/transmute the sabotaging and toxic thoughts, beliefs, patterns, and habits that are keeping them from living the the abundant, healthy, and freedom lifestyle they dream about. This lifestyle web series focuses on clearing clutter on the 5 Pillars (levels) of living an aligned, healthy, and spiritual/holistic life. The video below is an example of a segment on de-cluttering toxins on the physical level by clean eating. This also raises your energetic vibration. Most people that want to transform their life start on the physical level, but they stop there and never make it to the other Pillars! THE DETAILS: The funds will be used to secure a videographer/ film and post-production student assistant from Scottsdale School of Film + Theatre at Scottsdale Community College and miscellaneous film equipment, space rentals, and social media ads. All interventions will shoot on location inside the homes of the people that are selected. Candidates will apply via online application and selected based on their desire, needs, situation, and level of commitment. By contributing to this project you are part of a global movement to raise conscious awareness and help people heal their lives and step into their authentic power and truth. Ideally, I'd love this to get pitched as a series on Netflix where I go into homes and do holistic lifestyle interventions to help people transform their life from the inside out! Production is slated to start in December 2019. Namaste! xx Sarah P.S. - The video below is pretty mainstream friendly. The series will also include metaphysics, energy and spiritual techniques that can be applied in a practical way. Overall the goal is to bring a holistic and spiritual lifestyle to the mainstream in a way that is educational, entertaining, and easy to integrate for the masses that are called to heal and transform their life."

The first is a story of renewal in a darkened future, a tale of queer love and a chance for redemption as two men, Pat and Theo, struggle with depression in a ruined environment. Theo knows they need to make a radical break with the past and start over somewhere new, but Pat feels this effort is hopeless. To buoy Pat, Theo tells him a story. The story Theo tells is one of the past, of loss and hubris, of art and science, of knowledge and morality, as a botanical glassblower mourns his dead wife. Haunted by her memory, he seeks solace in nature, which leads him on a fantastic journey. The two tales weave together, as both Pat and the glassblower struggle to find hope in despair and appreciate the beauty of nature. Pat and Theo The Glassblower Why This Film Is Important Film has the power to change perceptions. The pressing issue of our time, Global Warming, is a product of the view that the earth and nature are resources there for us to exploit. I hope this film can challenge that idea, and maybe shift the conversation towards working with nature, rather than against it. This film is also important because it pushes the boundaries of animation. It will made of 3d models, 3d scans from Harvard's Ware Collection of Glass Flowers, and rotoscoped actors shot on a green screen. For every frame we shoot, I�m going to create one drawing. This means I�ll be doing about 10,000 drawings to bring this film to life. Concept Art Garden concept art Director�s Statement I�m interested in exploring two things in my work: inequality, and nature. This film looks out how these things affect each other and us, whether physically or psychologically. I want to explore why we view nature as something to be controlled and wonder if humanity can return to a more loving and reciprocal relationship with the world. Until now, I've done so in a series of drawings and some short animations, but this is my chance to look at plants and people on a slightly larger scale. The ideas for the film came to me in parts, but a big inspiration was discovering the story of Leopold Blaschkha, who made thousands of glass flowers for Harvard in the late 19th and early 20th century. I was inspired by how he found solace in nature after his wife�s death, and by his amazing ability to perfectly recreate flowers from glass.

I have created a regional fantasy map for my ongoing adventure series, The Tarot Adventures. Unfortunately, I cannot draw or paint very well so I asked around and found an artist who was up for the task of creating such an important piece. This map was then artistically illustrated by Tania Gomez in full color and is now ready to see print. Available in both a players' version and a game master version (which has a handful of hidden locations), these maps are beautiful additions to your game or as wall art. Players' Map: Digital Preview image from printer site/ Artist: Tania Gomes This KickStarter campaign funds the printing and fulfillment costs for campaign rewards. All art costs have already been paid. What you get (I.E. Backer rewards!): Digital Map Pack ~ In order to make these maps as accessible as possible, I'm making them available in PNG for use in virtual tabletop applications. This file has been reduced to 12 by 18 inches in size to save on file size (we don't want horrible load times). This tier also includes a print on demand code for printed (12 inch by 18 inch) posters fulfilled through Drivethrurpg.com. The POD code will allow you to order the small printed maps, paying only the actual printing cost (presently 48 cents each) as well as shipping. Please note: Drivethru folds these once for shipping. The 24 x 36 inch maps for the higher level tiers are rolled and come from a different printer. Digital Map Pack and a Thank You post card ~ All the rewards of the Digital Map Pack Tier and a personalized 4 by 6 inch postcard sent to you from me. Note: These are sent as post cards, without an envelope, as postage would be prohibitive otherwise. Digital preview of 4 by 6 inch Thank you Card: Generated by printer's site / Artist: Tania Gomes Printed Player Map ~ Perfect for game masters who wants to put the world in the players' hands. Backers at this tier receive a printed (24 inch by 36 inch, yes it is HUGE) players' map poster. This will ship directly to you. Shipping is included for US addresses and an additional amount is appended in the pledge manager for addresses outside of the United States. Printed Player & Game Master (GM) Map ~ Backers at this tier get both printed maps (each is 24 by 36). The game master's version has a hex-grid and lists five hidden locations. These maps will ship directly to you. Additional shipping charge is appended in the pledge manager for addresses outside of the United States. Game Masters' Map: Digital Preview image from printer site/ Artist: Tania Gomes All printed maps ship unframed (which saves on shipping costs). Speaking of Shipping: Shipping of the large format maps within the United States and its territories is already factored into the reward tier. For backers in Canada an additional $5 is added in the pledge manager. For backers in all other countries an additional $8 is added in the pledge manager. This is to cover additional shipping costs that can arise. Backers are responsible for any tariff/taxes (VAT) that may arise. Why KickStarter? KickStarter is a fantastic platform. Sinopa Publishing books have been funded through the generous support of our backers. For this project, the KickStarter will help us determine whether we need to have a full offset print run done, or if print to order will be sufficient. We have no stretch goals for this campaign as it is a QuickStarter. Our goal is to bring this high-quality map to gamers far and wide and to have fun doing it. Where does the money go? Funds from this campaign go toward printing and fulfillment costs. Art has already been paid for. Any excess funds will be used toward future product development, which helps keep future project campaign goals low. How you can help: You can help our efforts by supporting the campaign at a tier that is comfortable for you. You can also help the campaign a great deal by sharing the campaign link on social media, on your blog/podcast/Youtube channel, and by telling fellow tabletop role playing gamers. Any and all support is appreciated. Thank you! Where can I get the Tarot Adventures? The Tarot Adventures, Books one and two of the series are currently available on Drivethrurpg.com.

Whether you�ve had a rough leg day, spent hours sitting in a cubicle, or just finished a marathon, SPRYNG� is the ultimate tool that you�ll love and use every day. What Is Active Compression? Active leg compression is a form of compression that mimics natural muscle contractions in your calves. It helps improve circulation, increase cellular oxygen supply, and stimulate tissue repair. Active Compression helps: By compressing your legs, you encourage circulation of blood where it needs the most support. This, in turn, can help reduce swelling and usher in fresh blood, nutrients, and lymphatic fluid to your legs to help accelerate healing and recovery. Supporting Circulation In Your Legs Due to gravity, your legs usually have the worst circulation in your body- especially if you�re standing or sitting all day. Without active circulation through your calves, blood will pool at your feet - resulting in swelling and pain. When your muscle pump remains inactive, you risk blood pooling, and inhibit circulation throughout your body (the blood in your feet is the same blood that is circulated through your heart and to your brain). This is why we focus on actively compressing your legs to help get that blood moving! The Benefits of Improved Circulation Active Compression is an effective way to improve circulation, flush lactic acid, and increase oxygenation to muscle tissues to get you back on your feet faster. Get more oxygen throughout your body and higher performance. Improved Circulation can help: Passive Compression Just Doesn�t Cut It You�ve likely encountered other compression tools such as socks, wraps, and sleeves. The main issue with these passive compression accessories is that they don�t do much when you�re in an office, plane, car, kitchen - anywhere you�ll be sitting or standing. Passive compression only provides support when you are using your muscle pump. In other words, they only work when you�re ALREADY active - in a workout or on a walk/run. This is where Active Compression comes in. Active Compression actively MIMICS the action of the calf muscle pump without you needing to do anything! The Beauty of Active Compression The Problem With Other Devices Current devices are ineffective or only accessible to professional athletes. These devices end up being bulky, covered in wires and hoses, not portable, and extremely expensive. They can have poor compression patterns that don�t use active compression, don�t match the muscle pump, or, worse, do more harm than good by pushing blood in the wrong direction. Bulky - complicated, heavy, not portable Expensive - reserved for high-paying professional athletes Poor Compression Pattern - dangerous and harmful The Power of SPRYNG� Using our patent-pending WaveTech compression pattern, SPRYNG� effectively mimics your skeletal muscle pump - which means it is the best way to help enhance your body�s natural circulatory flow. This means you get safe, powerful, and effective active compression that compliments your body�s natural rhythm. No reverse flow (which can get dangerous) - SPRYNG� makes sure your blood goes where it needs to go, the way it�s supposed to go, faster and more effectively. Patent-Pending WaveTech Pattern Our unique patent-pending compression patterns actively and gently push your blood in the right direction and work with the natural flow of your body. They do this by mimicking the skeletal muscle pump that acts as a second heart - aiding the return of blood to your core to help reduce swelling and muscle injury. You�ll feel your blood circulating through your calves, up your thighs, and through your body fluidly and powerfully. Relax as your body enters accelerated flow. Strategic Pneumatic Pressure We compartmentalized the compression areas to three strategic parts of your calf to make sure we help maximize blood flow and the efficacy of the compression. Feel the powerful massage hit just the right spots. Targeted Compression Affects Your Whole Leg Not just for your calves! Improving circulation at the lower extremities naturally helps push blood upwards through your thighs towards the heart. As a result, the lower extremities of your legs are one of the best targets to help improve blood circulation. Synchronized Compression SPRYNG� isn�t just synced with your naturally occurring muscle pump and blood circulation, it syncs with its adjoining pair automatically. Through the use of Infrared technology, each SPRYNG� device connects and syncs with its pair to give you dual active compression. The patterns in each leg will be synced up and matched, so you have a cohesive and comfortable session in complete harmony. 3 Levels Of Intensity Simply press the intensity button to increase or decrease the level of compression intensity you want. Internal sensors ensure SPRYNG� never pushes beyond your comfort, so you know you�re in good hands! Choose between two powerful compression patterns: 3 Steps To Setup Untethered Performance SPRYNG� is completely wireless and tubeless. You can use it in whatever position and any situation. Simply strap it on and let it run! There�s nothing to plug in or connect - a fully untethered experience. Compact & Portable Not only is SPRYNG� wireless, it�s also small and compact. You can easily fit it in your bag and even use it on a plane. Through its unique design and patent-pending compression pattern, you�ll get improved circulation throughout your entire leg with just a small area of compression. The device only wraps around your ankle and calves, so you can remain totally mobile without clunkiness or constraint. Feels Amazing Did we mention? SPRYNG� feels absolutely incredible! We honestly can�t talk about it enough. The pneumatic compression is like a a deep tissue leg massage that helps circulate your blood, pull out pain, and relax your entire body. Check out what users had to say about it! Long-Lasting Battery SPRYNG� has a powerful battery that can give up to 2.5 hours of active use. That means you can have up to 10 sessions before needing a recharge. The device can be easily recharged via micro-usb cable. One Size Fits Most Whether you have large legs or tiny calves, SPRYNG� has you in mind. We used a one-size-fits-most model using velcro straps to attach the device. The straps are fully adjustable, so you can switch sizes quickly and easily. Machine-Washable Sweaty legs? Not a problem! The inner layer of SPRYNG� can be removed and is 100% machine washable. Sustainable & Affordable Pneumatic active compression used to be reserved only for professional athletes, universities, and the uber-rich. Now, we�re bringing its performance enhancing powers to you for a tenth of the cost (that�s 90% off)! You�ll not just be getting the same effects, but you�ll have it better, faster, and much more portable than the rest. Throughout this process, we were heavily influenced and inspired by video games. We loved the artwork, design, and mechanics found in these fictional, digital worlds and wanted to create a regeneration tool like those seen in games. With SPRYNG�, we believe we got pretty close. Naturally, we felt our outer layer skin designs should reflect this achievement. So we designed our outer skins to have four unique colorways that draw homage to our favorite video game experiences. SPRYNG� is your real-life power boost and looks it too! SPRYNG� isn�t just for athletes! If you stand or sit a lot, you need to get blood circulating to stay healthy, relieve tired and achy legs, and help increase cognitive performance! This means Spryng is perfect for everyone! From DJs to Moms to CEOs and gamers, get higher level performance across all areas of life! We want our backers to have a great experience with SPRYNG�. We are doing everything in our power - from sourcing the best quality materials to rigorous quality control processes - to ensure that we would get the best product into the hands of our backers. As we are just starting up and offering SPRYNG� at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we are only able to accept returns due to manufacturing defect. Several years ago our team was focused on looking at one significant leg condition � diabetic neuropathy. When we dug deep into the realms of neuropathy we realized that a method called active compression could be a wonderful solution to this. That took us down the route of looking at active compression and the technologies we could use to achieve this. In our journey, the more we researched, the more we realized that active compression could not only offer a potential solution for diabetic neuropathy, but it had far more expansive potential therapeutic effects. It was something that could benefit tens of millions of people all over the world. Sadly, a lot of the active compression solutions that were out there were either very very expensive or were used in hospital settings that were inaccessible for many people. We wanted to do it differently. We wanted to bring active compression to everyone out there. Hence, we created Spryng! Through Spryng, we want to bring the benefits of active compression in an easy to use and affordable manifestation to all of you! This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them."

Thistledown: A Human Story . . . In everything I do, I try to bring people together. I've made tabletop RPGs to bring families and friends together, and I've made coloring books designed to be colored together. With Thistledown, I've written a story about the most uniting human experience - pain and tragedy. I believe that all of our differences, all of our strong opinions and theories about how reality work, all the things that divide us, fall away in the face of pain. I experienced this first-hand when my wife was diagnosed with cancer after years of remission � people we didn't even know stepped up and took care of us. They supported us, fed us, and encouraged us. Our pain stripped away the cultural/political/societal barriers, and united us at our core - as humans, who suffer and comfort those who suffer. There's nothing that unites us like the experience of pain. Thistledown is about anthropomorphic animals, fairies, and magic. But it's a very human story. The conscious suffering that we experience like no other living creature does is perhaps the most human experience. Thistledown is an attempt to touch that experience, and tenderly examine it. I also believe in the healing power of creativity - working on Thistledown helped carry me through unbelievable difficulty, stress, and fear. If you have a creative ambition, artistic pursuits can do the same for you. I hope to serve as an example and an inspiration for those who have creative ambitions: creativity isn't just something that you can do while going through tragedy, it helps you recover from it. Thoughtfully written. Thistledown assumes that games have the capacity to tell a real, true, beautiful story, so we've poured months into writing, analyzing, and refining the story. I contacted the smartest and most creative people I knew to be a part of the script advisors, and I listened to their advice with both ears. Thistledown is orders of magnitude better because of their input. Story only mode. There's a 'story mode' that you can toggle on at any time, which removes most of the platforming challenges and all of the combat. It's an important goal of Thistledown that the story can be experienced by anyone who wants to experience it. Attention to characters. I believe that everyone has a unique story to tell. I've worked hard to animate and create unique portraits and personas for every character in our 60+ cast of characters. You won't meet any 'generic' people, just as there are no generic people in real life. A deep, expansive world. We sought to make a world that felt real and bigger than the story itself, so we put in major work building the world of Thistledown, only 10% of which will be in the game. We made a world that feels like you are only glimpsing a bit of it, because you are. Thistledown is a platformer and a visual novel, or a story-heavy RPG. It's inspired by countless other works. Here are some of my favorite stories and worlds that informed Thistledown: World: Cave Story, Redwall, Middle Earth, Tooth and Tail. Story: To the Moon, The Wind Rises, In This Corner of the World. Theme: The Book of Sorrows, Watership Down, Firefly. Magic:Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Ra. We'll be revealing more information about all of the different members of The Animalia (a catch-all term for the different animal races in Thistledown), as well as the different kinds of Fovos (magic folk, fair folk, or faeries) as the campaign goes on. We'll cover those most important to the story of Thistledown, only a portion of the peoples of Thistledown. The Kouneli (Pronounced co-nelly) Organized in small tribes and families, the Kouneli are humble creatures, living in burrows and using their limited magic to encourage plant growth. Magic:The Kouneli have a small life well of magic, which they can impart to plants, encouraging growth. Every year in the spring, each tribe of Kouneli concentrate their magic to grow a guardian thistle, a symbolic protector, which grows to the size of a redwood. The Kako Feral, meat-eating rabbits, who file their teeth to points and dock the ears of their young ones. They frequently raid small villages and will feast on their genetic cousins, the Kouneli, without remorse. There are very few who know how they came to be this way�in Kouneli myth, the Kouneli gained consciousness and split from the Kako Bloodline many ages ago. They are generally albinos or jet black. Magic: none. The Erpo The Erpo are white foxes, living a secluded existence in the mountains. They reside in insulated canvas yurts, which are improbably fashioned into towers. Probably takes magic to get them to stand up. Probably. They are constantly driving back the hordes of Kako threatening the world. Magic: The Erpo are powerfully magical, second only to the High Fovos in magic capability. They are one of the only races of the Animalia who can practice magic without a contract with a Fovos. The Klosi The Klosi are the most technologically advanced race in the world of Thistledown. They had magical powers once, but almost all of their abilities were taken away from them when they angered the wrong High Fovos. The only ability left to them: they can spin anything. No longer having access to their magic, the Klosi turned to technology, using complex systems of gears and pulleys to create a giant city in the trees. Magic: They can spin things. No straight lines. Just spinning. The Asvos The Asvos manage the countless magical contracts that the magical folk forge with less- or non-magical folk. They�re the contract lawyers of the world. Magic: None, although powerful deep magic protects the contracts they manage. This allows the Asvos to hold the (incredibly powerful) High Fovos accountable. The High Fovos The High Fovos are a group of incredibly magical, long-lived faeries. None of the Animalia know what they really look like, but the form they generally take is that of an 18th century human. They wear powdered wigs and enjoy showing off their finery. They torment the Animalia as much as they can. Magic: The source of nearly all the magic in the world of Thistledown. If a member of the Animalia wishes to perform a magical feat beyond their abilities, they have to sign a contract with a High Fovos or a Low Fovos. The High Fovos are a poisonous race, and they will often try to cause harm to those who sign contracts with them, just for their own amusement. The Low Fovos The Low Fovos come in many forms - from flying lizards to sleepy, hill-sized golems. They are significantly less magical than the High Fovos, but have some power. The pixel art in Thistledown is a work in progress. I use a lot of moving layers and parallax to create the illusion of depth, and to flesh out the world: Lighting layers allow me to adjust the lighting precisely to create depth and contrast with colors. Objects fade as they go back in space, and shift in color towards the sky, the ambient light. I've drawn tons of giant set pieces, that really flesh out the world and make it intriguing. Each statue and building has its own history, a reason for being in the world: Did I mention mood? The art in Thistledown oozes the mood of the story. The environments, weather, etc. all contribute to the story. A personal tragedy forces Oni to push beyond the borders of her village, in search of an unspeakable evil. As she assembles the pieces of an ancient magical contract, Oni leaves a bloody trail behind her, careening towards darkness, death, and worse. Thistledown is a story first. The stakes are high, but only for our main character. It's not the story of a summer blockbuster. She's not saving the entire world in an epic showdown with the villain, she's just fighting for her life, and her family. She's getting kicked, and persevering. When I first posted about Thistledown online, the first comment was from Sam - ""I am already a huge fan. Going to drop you an E-Mail"". Sam Jones has been an ardent supporter of Thistledown since the beginning, and has written lovely, thoughtful, beautiful music for the soundtrack. Who are we?

You're the best. I love you. The state of the game Thistledown's script has been written, the main character designs have been fleshed out, and most of the major systems are built. What comes next is a whole lot of pixel art, animating, and building cutscenes. Why kickstarter? I've been working on Thistledown for a year and a half. I believe in the story, and eventually I would finish the game, even without Kickstarter. However, I would like to recoup some expenses of development and publication, and I would like to pay something to the people who have helped me make the game what it is. At the minimum funding level, I would fulfill pledges first, and then devote any money left to those goals. If we overfund, I will be able to devote even more of my time to the game, and can add additional areas, stories, and free DLC stories based in the world of Thistledown. I want to be able to expand on my vision. Whether or not this happens depends primarily on you - I don't have a publisher (Doubtful Games is my own company), or a marketing budget. If you believe in Thistledown, please share it. You'll help to make it bigger and better than I can do alone. If you're in the middle of tragedy right now: If you're facing medical bills, or the kind of financial struggle that tends to accompany unexpected tragedy, there's no need to back this Kickstarter. Contact me here, let me know what's going on if you wish, and I'll send you a copy of Thistledown when it's done. It's the least I can do. The Wall of Gratitude I'm so incredibly grateful to anyone who backs this campaign. You're literally helping make my ideas reality, and I can't thank you enough for that. As an extra way to say ""thank you"", every backer will get their name drawn on the wall of gratitude. It will be a digital wall, with each backer having their own space, regardless of how much they contribute. I'll upload the wall to the internet in many places, thus immortalizing what you've done for me. Maybe for a stretch goal, we'll make a real, physical wall of gratitude. That would be sweet. Maybe we'll name it Wall-E... Or Wall-G, ""G"" for gratitude.

Thistledown Poster *not final design The poster: but should it have Oni and Wyrm on it, or illustrations of all the races of Thistledown? We'll do a poll mid-campaign to choose the final subject matter. Either way, it will be big, shiny, and beautiful. Work with us to make your own character in the world of Thistledown. You'll decide race, distinguishing features, name, dialogue, and whatever else you can think up. I'll create your character in the finest pixel art, and put them in the game for you to find. The Low Fovos come in many different flavors, so to speak - there's nearly endless variety to these 'lesser' faeries. From tiny dragons to sleepy monsters the size of a small mountain, the Low Fovos are everywhere. Design your own, work with us to come up with backstory/history/etc. and have your new creation incorporated into the lore and canon of Thistledown forever. A major creative challenge, work with us to design a race - to be incorporated into the canon of Thistledown forever. You decide: The animal that they're based on Habits History Magic use Customs Oh, and everything else. We'll help you refine the race to fit into the world of Thistledown, and they'll be incorporated into Thistledown: A Tragedy of Blood with their own unique area. - - - Social media Follow the development of Thistledown on these channels: Twitter YouTube Discord Website Money back guarantee If you're not happy with your pledge, let me know. I'll make it good. FAQ Platforms? PC/Mac to start with, Steam Keys included. I'd like to support more platforms in the future. How long will the game be? I'm not adding padding (poorly thought-out, un-fun gameplay designed to make the game feel more valuable) to Thistledown. I hate it when I have to waste time playing broken, terrible mini-games to get on with the story. Thistledown won't be a long game, and it won't be infinitely repayable. Probably no longer than 2 hours, unless we add extra stories through stretch goals. Do you accept PayPal pledges? Yes! Here's the link: paypal.me/andhegames. We will honor all available pledges through this link. (Don't pledge for something that's currently unavailable, please!) Why is the goal so low? I just am looking to pay for production and publication costs - I'm doing all the art and code myself, and I'm not trying to pay anyone's salary. - - - Business card psd created by freepik - www.freepik.com"

This book not only walks Roxy through her visit to the dentist, but it also shows how Roxy works through her emotions about going to the dentist. The book really works to show children it is okay to express how they feel, but it is equally important to be strong/ brave and go through the experiences with a positive attitude as well. My name is Katie Melko, I have a Master's in Science and have been a dental hygienist for 10 years. I fell in love with writing in my graduate program and love animals. Roxy was my furbaby for 12 years before she passed away and she was the inspiration for the main character. Being a dental hygienist in a public health setting, I really saw how much the dentist was feared by children and adults. I wanted to take the opportunity to write this education and fun book to help eliminate that fear factor for families and for parents to use as a resource to help prepare their children for there first visit. I hope to be able to share my message and continue to publish books like this to help families better prepare their little ones for appointments or visits that can cause anxiety and fear! The money raised in this kickstarter will be used to help launch the second book in the series; Paw Elementary: Roxy's Adventure to the Hair Salon. I hope that you will help me make this series of books a reality by helping me fund my next book! ~Katie"

A built-in server allows access to the panel from browsers running on computers or mobile devices. Custom functionality is achieved with the graphical programming editor. Hardware Design The LabRecon Breadboard Experimentor allows LabRecon to interface to the real world. The device can be configured to realize various combinations of the following: 8 Analog Inputs (12-bit, 0 to 5V) 1 Count/Frequency Input 1 Quadrature/Frequency Input Pair 7 Digital On/Off Inputs/Outputs 4 PWM Outputs 4 Servo Outputs Outputs for 2 Stepper Motors I2C interfaces for 24bit ADCs, 12/16bit DACs, port expanders BBExp2 Schematic Detailed, open-source hardware documentation is available. Design Custom Interfaces Easily A fully configurable strip chart allows historical data, for up to 20 parameters, to be incorporated into the Web page. The Web page is built by dragging customizable objects onto LabRecon�s Web page editor �Panel�. LabRecon generates HTML/HTML5, CSS, and Javascript on-the-fly as the page is built. Simple Take on Advanced Programming �Back end� functionality is graphically programed by adding and wiring functions on LabRecon�s �Wiring� window. Functionality can supplemented with code written in Java, Javascript, C/C++, Python, etc. using LabRecon�s CodeLink feature. The Code Link feature allows the incorporation of code from Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and more in order to extend wiring functionality. The built-in Remote File Transfer allows editing of the web page on the server from a remote location. Educational Application LabRecon serves as an environment where you can create any simulation using the software to visualize it and use it as a teaching tool. There are dozens of sample projects, such as the simulation of trajectory with drag forces, included for free within LabRecon software with no external hardware required. Trajectory with Drag Extensive Databases of Components LabRecon�s �Measurement Wizard� uses a built-in database of over 500 commercially available sensors to help the user select and interface to sensors. This helps free the user from being tied to a limited set of compatible modules. Integrate with Mobile Devices Built-In MQTT Broker Cross-Platform Compatibility Windows, OSX, Linux* *Linux versions require Wine to operate. Application Showcase Thermostat By measuring the relative temperature and humidity in a room, you can monitor them using this thermostat to track changes over time, get notified when temperature falls below a point, or even control the temperature directly through LabRecon software. Sentry Tank Bot Web-controlled bot with a camera attached. You can move the bot by controlling the direction and speed of the movement, and rotate the camera. Model Rocket Launcher Customized model rocket launcher which allows you to control the launch angle. Other peripherals such as lights and alarms are attached which respond to the controls for the rocket. Photovoltaic Lamp LabRecon controlled photovoltaic lamp. Nerf Gun Nerf gun equipped with a humidifier to simulate fog, a servo that allows rotation of the device, green and red lasers, a webcam, and a spotlight. The gun is accurate enough to easily knock down empty bottles at a distance of 15+ meters. Mouse Trap Miller Urey Hurt Jacket Fish Bot 3D Printer Production The Breadboard Experimentor started as a mostly through-hole board and evolved to a primarily surface mount board to lower production costs. The LabRecon chip on the breadboard was moved to the circuit board to free up breadboard space. Four boards are laid out in each panel to lower the cost of board assembly. An initial run of boards from our contract manufacturer. The Backstory The hardware and software developer, Joe Barbetta, had originally developed custom controller boards for fuel cell applications, such as hydrogen powered cars. These controllers had a simple text based interface and Joe became determined to create the best GUI (graphical user interface) possible. The software evolved into a fully customizable GUI combined with a graphical programming environment. Joe was also driven to make the best possible graphics so users can create beautiful GUIs for their projects. The Breadboard Experimentor was envisioned as a convenient platform for users to interface their projects to the LabRecon software. About Me Joe Barbetta, founder of LabRecon Years ago, Joe Barbetta had a moment of inspiration while atop the Great Pyramid in Egypt, to design the best measurement and control software. At the time, his fuel cell controller boards were being used in one of the first hydrogen cars and various military and government projects, but they used a simple serial text interface. After writing over 250,000 lines of code in assembler, VB6, C, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, his software has evolved into a rich development and simulation environment with its own graphical programming language and IOT (Internet of Things) capabilities. Joe Barbetta has also been an adjunct professor at Stevens Institute of Technology since 1997 and has been mentoring high school seniors from the Bergen Acadamies since 2000. He can be found in his lab in the Englewood, NJ industrial park."

He was sick with a disease called pyoderma gangrenosum, which prohibited him from any rough physical activity. During his early twenties, he fell into a depression and gained hundreds of pounds which limited his mobility. We were very close. I was his confidant and his health care surrogate. When he was hospitalized, I would fly to California to make sure he was receiving the best healthcare. When I saw him lying in the hospital bed I was mortified, he gained so much weight that I did not recognize his face. All I could think of was how to get the fat off him and get him back to living a healthy life according to his standards. I became so involved with his weight issue that I overlooked his beautiful smile and jovial personality. My conversations with the doctors were about his weight, not his internal health. My brother found humor in the smallest things, but not me he was overweight, and I had to fix him. Meanwhile, he was dying, and I did not realize it because I was too busy worrying about the fat that consumed his body. I returned to the East coast to resume unfinished business three days later I received a personal call from his Doctor, he urged me to return to the hospital as soon as possible. I had received urgent phone calls from Doctors since he was a kid. Therefore, I was not alarmed. I received another call at 3 A.M from a nurse stating that; ""My brother had passed away."" The thought of not seeing him again hit me like a ton of bricks. All I could think of was his charming smile and humorous personality. I spent the last days with my brother trying to fix his weight, when I should have been nurturing his spirit. Project Purpose Based on the core concept that humans are intertwined with an internal need to connect.This project is an exploration and documentation of the human spirit; which we all share. While the film will highlight Damien Smith's journey to lose weight, the broader focus of this project is dedicated to documenting why and how people are driven to support Damien. His story of perseverance is a vehicle that inspires and unites a collection of people to lend him their assistance. The project will highlight the values and motivations of Damien and his community that seek to inspire, support, and encourage him throughout his process. This project will illustrate through interviews and testimonials that a person's journey is communitive. My qualifications as a filmmaker enable me to produce a compelling and inspiring story to encourage people to explore the Human Spirit. My goal is to influence people to realize that no matter how much fat consumes the exterior, the interior is longing for an honest stimulation of the human spirit. Loneliness combined with helplessness can bring forth depression and possible suicide; therefore Community intervention and understanding can prevent the human spirit from dying. My resources are reliable and astounding; that's why I am positive that I can produce a film that will globally resonate with people."

They may play these goblins in their Encampments however they like. (1 / 3, 2/2, 4/0). Players may also purchase upgrades at this time. Movement Phase: Starting with the player with the King's Ear, all players in turn order move their goblins one hex toward the castle. If the goblins are next to a castle unit at the beginning of the movement phase they will not move. At the end of each player's turn if that player has a goblin next to a castle unit, count the total number of goblins surrounding it. If the number meets or exceeds the goblin icon number on a castle unit, that unit is destroyed and that player gets a stone. Castle Phase: The player with the King's Ear flips the top card of the Castle deck and takes whatever action is shown. (For instance, if they flip a Castle Unit, they would put a Castle Unit hex into play.) Then starting with the player with the King's Ear, players may purchase castle cards with stones that they may play or hold in their hands. Each castle card costs +1 stone for a player to buy, so the first player to buy a card costs 1 stone, the next costs 2 stones, until all players pass. Conflict Phase: In the conflict phase, the castle will kill 1 goblin in each hex adjacent to it. All castle units will also kill goblins based on their attack regions and range. (See above, the archer kills 2 goblins in each hex in a straight line of 5 hexes. The knight kills 2 goblins in each hex adjacent to it in a 3 region arc.) Victory: At the end of your movement, if you have at least 1 goblin next to the castle, and there are 5x the number of players in goblins surrounding the castle, the castle is destroyed. (If there are 3 players and I have 5 goblins next to the castle at the end of my movement, and the other players have 10 or more, we have hit the victory condition of 15 and I win because I was the last player to end my movement phase at the target number.)

Owen loves music just as much as I do, so I was excited to share my lifetime love of music with him. I envisioned many happy hours spent together reading about Jimi Hendrix and the Ramones. Unfortunately, this book fell short of our expectations. (I won't mention the name: I'm not here to throw shade--I'm just explaining the genesis of my own book.) It was supposed to be about notable musicians, but some of the featured artists were, um, not quite deserving of that title. For example, I have no beef with Chief Keef, but he probably has a few more years to go before reaching legendary status. Owen was sad. He�d looked forward to this Christmas present. �You know what?� I said. ""I�ll write a music book for you.� And so I did. Introducing For Those About to Rock: A Kid's Guide to 50 Legendary Musical Artists. The book tells the inspiring stories of 50 celebrated popular musicians, including Muddy Waters, Run DMC, The Doors, Bjork, Black Flag, Blondie, and Jimi Hendrix, to name just a few. You can see the full list of featured artists below. Each artist's page includes bite-size fact files and top song titles. In addition, each page has a Music 101 section, which focuses on a musical concept that relates to that particular musician. For example, on Blondie�s page, we talk about liner notes; and on Bjork's page, we discuss musicians who incorporate performance art into their work. You can check it out below. The book will also feature portraits of each musician, created especially for this project by talented artists from all over the world. I say ""will"" because this is where you come in. I want to expand this book's audience to all kids ages 8-15 who love rock n' roll and want to know more about it, and to parents and caregivers who want to bond with their kids through a mutual love of music. To do that, I need your help. Your pledge will help me: pay artists to create the remaining 48 musician portraits edit the book print the book pay for shipping costs create the super-cool rewards that will come with the book You'll help me make this book come to life. So, come on: get pledging, and get ready to rock out with your kids. P.S.: I think Owen likes the book. What do you think? DESIGN: Joey Spector ILLUSTRATIONS: Rikke Rosbaek and Joey Spector MUSIC: Antonio Travis THE BOOK For Those About to Rock: A Kid's Guide to 50 Legendary Musical Acts will be a 7x10 softcover book, filled with the stories of 50 epic artists. In its pages, you'll find out all kinds of fascinating musical facts, including why Pink Floyd wrote ""Comfortably Numb;"" what snack Madonna survived on during her early years as a dancer in New York City; and which performer once showed up on stage in a giant, padded Donald Duck costume. The book will also feature 50 original illustrations of rock legends, created just for this project, by talented artists from around the world.

LESSON PLAN: PROTEST MUSIC You will receive a lesson plan designed to teach kids aged 8-15 how rock n� roll has been an essential part of protest movements over the last decades. This was the lesson plan for a course I taught at a charter school in Los Angeles in fall 2018. It includes YouTube and Spotify playlists, and uses music appreciation to help kids understand human rights movements. MUSIC APPRECIATION WORKSHOP I love getting kids to connect with music, and I have extensive experience teaching music appreciation to elementary school children, using rock n' roll as an educational tool to illuminate history and culture. I will come to your school, workplace, library, or other rock-friendly institution, and teach a 90-minute music appreciation workshop.* *Travel costs are not included.

But how do you know which artists are appropriate for family-friendly listening? And what about artists like Prince? Some of his songs are totally kid-appropriate, and some are, well... Darling Nikki. How do you navigate the wild and woolly world of rock in a kid-safe way? If we reach $40,000, all copies of the book will come with a Parent Pamphlet designed to help you introduce your kid to artists that are right for their age group. Each artist in the book will also have a page in the Parent Pamphlet. This page will contain a �What�s in the Music� section, which is a rating system designed to inform parents about the type of content in each artist�s music. Categories include sexuality, violence, drug/alcohol references, positive messages, and consumerism. Each artist also gets an MPAA rating, just like movies do: for example, Buddy Holly�s sweetly innocent tunes get a G rating, whereas the out-there tunes of the Stooges get an R. $50,000: SUPER TOP SECRET STRETCH GOAL If we reach $50,000, all copies of the book will come with a... well, you'll just have to pledge and see. : ) I need your help to pay illustrators to create the rest of the artwork, edit the book, print the first 200 copies, and pay for shipping costs.

And since this book will not be a print-on-demand project the cost of the individual book will be less while the quality of it will be much better. Unfortunately, this means that the upfront costs are considerable! So we are seeking your help in the hopes that we can make a lot of copies of this! Some to donate to school libraries, sell at local bookstores, and make available to Witch Betty fans that attend future productions of �The Real Wicked Witches of Halloween Hills!� All of this with the goal of building witch Betty�s audience and, hopefully, giving us enough interest and momentum to jumpstart a small series! Cause we got more stories to tell! Originally when we conceived of this book both of us saw it in our mind�s eye as a beautiful hardcover children�s book. And it would look great as a hardcover! But printing a hardcover book costs 1.5 times more than a softcover. And the shipping for hardcover is TWICE as much for the shipping of a softcover book. And the reality of the situation was this was our first time doing this! This is our first book. Our first Kickstarter. And we didn�t want to seem like we were being unreasonable in what we were looking to fund. Luckily, for us, we�ve had a lot of amazing support already and it�s still early in our campaign! So we have decided to put these other goals back out there! If we�re able to get this campaign fully funded and stretch it out to these other goals EVERYONE will benefit from it! So check them out below and please pass the word along that things just got cooler! STRETCH GOAL 1 - $7,500 If we hit this goal everyone who has ordered a book will receive an ebook copy as well! AND, if you�re so inclined, you can choose to get your ebook in English or Spanish! STRETCH GOAL 2 - $9,000 If we can smash past our original goal and reach this one ALL BOOKS will be upgraded to a hardcover edition!

Contemplating single motherhood... Testimonials in Support of Looking for Marla ""Looking for Marla takes you on an undersea discovery journey through the surprisingly diverse expressions of gender and sexual identity among marine creatures. I have taught sexuality education classes for ages ranging from kindergarten to senior high school, and this wonderfully imaginative book will be a precious addition to the curriculum. Little kids will marvel at the beautiful illustrations and older youths will appreciate the whimsical rhyming text. For all, the variety of parenting styles and gender expressions depicted in these pages are sure to expand their understanding of the many ways to be human. May they find their own inner Marla."" - Franois Bar | Our Whole Lives Sexuality Education facilitator ""Looking for Marla beautifully illustrates how art can help to communicate scientific information and break down social stereotypes. We at the Norris Center for Natural History are proud to have supported this creative and outstanding book."" - Karen Holl | Professor of Environmental Studies, UC Santa Cruz | Faculty Director, Norris Center for Natural History. ""Looking for Marla is joyful, beautiful and informative. If you are curious about: gender identity, the ocean, its inhabitants or parenting then this is the book for you! This is revelatory reading at its best."" - Beth Rendeiro, M.Ed | Co-founder, More Than Sex Ed. | Trainer, Our Whole Lives, Lifespan Human Sexuality curricula | Educator, UCLA Lab School ""Looking for Marla speaks for the often overlooked and misunderstood ocean creatures.

Timeline of Events & Purchasing Info Timeline Printing: Spring 2019 Arrival of books: Summer 2019 Norris Center Open House: Fall 2019 Book Launch: Summer-Fall 2019 Motivation In wild clownfish populations, a male member will transition into the role of the dominant female of the community when the female of their family is removed, in a process called sequential hermaphroditism. This biological fact is omitted from the iconic movie Finding Nemo and is a story that our book Looking for Marla helps to share and correct. People may not be aware of the truly vast diversity of sex and gender expression and parental care strategies which occurs in the natural world. The creators of Looking for Marla have observed that these stories, our stories, are often grossly misrepresented or altogether excluded from popular media of today. Thus, we believe that the sharing of these narratives is absolutely necessary and long overdue.We hope that you enjoy learning about the ways in which animals of the sea change between sexes and showcase diverse gender roles in their ecosystems. The creators of Looking for Marla worked with the Diversity Center Youth Groups of Santa Cruz and Watsonville to develop the story. We are happy to share their story to uplift the voices of Queer and Trans youth. Our book draws attention to gender pronoun usage and models what pronouns are and how to use them. We hope that this book will provide support and solidarity for those readers whose stories are so often left untold. The creators of Looking for Marla Our Stories In case you wanted to know a little bit more about who we are and how we got here, the creators of Looking for Marla each wrote about their personal journey to this project, what their hopes and intentions are for its impact, and what role they played in creating it. Paloma (Visionary) As a queer Ph.D. student working in a genetics lab, I studied the ways in which sex chromosomes have evolved in different animals. I found that sex chromosomes, just like any part of DNA, changes over time. The idea that sex chromosomes changed over time shifted the way I think about sex from something stagnant to something dynamic and diverse. I feel excited to bring the examples of gender and sex diversity in nature to a broader audience through the story of Looking for Marla. It was absolutely necessary to center on the voices of queer and trans youth in my community of Santa Cruz to develop the story of a queer clownfish. Working with the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz was an absolute joy, and intimidating as well. Stepping outside of my science + school campus bubble is challenging for me, but it was necessary and fundamental to the process of Looking for Marla. It is a dream come true to be able to merge ecology and art through the story of Marla. I feel excited and honored to share this story with the queer and trans communities, with scientists, with parents, and with educators."" Audrey (Writer) ""As a queer artist with a degree in marine biology, this project could not have been a more perfect fit. It started as a silly thought experiment when considering how the story of Finding Nemo would change if aligned with actual biological processes, and now look where we are! My role in the project was to help bring this beautiful story to life through poetry, and I could not be more excited by how its turned out! Working alongside other artists and human beings who share the curiosity and care behind this projects message has been absolutely beautiful. My hope is that someone, somewhere, will pick up this book and be healed by it, feel held by the safety and support in its words, learn something about themselves and their connection to the world. Please help us bring community, warmth, and loving connection to those who believe they are the only one."" Jessie (Illustrator) My role in this project was to create illustrations to bring the characters of this story to life. It was lovely to be able to be involved from the beginning at the book's early stages of conception and to participate in workshops with the youth groups at the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz. I am so grateful to have connected with the talented writers and artists involved in this project as well as the LGBTQ community at UCSC and in Santa Cruz. Although Paloma Medina and I were paired on this project by chance for the Norris Center Art-Science residency, I couldn't have imagined a more perfect project to work on. I grew up going to a Unitarian church, where we were encouraged to discover our own belief system and our own gender and sexuality in a supportive, open-minded, and loving environment. There is a sex-education curriculum called Our Whole Lives, which follows children through their development to teach them about trust and healthy relationships with other people as well as with yourself. Both of my parents were instructors for this course and we would have long discussions about the best way to communicate these topics to young children navigating these issues for the first time. My father still teaches this course to junior high and high school students, and he is excited to incorporate the book in his discussions about sex and gender. I hope that this book is able to reach those young people searching for themselves, to support those who have found themselves but who are struggling to communicate their identity to their support network, as well as those who can use this book to learn how to support the voyages of their friends and family. I hope this book broadens our minds and our hearts and allows us to be more accepting of the beautiful, vibrant spectrum of identities in our animal kingdom. Sofia (Designer) ""The most rewarding part of being an artist is working on amazing projects with great people! Looking for Marla is a book with a purpose I believe in and advocate for, and I am honored to have been able to help them bring Looking for Marla to life as their book layout artist! As an anthropology undergraduate student at UCSC, I understand the importance of representation in the media. I hope that this book can touch the hearts of children and adults alike, while also providing a fun lesson in biology too!"" Where to buy? Here! Now! From the Looking for Marla team.

Currently, I have a masters degree in Psychological Counseling from Nicholls State University. Ive worked as a disability case manager for four years, and Im currently a multi systemic therapist. Ive been in this position for three years. A lot of times we gloss over our mental health because were too busy, were afraid of what our family or friends might say, or because of the negative stereotypes associated with it. For those strong enough to admit, Hey, something is wrong. Im sad all of the time. One minute Im hot, one minute Im cold. My mood is all over the place. I cant function today. Im exhausted. Im so tired, but I cant seem to fall asleep. My brain cant seem to focus today. I cant believe my loved one is gone. I cant breathe, my chest hurts, how will I live without them. The list of statements can go on and on, yet, the individual may not know how to seek help or where to start. We live in a microwaveable society. Today everyone wants something quick. The same works with mental illness, anxiety, stress, etc. When an individual realizes they are dealing with an issue they want it fixed QUICK. Although I nor other healthcare professions can help you heal over night, Sip Tea and Heal Me can help provide temporary symptomatic relief to stress, mood, focus and attention, adhd, inflammation, pms symptoms, and also helps fight cancer, while providing you with a list techniques and activities to help you assess your feelings, while seeking out professional help. My tea bags are handmade and filled with the necessary organic leaves provided by me. (ie: lavender and chamomile tea bags will consist of chamomile flowers, lavender flowers, and mint leaves all in a cotton, draw string, sealed tea bag). Teas made with Chamomile: help with insomnia, aids hair and nail growth, boost immune symptoms, and helps soothe anxiety. Teas made with Lemon Balm: reduce stress, elevate mood, decrease feelings of depression, helps with fatigue, soothes constipation, reduces PMS, and battles inflammation. Lavender and peppermint are also two additives that assist in calming and soothing stress and anxiety. My goal/funds will be used: 1.) To bring awareness to mental health through addressing stigmas and stereotypes to them. 2.) Provide a list of universal resources that can assist individuals with seeking help. 3.)With each item purchased, provide a workbook for individuals that consists of coping skills for anxiety, depression, insomnia, mood stabilizing, and stress to assist with treatment and healing while theyre seeking help. 4.) To encourage individuals to use natural, alternative methods to medicines, when possible, through the utilization of tea and lemonade along with seeing a mental health professional or physician. Studies have shown that certain teas assist with fatigue, mood stabilizing (hyperactivity and depression), focus and attention (ADD and ADHD), insomnia, and stress. 5.) I would like to go into the schools and after school programs to speak with the youth about things that they may be feeling or experiencing but dont know how to describe their feelings or who they should talk to. Along with giving them a workbook for their ages with coping skills on bullying, body changes, self-esteem issues, anxiety, and focus and attention. Please be mindful that tea should not take the place of seeking help from a physician or mental health professional nor should it replace medications that you are currently taking without seeking medical help. However, it can improve symptoms and hopefully be the reason a medication can be discontinued. Disclaimer: Please avoid Chamomile Tea and consult a doctor if your are currently taking blood thinners, are allergic to Chamomile or any of its properties, or have any other medical issues/allergies of concern that may need to be consulted with a doctor before consuming any of the above teas. Please avoid Lemon Balm if you have a hypothyroidism diagnosis. Certain tea recipes may contain dairy. Please feel free to modify recipe any of my recipes to fit your needs."

Have your parents been diagnosed with a long-term or chronic illness? Are you a parent that has been diagnosed with a chronic disease? If your family has been touched by illness you cannot afford to miss this documentary! The new Independent Documentary Film 'Children of Disease' tells the stories of four families across the United States as they struggle to simultaneously battle parental chronic illness and raise healthy children. The film explores the effects of growing up with an ill parent on children, teens, and young adults. A 'Child of Disease' is someone who's parent(s) was diagnosed with a chronic illness anytime before the child turned 18. These children witness their parents become ill and stay ill long term, a heartbreaking experience that one should not have to face until well into adulthood. The children growing up this way have experiences that most children will never face, making children of disease feel isolated from the rest of their peers. 'Children of Disease' may act out, withdraw, experience anxiety and depression, develop physical health issues themselves, or simply have their world view altered in an unhealthy and isolating way. The film also features Dr. Rebecca B. Skolnick Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist and Co-founder of MindWell NYC, and the organization Wonders & Worries, which offers free professional support for children and teens during a parent's serious illness. Together these professionals offer information and education throughout the film on how families battling parental illness can best cope and endure these difficult situations. Meet the families: Meet the Professionals: Visit the Wonders & Worries Website to learn more about the services they offer! Read the Article written by Rebecca and her mother: ""Helping Your Child Cope with a Chronically Ill Parent"" Visit the Mindwell NYC website! Parents diagnosed with chronic illness often struggle with feelings of helplessness and distress in regards to their childrens well-being, feeling as though everything is out of their control and they have no way of knowing if their child is okay. A note from the Director: I, Madison VanDerlinde am making this film because I am a 'Child of Disease'. Growing up with a chronically ill father (and for a short time an ill mother) has had a lasting impact on my life. My sister and I watched my father struggle endlessly to keep his body functioning. The children around us as we grew up had no idea the hardship my whole family was facing and continues to face. I absolutely hate the idea of other children growing up feeling as isolated and hopeless as my sister and I felt while we watched my father come in and out of the hospital, try medication after medication, and endure ailment after ailment. For a child one of the scariest things to confront is losing a parent. When a parent is ill children are confronted with this reality everyday. While most children are focusing on school work, fighting with friends, and playing on the playground 'Children of Disease' are worrying about their parents, trying to be strong, and wondering why this is happening to them. It is an unfair way to grow up, but I know we can make it better by talking about it. There are so many families in similar situations to my own, but for some reason there is no sense of community. I aim to change all that and tell the 'Children of Disease' everywhere that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Join our mission to unite families battling parental illness! We can't do it with out you!

Reforge is a weapon crafting, battle royale card game! It combines the fun of crafting a unique blade with the polyhedral dice combat of D&D! Players start the game with a lowly wooden grip and Adventurer blade and compete on the tabletop battlefield to forge more powerful weapons with a plethora of grips, guards, and blades to power up their attack and defense, all while utilizing gadgets and shields to turn the tides of battle in their favor. The last player standing wins! For more detailed rules, scroll down a bit or watch our video! The detailed rules and a printable PDF version of the rules can be found here! Photo from demo event at Cool Comics & Games in Cape Coral, FL. All 56 unique cards included in Reforge. Here's how they fit together during a game. Here's the layout with a four player game. Where did the idea come from? The idea for Reforge came to me (Stephen) in a dream early 2019 that involved a card game where you build swords. I immediately started writing down what I saw in my dream and built off of that. The game mechanics came after as I experimented with custom made cards. After working tirelessly for a couple months, I had a product that I was happy to show to the world! After doing some conventions and demos, I'm really looking forward to getting the game into peoples hands! I work full time in a hospital, but have always wanted to create. I haven't stopped since this idea came to me, and I don't intend to until it is realized! About the team! The team for Reforge includes game designer Stephen Royka and artist Sam Donez (Twixxo). After being best friends since high school, we decided to make something awesome together! Reforge is the result of decades of love for gaming and cartoon art. I (Stephen) love videogames, with my favorites being Okami, Resident Evil 4, Hollow Knight, and Bloodborne to name a few. I work as an ultrasound tech to pay for my love of game design. I'm hoping to be able to transition into working full time on card game design for my new company Secret Boss Games someday! Sam is an artist by hobby and trade. While he kicks ass at cartoon art, his real focus is 3D environmental design. Check out his stuff on his website, Art By Twixxo! Why the $6,000 goal? The initial goal is primarily to cover production costs for game and shipping costs from the factory. We are trying to keep this goal as low as possible because we really want this to get made. From the quotes we've gotten, it's looking like this will just be enough to cover all those costs. We have put tons of time, money, and effort into this project and want nothing more than to see it become a reality that people love! And what about that $8,000 stretch goal? (Reduced from $10,000!) If we hit that response, then every copy of Reforge purchased on the Kickstarter will include four sets of polyhedral dice! You need dice to play the game, but we have a solution just in case we don't reach that stretch goal. A webapp will be available for free that acts as a companion for Reforge to keep track of health and roll attack die! The app is currently in development, but a preview of its functionality can be seen here. We really want to ship the game with dice for a complete experience (and we know most people would prefer the feel of real dice!) so we really hope we can reach this goal! We recently received new quotes from manufacturing facilities, so we will be able to bring Reforge to everyone with dice if we reach our stretch goal of $8,000! Check below for info on gameplay, rewards, and more! For more of the nitty gritty details for the rules, check out the complete rule list here! Thank you to all the generous Tier 7 backers! Here are the Final Blades that they came up with that will be included in every copy of Reforge!"

This is an all-or-nothing Kickstarter project  if we don't reach our goal within the 30 days, we don't receive any of your pledged funds! Please read on While we in the Rae Gordon Band still love our award-winning CD Better Than I Was, it's been two years since it came outand our fans say it's high time we unleashed some new music on the world! So that's exactly what we're going to do, with your help. We have a great collection of songs all written and ready to go  this CD will actually be the first Rae Gordon Band release to feature all original tunes and no covers. The songs range from lowdown blues to danceworthy soul to heart-wrenching ballad to horn-drenched funk and always, always back to the blues. We're having huge fun playing them and we are so excited to bring them to you. We'll be recording the CD at Jimi Bott's Roseleaf Recording, with our guitarist/vocalist Kivett Bednar producing. Besides being an award-winning drummer with a jaw-dropping list of credits (The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Rod Piazza & The Mighty Flyers, and most recently the blues supergroup The Proven Ones), Jimi Bott is also an accomplished engineer and producer, with names like Ben Rice, the Mannish Boys All-Stars, Kevin Selfe And The Tornadoes, Mark Hummel and Paul deLay having recorded at his facility. Projects recorded at Roseleaf have received Blues Music Award nominations from the Blues Foundation and Best Recording awards from the Cascade Blues Association. So we're confident our CD is in good hands! But of course, nothing of quality comes for free. Studio time, mixing, mastering, production, package design, photography, duplication, promotion, marketing  all of these are essential to the project's success, and they all come with a cost.

If you feel you can't contribute at this time, we totally understand and just ask that you help us get the word out  we'd appreciate that a bunch! We've had a fantastic couple of years in the Rae Gordon Band, taking 3rd Place at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, releasing Better Than I Was, receiving awards and nominations, and traveling all over to perform for enthusiastic audiences from Florida to Canada. With this new CD we want to take things to the next level and gain new listeners and fans. With you behind us, we're confident we can make it happen.

Funding will allow Girl God Fashion to be presented to interested buyers at Saks and Bergdorf Goodman. Funding in this project pays for Public Relations Marketing. Customers buying into Girl God Apparel need to understand this new form of fashion but familiar statement of empowerment, healing for the soul and the planet. The idea of connecting our personal wars and sharing our beauty from it with others creates a lifetime design. Public Relations will also spread fast the eco friendly results of slow fashion and how it preserves our planet. Public Relations will document the stories from the Veterans who previously wore these jackets in combat before purchased and redesigned. Funding will pay for inventory, art materials and a Design Studio/Showroom for Girl God Apparel. A Design Studio will show that Girl God is capabel to fulfill orders to interested buyers in Paris, New York, London and California.

How the heck does this guy plan to promote such a controversial symbol in a Kickstarter project and get away with it? Well, let me tell you, this symbol has been used in plenty of mainstream media outlets and even in entertainment for children. Shocking, I know! While the Jolly Roger may have once been a symbol of violence and criminality, it is now often seen as a symbol of defiance to authority and adventure (as seen in Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean franchise).  As for the rest of the political symbolism I am advertising here, most of you will probably hate some and love others. Thats the thing about politics, people tend to get emotionally attached to their side and worked up when they see their rivals. Probably because theyre right and the other guys are a bunch of jerks, but I digress. Hello, my name is Eric and I love politics, graphic design, and making enamel pins. However, that last one is fairly new to me. How did I get into it you might ask? It all started many months ago at a friends wedding*flashback* (Yes, we are doing asterisks.) A friend of mine was getting married and asked me to make a design for some Anarcho-Capitalist buttons that all the groomsmen could wear during the ceremony. Totally not weird at all. *cough* Being the good friend I am, I decided to go overboard and make something a bit more lasting and meaningful. Since we were all going to dress up in our finest attire, I thought we should all accessorize accordingly. And down the rabbit hole I went After doing extensive research, finishing the design, and selecting my manufacturer, the pins finally arrived at my door. They look amazing. (See picture below.) Click the image to check it out in my new Etsy store. The above ANCAP pin has a 30mm diameter with black nickel plating. Since the ceremony, Ive been contacted by a couple of other people that attended the wedding about getting some other types of political pins made. One of them is a staunch socialist (she encouraged the hammer & sickle) and another is probably my favorite gay person on the planet (he encouraged the rainbow flag). The first available pins out of the gate are the circular American Flag and Hammer & Sickle. The circular Rainbow Flag will unlock at the first stretch goal of $600. Survey response time will be crucial to making sure this timeline stays accurate. I'm going to do my part in getting the surveys sent out ASAP, so please make sure you keep an eye out for it. I'll also send out an update at the same time. My goal is to beat this timeline if possible, but I'll need everyone's help to make that happen. It is reasonable to assume that there are pins/symbols missing from the list that many of you would have liked. If there is popular support for a pin/symbol, I don't see why it wouldn't be reasonable to squeeze it in. After about halfway through the campaign, I'll compile of list of frequent requests and send out a poll for all backers to vote in. As it becomes feasible, I'll add those pins into the available rewards according to popularity. Time to give some credit where it's due. The image I'm using for the Jolly Roger pins was originally taken from the wikipedia website here. I have made several modifications to the original design, as is permitted in the license here. The person who created the original artwork, Oren Neu Dag, has a page on the wiki commons website. You can view that here."

It's been a dream for a long time to have a cookbook published. I have previously self-published three cookbooks with on demand printing, but that's nothing like a hardbound cookbook with color pages showing the recipes off. I need your help to make this dream become reality. Farm Fresh is a cookbook full of recipes inspired by local farmers and the Farmers Market. There are over 275 pages within this cookbook and it has taken over 4 years to get to this point. The cookbook will include appetizers, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, breakfast items and some of this and that. I also included a special section dedicated to my Grandma Capaul, as she was an awesome baker. I tested the recipes, re-tested them and then photographed them myself. I am proud of what I have accomplished within this cookbook. Farmer's Market Fried Rice About the Author Well, let me give you a little about my background. I have a creative side and enjoy to cook and entertain. I have always enjoyed cooking since I was a youngster. I remember cooking with Grandma Josephine (known as Ma). Although she was not the perfect cook, I learned from her. My training doesn't come from culinary school, but rather comes from my Mother and my Grandmothers and just a lot of practice. As the main person in the family to cook for the Holidays each year, my entertaining experience increased. I also started to cater family & friends' events. Everyone was always asking for my recipes, which I gladly gave to them, but that's when I thought to myself ""Why not do a cookbook?"". So I took family recipes and put my twist on some of them and created ""Family Favorites- From One Generation to the Next"". As a result I gained some experience writing recipes, putting my ideas on paper and testing recipes to ensure my pinch of this and handful that would taste the same. Subsequent to that I also worked on an appetizer cookbook called ""Small Bites Big Taste"". My current project, Farm Fresh, has been my biggest project and I am excited to get it out there. Pan-Seared Cod in White Wine Tomato Basil Sauce Inspired by the Farmer's Market Although the recipes in Farm Fresh have been inspired mainly by the Farmers Market, I have included a few others that I enjoy. While walking through the Farmers Market it is exciting to see the freshness of the produce and products ... and it's also less expensive then the regular store. One of the benefits of shopping the Farmers Market is that you are supporting local farmers, but the best part is that you are getting products at their peak freshness. During a recent visit, a local farmer was selling goat cheese and was passing out samples -what an incredible taste! It made me think about how I could use this cheese at home. While most people would serve it with crackers and maybe some fruit, I decided to do a recipe that would serve it hot with freshly baked crostini. Baked Goat Cheese I need your help This is where you come in. Please help make this dream a REALITY. Check out the rewards and get your own edition of Farm Fresh. I am also looking for Angel donors - your help will be greatly appreciated. If a cookbook isn't your cup of tea, think about giving it as a gift. If your can't afford to help, perhaps you can do me a favor? Please share this kickstarter link with family, friends and co-workers who might enjoy a copy. By passing the word around you are helping me out immensely. THANK YOU - I truly appreciate your help in getting this project funded.
